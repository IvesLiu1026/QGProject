Often simply referred to as alcohol, ethanol is the active ingredient \nin alcoholic beverages. Its simplicity helps it \nsneak across membranes and nestle into a many different nooks, producing a wide range of effects \ncompared to other, clunkier molecules. So how exactly does it cause drunkenness, and why does it have dramatically \ndifferent effects on different people? To answer these questions, we’ll need to follow alcohol \non its journey through the body. Alcohol lands in the stomach \nand is absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract,\nespecially the small intestine. The contents of the stomach \nimpact alcohol’s ability to get into the blood because \nafter eating, the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach \nfrom the small intestine, closes. So the level of alcohol that reaches \nthe blood after a big meal might only be a quarter that\nfrom the same drink on an empty stomach. From the blood, \nalcohol goes to the organs, especially those that get \nthe most blood flow: the liver and the brain. It hits the liver first, \nand enzymes in the liver break down the alcohol molecule \nin two steps. First, an enzyme called ADH turns alcohol \ninto acetaldehyde, which is toxic. Then, an enzyme called ALDH converts the \ntoxic acetaldehyde to non-toxic acetate. As the blood circulates, the liver \neliminates alcohol continuously— but this first pass of elimination \ndetermines how much alcohol reaches the brain and other organs. Brain sensitivity is responsible \nfor the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral effects of alcohol— \notherwise known as drunkenness. Alcohol turns up the brain’s \nprimary brake, the neurotransmitter GABA, and turns down its primary gas, \nthe neurotransmitter glutamate. This makes neurons \nmuch less communicative, and users feel relaxed at moderate doses, \nfall asleep at higher doses, and can impede the brain activity \nnecessary for survival at toxic doses. Alcohol also stimulates \na small group of neurons that extends from the midbrain \nto the nucleus accumbens, a region important for motivation. Like all addictive drugs, it prompts a squirt of dopamine \nin the nucleus accumbens which gives users a surge of pleasure. Alcohol also causes some neurons \nto synthesize and release endorphins. Endorphins help us to calm down \nin response to stress or danger. Elevated levels of endorphins \ncontribute to the euphoria and relaxation associated \nwith alcohol consumption. Finally, as the liver’s breakdown of alcohol \noutpaces the brain’s absorption, drunkenness fades away. Individual differences \nat any point in this journey can cause people \nto act more or less drunk. For example, a man and a woman who weigh \nthe same and drink the same amount during an identical meal will still have \ndifferent blood alcohol concentrations, or BACs. This is because women \ntend to have less blood— women generally have \na higher percentage of fat, which requires less blood than muscle. A smaller blood volume, \ncarrying the same amount of alcohol, means the concentration \nwill be higher for women. Genetic differences in the liver’s alcohol\nprocessing enzymes also influence BAC. And regular drinking can \nincrease production of these enzymes, contributing to tolerance. On the other hand, those who drink \nexcessively for a long time may develop liver damage,\nwhich has the opposite effect. Meanwhile, genetic differences \nin dopamine, GABA, and endorphin transmission \nmay contribute to risk for developing an alcohol use disorder. Those with naturally low endorphin \nor dopamine levels may self-medicate through drinking. Some people have a higher risk \nfor excessive drinking due to a sensitive endorphin response \nthat increases the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Others have a variation \nin GABA transmission that makes them especially sensitive \nto the sedative effects of alcohol, which decreases their risk of developing \ndisordered drinking. Meanwhile, the brain adapts to chronic \nalcohol consumption by reducing GABA, dopamine, and endorphin transmission, \nand enhancing glutamate activity. This means regular drinkers tend \nto be anxious, have trouble sleeping, and experience less pleasure. These structural and functional changes \ncan lead to disordered use when drinking feels normal, \nbut not drinking is uncomfortable, establishing a vicious cycle. So both genetics and previous experience \nimpact how a person experiences alcohol— which means that some people \nare more prone to certain patterns \nof drinking than others, and a history of consumption leads \nto neural and behavioral changes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What molecule is responsible for drunkenness?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ethanol"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Methane"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hydroxide"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How does the contents of the stomach impact alcohol’s ability to get into the blood?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Food absorbs the alcohol, reducing the amount of alcohol absorbed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The pyloric sphincter closes after eating a meal, reducing the amount of alcohol absorbed from the small intestine."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The content of the stomach does not impact alcohol’s ability to get into our bloods"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What organ does alcohol go to first after it is absorbed into the blood?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The heart"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The kidney"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The liver"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why does alcohol impact women’s Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) more than a man’s BAC?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Women tend to have less blood and higher percentage of fat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Men tend to have higher metabolism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "BAC concentration is only influenced by body weight, and not sex"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "True or False: Those with variations in GABA transmission are less likely to develop disordered drinking", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How does alcohol produce sedation, sleepiness, or loss of coordination?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By reducing endorphin activity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By increasing GABA and reducing Glutamate activity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By reducing dopamine activity"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What effect on the brain does alcohol share with all addictive drugs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It’s a very simple molecule and can outsmart the brain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It’s a very complex molecule and can outsmart the brain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It causes a release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, producing pleasurable effects."}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Before them pranced Sun Wukong, \nthe Monkey King. The legendary troublemaker been hatched \nfrom a stone, schooled in divine magic, and was currently brandishing \nthe Dragon Lord’s most treasured weapon. This magical staff, originally large enough to measure \nthe depth of a great flood, now obeyed the Monkey King’s will \nand shrank at his touch. Terrified of this bewildering power, the Dragons graciously allowed \nSun Wukong to keep the staff. The Monkey King stowed the weapon away, and gleefully sped back to his kingdom \nto show this treasure to his tribe of warrior monkeys. After a lavish celebration, \nSun Wukong fell into a deep sleep. But just as he began to dream, the Monkey King \nquickly realized two things. The first was that \nthis was no ordinary slumber. The second was that he wasn’t alone. Suddenly, he found himself caught \nin the clutches of two grisly figures. At first the Monkey King didn’t know \nwho his captors were. But as they dragged him toward \ntheir city’s gates, Sun Wukong realized \nhis deathly predicament. These were soul collectors \ntasked with transporting mortals to the Realm of the Dead. This was the domain of the Death Lords, who mercilessly sorted souls \nand designed gruesome punishments. From here, the kingdom of death \nwas laid out before him. He could see the Death Lord’s palaces, and the fabled bridge \nacross the river Nai He. Manning the bridge was an old woman \nwho offered worthy souls a bowl of soup. After drinking, the spirits \nforgot their previous life, and were sent back to the world \nof the living in a new form. Further below were the souls \nnot worthy of reincarnation. In this twisting maze of chambers, unfortunate spirits endured \nendless rooms of punishment— from mountains spiked with sharp blades, \nto pools of blood and vats of boiling oil. But Sun Wukong was not about to accept \ntorture or reincarnation. As the soul collectors attempted to drag \nhim through the gates, the Monkey King whipped out his staff \nand swung himself out of their clutches. His battle cries and the clang of weapons \nechoed throughout the underworld. Sensing a disturbance, \nthe ten Death Lords swooped upon him. But they had never met such resistance \nfrom a mortal soul. What was this unusual creature? And was he a mortal, a god— \nor something else? The Lords consulted \nthe Book of Death and Life— a tome which showed the time \nof every living soul’s death. Not knowing what category \nthis strange being was under, the Death Lords struggled \nto find Sun Wukong at first; but the Monkey King \nknew just where to look. Unfortunately, the records confirmed \nthe Death Lord’s claim— Sun Wukong was scheduled \nto die this very night. But the Monkey King was not afraid. This was far from the first time \nhe’d defied destiny in his quest for wisdom and power. His past rebellions had earned him \nthe power to transfigure his body, ride clouds at dizzying speeds, and govern\nhis tribe with magic and martial arts. In this crisis, \nhe saw yet another opportunity. With a flash of his nimble fingers, the Monkey King struck \nhis own name from the Book. Before the Death Lords could respond, he found the names of his monkey tribe \nand swept them away as well. Liberated from the bonds of death, Sun Wukong began to battle \nhis way out of the underworld. He deftly defeated endless swarms \nof angry spirits— before tripping on his way \nout of the kingdom. Just before he hit the ground, \nSun Wukong suddenly awoke in his bed. At first he thought the journey \nmight have been a dream, but the Monkey King felt \nhis new immortality surging from the top of his head \nto the tip of his tail. With a cry of triumph, he woke his \nwarriors to share his latest adventure— and commence another round \nof celebration."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many death lords are in the underworld?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "One"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Five"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Seven"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ten"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is NOT one of the Monkey King’s powers", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Magical staff"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Transformation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Commencing fire"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Riding Clouds"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What/where was the Monkey King born out of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Egg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tree"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mountain"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the name of the river under the fabled bridge in the underworld", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nai He"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kuai He"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He Kuai"}, {"label": "D", "text": "He Nai"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What were the spirits offered on the bridge to forget about their past life?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pill"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Soup"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fire"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 15, "lesson": 3, "title": "What's a conure?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/EfUsMZGH", "transcript": {"en": "Welcome to Animal Wonders! Today, we're going to meet some of our amazing\nanimal ambassadors. We're gonna learn about their group, we're\ngoing to talk about why it's confusing sometimes to classify animals, and we're going to talk\na little bit about the terms we use. So, what do you think of when you hear the\nword \"conure\"? If you thought \"LOUD\", you are so right. But, if you didn't even hear the word before,\nyou're me, ten years ago. This, is a conure! A green-cheeked conure to be exact, or you\ncan call her a green-cheek parakeet. I just call her Ginger. And this is where the complication of classifying\nstarts. The word \"conure\" is both an old term and\na new term. It's an old, out-of-date classification for\na genus of parrot-like New World birds and it was called conurus. \"New World\" just means the Americas. Now, the previous genus conurus included some\npresent-day genera that has now been broken apart into more specific groups. Today, the term is used mostly in aviculture,\nwhich is the keeping and breeding of birds in captivity. And I use the term because that's how it was\nfirst introduced to my many Central and South American psittacine friends. But it also helps me explain the difference\nin the groups. So, I've heard of parrots and parakeets before,\nbut what the heck was a conure? This [bird squawks loudly] is a conure! This is a Jenday conure or a Jendaya parakeet--\nboth terms are correct. I call her Ecuador. Now Jenday conures are closely related to\nSun conures and they're very popular in the pet trade. But they are very very vocal. Oh! I soon discovered these birds were one of\nthe most neglected and re-homed groups in the animal rescue world. The more I learned about the individual personalities\nof the birds that I got to rescue, my fascination with these overly exploited and underappreciated\ngroup of birds grew. And the more I tried to define what a conure\nwas, the more complicated it seemed to get. So most people that see a bird with a curved\nbeak - you can do it-- oh! --and bright feathers say, \"That's a parrot,\" and they're correct. So here's how it goes: all parrot-like birds\nbelong to the order Psittaciformes. But then there are families that break them\ndown into smaller groups. The three main families are Psittacidae, Psittaculidae\nand Cacatuidae. The family Psittacidae includes birds like\nmacaws and parrots and conures and parakeets. The family Psittaculidae includes birds like\nlove birds and loris and other Old World parrots. And then the family Cacatuidae includes cockatoos\nand cockatiels and others. So what makes a conure different form a parrot? Well they're not really different. They're just more specific. So, this is a parrot-- [bird squeals]. This is Zoe. She's a red-lored Amazon parrot, and you can\nlook at her-- [bird squawks] --and you can see that she has a very heavy body; and her\ntail-- [bird says \"pretty pretty pretty pretty\"] --her tail is very squared at the bottom. Would you like another treat? No? Ok. But, then you look at-- [bird squawks] --at\nLoulou, the half-moon conure, you can see he has a more slender body, and his tail is\ntapered or cone-shaped. And you can see a big difference in [bird\nsquawks] not just their size, but the shape of their body. So if you look at Loulou and Ecuador, and\nignore the coloration on their feathers, just look at the characteristics on their body. Both of them have a hooked bill, curved in\na very similar way. They have long, tapered tails which are about\nthe same length as their body. They have short feet, and their toe arrangement\nis zygodactyl, which is two toes in the front and two toes in the back. And if you look up at their eyes, they both\nhave a bare patch surrounding their eye. So the group of conures are made up of quite\na few different genera. The main two are Pyrrhura and Aratinga. These two are both in the Aratinga genus,\nand Aratinga means \"mini macaw.\" Speaking of, this, is a macaw! This is Joy, and she's a blue and gold macaw--\nYou so excited? --now you can see she's much larger than Lulu\nand Equador, but she has similar characteristics in her body. You can see that she has almost a slender\nbody, and this long, tapered tail that's pretty much the same length as her body. So we met three conures, a parrot, and now\na macaw. But what's the difference between a parakeet\nand a conure? Well, this is a parakeet. His name is Zapper. He's an Alexandrian parakeet, or, an Alexandrian\nparrot. He can't be considered a conure even though\nhe has a long, tapered tail and the slender body of a conure. He is found in India, Thailand, and Afghanistan,\nand surrounding areas. So, he's considered an Old World parrot instead\nof a New World parrot. He's also part of the family Psittaculidae,\ninstead of Psittacidae. So let's meet another conure. This is Maui, and she's a color-morph with\na green-cheek conure. She's referred to as a pineapple green-cheek\nconure. Note her long, slender tail and cone shape\nlike that-- so she belongs to the parakeet group --but she also lives in the New World\nso she can be defined as a conure. So let's really classify her. Her order is Psittaciformes, her family is\nPsittacidae, and then her genus is Pyrrhura, as opposed to Aratinga, which was Lulu and\nEcuador, the other one. Now let's make things even more fun! This is a parrotlet. A Pacific parrotlet named Sprinkles, and he\nis a parrot, but not a parakeet. Notice his heavy body set and his tail, when\nspread out, is going to look like a square, very similar to our Amazon parrot Zoe. And lastly, we have Boxer, the peach-faced\nlovebird. He's not a conure, and he's not a parakeet. He looks very similar to Sprinkles the parrotlet,\nbut he is an Old World parrot. Very small little parrot, but he does not\nbelong to the family Psittacidae like Sprinkles does, but he belongs to the family Psittaculidae,\nlike Zapper our Alexandrian parakeet. But, unlike Zapper, he's not a parakeet, he's\na small parrot with a heavy body and a square tail. Alright guys, so to wrap this up, all conures\nare parrots, but not all parrots are conures. All conures are parakeets, but not all parakeets\nare conures. And all parakeets are parrots, but not all\nparrots are parakeets. Make sense?

{"page": 15, "lesson": 4, "title": "The surprising habits of original thinkers - Adam Grant", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-surprising-habits-of-original-thinkers-adam-grant", "transcript": {"en": "Seven years ago, a student came to me\nand asked me to invest in his company. He said, \"I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt\nan industry by selling stuff online.\" And I said, \"OK, you guys spent\nthe whole summer on this, right?\" \"No, we all took internships\njust in case it doesn't work out.\" \"All right, but you're going to\ngo in full time once you graduate.\" \"Not exactly. We've all\nlined up backup jobs.\" Six months go by, it's the day before the company launches, and there is still\nnot a functioning website. \"You guys realize,\nthe entire company is a website. That's literally all it is.\" So I obviously declined to invest. And they ended up\nnaming the company Warby Parker. (Laughter) They sell glasses online. They were recently recognized\nas the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now? My wife handles our investments. Why was I so wrong? To find out, I've been studying people\nthat I come to call \"originals.\" Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people\nwho stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity\nand change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today\nthree things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them. So the first reason\nthat I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow\ngetting off the ground. Now, you are all intimately familiar\nwith the mind of a procrastinator. Well, I have a confession for you.\nI'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. Yes, that's an actual term. You know that panic you feel\na few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. I just feel that\na few months ahead of time. (Laughter) So this started early: when I was a kid,\nI took Nintendo games very seriously. I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop\nuntil I had mastered them. Eventually it got so out of hand\nthat a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side\nof Nintendo, starring me. (Laughter) (Applause) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. (Laughter) But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis\nfour months before the deadline. And I was proud of that,\nuntil a few years ago. I had a student named Jihae,\nwho came to me and said, \"I have my most creative ideas\nwhen I'm procrastinating.\" And I was like, \"That's cute,\nwhere are the four papers you owe me?\" (Laughter) No, she was one\nof our most creative students, and as an organizational psychologist,\nthis is the kind of idea that I test. So I challenged her to get some data. She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys\nabout how often they procrastinate. Then she gets their bosses to rate\nhow creative and innovative they are. And sure enough,\nthe precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. So I want to know what happens\nto the chronic procrastinators. She was like, \"I don't know.\nThey didn't fill out my survey.\" (Laughter) No, here are our results. You actually do see that the people\nwho wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off\nthat they don't have any new ideas. And on the flip side,\nthe people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they\ndon't have original thoughts either. There's a sweet spot\nwhere originals seem to live. Why is this? Maybe original people\njust have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating\ndoes not cause creativity. To find out, we designed some experiments. We asked people\nto generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative\nand useful they are. And some of them are asked\nto do the task right away. Others we randomly assign\nto procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough,\nthe moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative\nthan the other two groups. Now, Minesweeper is awesome,\nbut it's not the driver of the effect, because if you play the game first\nbefore you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're\ngoing to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active\nin the back of your mind, that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time\nto consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways,\nto make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing\nthese experiments, I was starting to write\na book about originals, and I thought, \"This is the perfect time\nto teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter\non procrastination.\" So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting\nprecrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list\nwith steps on how to procrastinate. (Laughter) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making\nprogress toward my goal. I started writing\nthe procrastination chapter, and one day -- I was halfway through -- I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it,\nI had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it, \"You call it procrastinating.\nI call it thinking.\" And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals\nin history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions\nhe took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before\nthe biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience\nwaiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes\nand crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words\nthat changed the course of history: \"I have a dream.\" That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing\nthe speech until the very last minute, he left himself open\nto the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vice\nwhen it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start\nbut they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed\nwith Warby Parker. When they were dragging\ntheir heels for six months, I looked at them and said, \"You know, a lot of other companies\nare starting to sell glasses online.\" They missed the first-mover advantage. But what I didn't realize was\nthey were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online. And it turns out the first-mover\nadvantage is mostly a myth. Look at a classic study\nof over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers\nwho created the market with the improvers who introduced\nsomething different and better. What you see is that the first movers\nhad a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent\nfor the improvers. Look at Facebook,\nwaiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. Look at Google, waiting for years\nafter Altavista and Yahoo. It's much easier to improve\non somebody else's idea than it is to create\nsomething new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that\nto be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better. But that wasn't the only reason\nI passed on Warby Parker. They were also full of doubts. They had backup plans lined up, and that made me doubt\nthat they had the courage to be original, because I expected that originals\nwould look something like this. (Laughter) Now, on the surface, a lot of original people look confident, but behind the scenes, they feel the same fear and doubt\nthat the rest of us do. They just manage it differently. Let me show you: this is a depiction of how the creative process\nworks for most of us. (Laughter) Now, in my research, I discovered\nthere are two different kinds of doubt. There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test,\nto experiment, to refine, just like MLK did. And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap\nfrom step three to step four. Instead of saying, \"I'm crap,\" you say, \"The first few drafts\nare always crap, and I'm just not there yet.\" So how do you get there? Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use. We can predict your job performance\nand your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. Now, some of you are not\ngoing to like the results of this study -- (Laughter) But there is good evidence\nthat Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform\nInternet Explorer and Safari users. Yes. (Applause) They also stay in their jobs\n15 percent longer, by the way. Why? It's not a technical advantage. The four browser groups\non average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels\nof computer knowledge. It's about how you got the browser. Because if you use\nInternet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option\nthat was handed to you. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,\nyou had to doubt the default and ask, is there\na different option out there, and then be a little resourceful\nand download a new browser. So people hear about this study\nand they're like, \"Great, if I want to get better at my job,\nI just need to upgrade my browser?\" (Laughter) No, it's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative\nto doubt the default and look for a better option. And if you do that well, you will open yourself up\nto the opposite of déjà vu. There's a name for it.\nIt's called vuja de. (Laughter) Vuja de is when you look at something\nyou've seen many times before and all of a sudden\nsee it with fresh eyes. It's a screenwriter\nwho looks at a movie script that can't get the green light\nfor more than half a century. In every past version,\nthe main character has been an evil queen. But Jennifer Lee starts to question\nwhether that makes sense. She rewrites the first act, reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes\nthe most successful animated movie ever. So there's a simple message\nfrom this story. When you feel doubt, don't let it go. (Laughter) What about fear? Originals feel fear, too. They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart\nfrom the rest of us is that they're even more\nafraid of failing to try. They know you can fail\nby starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run,\nour biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo,\nif you look at the science, are the chances not taken. Elon Musk told me recently,\nhe didn't expect Tesla to succeed. He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit,\nlet alone get back, but it was too important not to try. And for so many of us,\nwhen we have an important idea, we don't bother to try. But I have some good news for you. You are not going to get judged\non your bad ideas. A lot of people think they will. If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea,\ntheir most important suggestion, 85 percent of them stayed silent\ninstead of speaking up. They were afraid of embarrassing\nthemselves, of looking stupid. But guess what? Originals\nhave lots and lots of bad ideas, tons of them, in fact. Take the guy who invented this. Do you care that he came up\nwith a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids\nbut adults, too? No. You celebrate Thomas Edison\nfor pioneering the light bulb. (Laughter) If you look across fields, the greatest originals\nare the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most. Take classical composers,\nthe best of the best. Why do some of them get more pages\nin encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions\nrerecorded more times? One of the best predictors is the sheer volume\nof compositions that they generate. The more output you churn out,\nthe more variety you get and the better your chances\nof stumbling on something truly original. Even the three icons of classical music --\nBach, Beethoven, Mozart -- had to generate hundreds\nand hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller\nnumber of masterpieces. Now, you may be wondering, how did this guy become great\nwithout doing a whole lot? I don't know how Wagner pulled that off. But for most of us,\nif we want to be more original, we have to generate more ideas. The Warby Parker founders, when they\nwere trying to name their company, they needed something sophisticated,\nunique, with no negative associations to build a retail brand, and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker. So if you put all this together,\nwhat you see is that originals are not that different\nfrom the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt.\nThey procrastinate. They have bad ideas. And sometimes, it's not in spite\nof those qualities but because of them that they succeed. So when you see those things,\ndon't make the same mistake I did. Don't write them off. And when that's you,\ndon't count yourself out either. Know that being quick to start\nbut slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself\nby doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try, and that you need a lot of bad ideas\nin order to get a few good ones. Look, being original is not easy, but I have no doubt about this: it's the best way\nto improve the world around us. Thank you.

The defendant in this 1947 case \nwas an art forger who had counterfeited millions of dollars \nworth of paintings. But he wasn’t arguing his innocence— in fact, his life depended on proving \nthat he had committed the fraud. Like many art forgers, \nHan van Meegeren was an artist whose original works had failed \nto bring him renown. Embittered towards the art world, van Meegeren set out to make fools \nof his detractors. He learned all he could \nabout the Old Masters— their biographies, their techniques, \nand their materials. The artist he chose for his deception \nwas 17th century Baroque painter Johannes Vermeer— an ambitious decision given Vermeer \nwas famed for his carefully executed and technically brilliant domestic scenes. Working in secret for six years, \nthe forger perfected his art, copying numerous works as practice. He mixed his own paints \nafter researching the raw materials and pigments available in Vermeer’s time. He bought 17th century canvases, \ncreated his own brushes, and aged the works \nby applying synthetic resin and baking them to dry \nand crack the paint. A forensic test could have detected \nthe synthetic resin. But at the time, such tests \nwere neither advanced nor widespread, and even today verification \nof a painting’s authenticity relies on the assessment \nof art specialists. So it’s a matter of their subjective \njudgment— as well as their reputation. And this is where van Meegeren \ntruly outwitted the art world. From his research, he knew historians \nbelieved Vermeer had an early period of religious painting influenced \nby the Italian painter Caravaggio. The leading authority on Vermeer, \nAbraham Bredius, was a huge proponent of this theory, \nthough none of these works had surfaced. So van Meegeren decided to make one. He called it \"The Supper at Emmaus.\" Bredius declared van Meegeren’s fake \nthe masterpiece of Vermeer’s oeuvre. Van Meegeren’s forgery was not totally \nup to Vermeer’s technical standards, but these inconsistencies \ncould be made to fit the narrative: this was an early work, produced before \nthe artist had come into his own. With the stamp of approval \nfrom the art world, the fake was sold in 1937 \nfor the equivalent of over $4 million in today’s money. The success prompted van Meegeren \nto forge and sell more works through various art dealers. As unbelievable as it may sound, the art world continued to believe \nin their authenticity. When the Nazis occupied Holland \nduring the Second World War, Hermann Göring, \none of Hitler’s top generals, sought to add a Vermeer \nto his collection of artwork looted from all over Europe. Van Meegeren obliged, selling him \nan alleged early Vermeer painting titled \"Christ with the Adulteress.\" As the tide of the war turned, \nso did van Meegeren’s luck. Following the Allied victory, he was \narrested for delivering a priceless piece of Dutch heritage to the Nazis— \nan act of treasonous collaboration punishable by death. To prove the painting \nwasn’t a national treasure, he explained step-by-step \nhow he had forged it. But he faced an unexpected obstacle— \nthe very expert who had enabled his scam. Moved to protect his reputation, Bredius \ndefended the painting’s authenticity. With few options left, van Meegeren \nset to work on a \"new\" Vermeer. When he presented the fake to the court, \nthey finally believed him. He was acquitted for collaborating \nwith the Nazis— and sentenced to a year imprisonment \nfor fraud. Though there’s evidence that van Meegeren \ndid, in fact, collaborate with the Nazis, he managed to convince the public \nthat he had tricked Göring on purpose, transforming his image into that \nof a folk hero who had swindled the Nazis. Thanks to this newfound notoriety, his works became valuable \nin their own right— so much so that they were later forged \nin turn by his own son. The same canvases went from \nrevered classics to despised forgeries to works of art respected for the skill \nand notoriety of the forger."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which aspect of van Meegeren’s forgeries would have been revealed as such had they been subject to forensic testing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "canvases were modern"}, {"label": "B", "text": "resin should not have been present"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pigments post-dated the supposed era of the painting"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the wooden support of the canvas was too young"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which Nazi leader did van Meegeren trick with his forgeries?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Adolf Hitler"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Heinrich Himmler"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Alfred Rosenberg"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hermann Goring"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How did van Meegeren set a trap for Vermeer expert Abraham Bredius?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He painted in a style that fulfilled Bredius’ unsubstantiated theory about Vermeer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He made an exact copy of a Vermeer that Bredius had authenticated"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He created what appeared to be a famous lost Vermeer about which Bredius had written"}, {"label": "D", "text": "He included a portrait of Bredius’ ancestor into the purported Vermeer painting"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why do most art forgers first turn to forgery?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They want to make money and see this as the best way to do so while still making art"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They feel unfulfilled by their original creations and rejected by the art world, so seek revenge"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are looking to become famous so are eager to be caught, after a successful fraud or two"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are testing themselves to see if they can match the skill level of the greats"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the title of van Meegeren’s most famous Vermeer forgery?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Supper with a Mouse"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Supper at Emmaus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dinner with Emmaus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Supper with Caravaggio"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Because guess what? It’s almost National Coloring Day! [Squeaks cheers] National Coloring Day is just what it sounds\nlike: a day to color and have fun. And that’s exactly what we’re going to\ndo … with a special project. We’re going to make some invisible ink! That means the ink will disappear, and then\nyou can color over it to reveal a secret message. All you’ll need is baking soda, water, purple\ngrape juice, two cups, a cotton swab like a Q-tip, and either a paint brush or a cotton ball. Oh, and a piece of white paper to write on,\nand a grown-up, of course! The first thing we’ll do is mix a quarter\nof a cup of baking soda and a quarter of a cup of water. The measurements don’t need to be exact\n— we’re just trying to make sure we have about\nthe same amount of each. This baking soda-water mixture will be our\nink! [Squeaks is surprised by how simple it is] Yep, that’s all there is to it! Let’s write something on this paper here. Hmmm … let me think of a secret message\nfor you, Squeaks … OK! Now all we have to do is wait for it to dry,\nand the message will be hidden! It looks like the ink is dry, so the secret\nmessage is ready to be revealed! The question is, are you ready, Squeaks? Let’s do it, then! This is what the grape juice is for. We’ll dip the brush into the grape juice,\nand paint over the message. Check it out! Science is awesome That was the message! There are lots of ways to make invisible ink\nat home, but this is one of the easiest — and, I think, the coolest! Because we’re doing the same thing lots\nof scientists do in their labs every day! No, they’re not writing secret messages. But they do mix things together to learn more\nabout them, like we just did! The baking soda we used to make the invisible\nink is really a type of chemical called a base. And when we added the grape juice to the base\non the paper, they reacted to each other! That means they changed. When it touched the baking soda, a chemical\nin the grape juice changed to become darker. That’s why the parts of the paper where\nthe message was got darker, and we were able to read it! Now, baking soda is a safe chemical, so we\ncan cook with it and use it for experiments at home, but scientists use it in their labs\nsometimes, too. Actually, scientists use all kinds of bases\nin their labs, and sometimes they need to be able to test\nif a chemical is a base. To do that, they combine the chemical with\nsomething called an indicator. That’s another chemical that scientists\nknow will change color if it mixes with a base. And guess what? One of the ingredients in grape juice works\nas an indicator! It’s called an anthocyanin, and it becomes\na darker purple color when it touches a base. [Squeaks points out that grape juice is already\npurple] That’s true, the grape juice is already\npurple! But when it touches a base like baking soda,\nit becomes a much darker purple. So that’s the scientific secret to our invisible\nink. And now we can write all the secret messages\nto each other we want … as long as we have some grape juice on hand! Thanks for joining us!

As the ruler of the city, \nyou’d always dismissed the stories… until today, when 7 Leviathan Lords \nrose out of the roiling waters and surrounded your city. Each commands 10 giant kraken, and each kraken \nis accompanied by 12 mermites. Your city’s puny army \nis hopelessly outmatched. You think back to the legends. In the stories, the ruler of the city \nsaved his people by feeding the creatures \na ransom of pearls. The pearls would be split equally \nbetween the leviathans lords. Each leviathan would then divide its share\ninto 11 equal piles, keeping one, and giving the other 10 \nto their kraken commanders. Each kraken would then divide its share \ninto 13 equal piles, keeping one, and distributing the other \ntwelve to their mermite minions. If any one of these divisions left \nan unequal pile or leftover pearl, the monsters would pull everyone \nto the bottom of the sea. Such was the fate \nof your fabled sister city. You rush to the ancient treasure room \nand find five chests, each containing a precisely counted number\nof pearls prepared by your ancestors \nfor exactly this purpose. Each of the chests bears a number \ntelling how many pearls it contains. Unfortunately, the symbols they used \nto write digits 1,000 years ago have changed with time, and you don’t know how \nto read the ancient numbers. With hundreds of thousands of pearls \nin each chest, there’s no time to recount. One of these chests will save your city and the rest will lead \nto its certain doom. Which do you choose? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough information to decode\nthe ancient Atlantartican numeral system. But all hope is not lost, because there’s another piece \nof information those symbols contain: patterns. If we can find a matching pattern \nin arabic numerals, we can still pick the right chest. Let’s take stock of what we know. A quantity of pearls that can appease \nthe sea monsters must be divisible by 7, 11, and 13. Rather than trying out numbers \nat random, let’s examine ones that have this property and see if there are any \npatterns that unite them. Being divisible by 7, 11, and 13 means that our number must \nbe a multiple of 7, 11, and 13. Those three numbers are all prime, \nso multiplying them together will give us their least \ncommon multiple: 1001. That’s a useful starting place because we now know that any viable \noffering to the sea monsters must be a multiple of 1001. Let’s try multiplying it by a three digit \nnumber, just to get a feel for what we might get. If we try 861 times 1001, we get 861,861, and we see something similar \nwith other examples. It’s a peculiar pattern. Why would multiplying a three-digit \nnumber by 1001 end up giving you two copies \nof that number, written one after the other? Breaking down the multiplication \nproblem can give us the answer. 1001 times any number x is equal \nto 1000x + x. For example, 725 times 1000 is 725,000, \nand 725 x 1 is 725. So 725 x 1001 will be the sum of \nthose two numbers: 725,725. And there’s nothing special about 725. Pick any three-digit number, and your final product will have \nthat many thousands, plus one more. Even though you don’t know how \nto read the numbers on the chests, you can read which pattern of digits \nrepresents a number divisible by 1001. As with many problems, trying concrete\nexamples can give you an intuition for behavior that may at first look\nabstract and mysterious. The monsters accept your ransom \nand swim back down to the depths for another thousand years.

{"page": 15, "lesson": 10, "title": "History vs. Sigmund Freud - Todd Dufresne", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/history-vs-sigmund-freud-todd-dufresne", "transcript": {"en": "Working in Vienna at the turn \nof the 20th century, he began his career as a neurologist before pioneering the discipline \nof psychoanalysis. He proposed that people are motivated \nby unconscious desires and repressed memories, and their problems can be addressed by making those motivations conscious \nthrough talk therapy. His influence towers above that of all \nother psychologists in the public eye. But was Sigmund Freud \nright about human nature? And were his methods scientific? Order, order. \nToday on the stand we have… Dad? Ahem, no, your honor. This is Doctor Sigmund Freud, one of the most innovative thinkers\nin the history of psychology. An egomaniac who propagated \npseudoscientific theories. Well, which is it? He tackled issues medicine \nrefused to address. Freud’s private practice treated women who suffered from what was called \nhysteria at the time, and their complaints hadn’t been taken\nseriously at all. From the women with depression \nhe treated initially to World War I veterans with PTSD, Freud’s talking cure worked, and the visibility he gave his patients \nforced the medical establishment to acknowledge their psychological \ndisorders were real. He certainly didn’t help all his patients. Freud was convinced\nthat our behavior is shaped by unconscious urges \nand repressed memories. He invented baseless unconscious \nor irrational drivers behind the behavior of trauma \nsurvivors— and caused real harm. How’s that? He misrepresented some of his most \nfamous case studies, claiming his treatment had cured patients \nwhen in fact they had gotten worse. Later therapists influenced \nby his theories coaxed their patients into \"recovering\" supposedly repressed memories \nof childhood abuse that never happened. Lives and families were torn apart. You can’t blame Freud for later\nmisapplications of his work— that would be projecting. Plenty of his ideas were harmful \nwithout any misapplication. He viewed homosexuality \nas a developmental glitch. He coined the term penis envy— meaning women are haunted for life\nby their lack of penises. Freud was a product of his era. Yes, some of the specifics were flawed, but he created a new space \nfor future scientists to explore, investigate, and build upon. Modern therapy techniques\nthat millions of people rely on came out of the work he started \nwith psychoanalysis. And today everyone knows \nthere’s an unconscious— that idea was popularized Freud. Psychologists today only believe \nin a “cognitive unconscious,” the fact that you aren’t aware \nof everything going on at a given moment. Freud took this idea way too far, \nascribing deep meaning to everything. He built his theories on scientific ideas\nthat were outdated even in his own time, not just by today’s standards— for example, he thought \nindividual psychology is derived from the biological inheritance\nof events in ancient history. And I mean ancient— \nlike the Ice Age or the killing of Moses. Freud and his closest allies actually \nbelieved these prehistorical traumas had ongoing impacts on human psychology. He thought that the phase \nof cold indifference to sexuality during pubescence was literally \nan echo of the Ice Age. With fantastical beliefs like these,\nhow can we take him seriously? Any renowned thinker from centuries past has ideas that seem fantastical \nby today’s standards, but we can’t discount \ntheir influence on this basis. Freud was an innovator \nlinking ideas across many fields. His concepts have become everyday terms that shape how we understand and talk \nabout our own experiences. The Oedipus complex? Ego and id? \nDefense mechanisms? Death wishes? All Freud. But Freud didn’t present himself as a \nsocial theorist— he insisted that his work was scientific. Are you saying he… repressed\ninconvenient facts? Freud’s theories were unfalsifiable. Wait, so you’re saying he was right? No, his ideas were framed so that \nthere’s no way to empirically verify them. Freud didn’t even necessarily believe \nin the psychoanalysis he was peddling.

Yet for most of its history, the channel’s rocky shores \nand stormy weather made crossing a dangerous prospect. Engineers of the early 1800's \nproposed numerous plans for spanning the 33 kilometer gap. Their designs included artificial islands \nlinked by bridges, submerged tubes suspended \nfrom floating platforms, and an underwater passage more than twice \nthe length of any existing tunnel. By the end of the century, this last proposal had captured \nEuropean imagination. The invention \nof the tunnel boring machine and the discovery of a stable layer \nof chalk marl below the seabed made this fantastic tunnel \nmore feasible. But the project’s most urgent obstacles \nwere ones no engineer could solve. At the time, Britons viewed their geographic isolation \nas a strategic advantage, and fears about French invasion \nshut down plans for the tunnel. The rise of aerial warfare rendered \nthese worries obsolete, but new economic concerns \narose to replace them. Finally, 100 years after \nthe initial excavation, the two countries \nreached an agreement— the tunnel would proceed \nwith private funding. In 1985, a group \nof French and British companies invested the modern equivalent \nof 14 billion pounds, making the tunnel the most expensive \ninfrastructure project to date. The design called \nfor three separate tunnels— one for trains to France, \none for trains to England, and one service tunnel between them. Alongside crossover chambers, \nemergency passages, and air ducts, this amounted to over 200 kilometers \nof tunnels. In 1988, workers began excavating \nfrom both sides, planning to meet in the middle. Early surveys of the French coast \nrevealed the site was full of fault lines. These small cracks \nlet water seep into the rock, so engineers had to develop \nwaterproof boring machines. The British anticipated drier conditions, \nand forged ahead with regular borers. But only months into the work, water \nflooded in through undetected fissures. To drill in this wet chalk, \nthe British had to use grout to seal the cracks \ncreated in the borer’s wake, and even work ahead of the main borer to reinforce the chalk \nabout to be drilled. With these obstacles behind them, \nboth teams began drilling at full speed. Boring machines weighing up to 1,300 tons \ndrilled at nearly 3.5 meters per hour. As they dug, they installed lining rings \nto stabilize the tunnel behind them, making way for support wagons \nfollowing each machine. Even at top speed, \nwork had to proceed carefully. The chalk layer followed a winding path \nbetween unstable rock and clay, punctured by over 100 boring holes \nmade by previous surveyors. Furthermore, both teams had \nto constantly check their coordinates to ensure they were on track to meet \nwithin 2 centimeters of each other. To maintain this delicate trajectory, the borers employed \nsatellite positioning systems, as well as paleontologists \nwho used excavated fossils to confirm they were at the right depth. During construction, \nthe project employed over 13,000 people and cost the lives of ten workers. But after two and a half years \nof tunneling, the two sides finally made contact. British worker Graham Fagg \nemerged on the French side, becoming the first human to cross \nthe channel by land since the Ice Age. There was still work to be done— from installing crossover chambers \nand pumping stations, to laying over a hundred miles of tracks, \ncables, and sensors. But on May 6, 1994, an opening ceremony \nmarked the tunnel’s completion. Full public service began \n16 months later, with trains for passengers \nand rail shuttles for cars and trucks. Today, the Channel Tunnel services \nover 20 million passengers a year, transporting riders across the channel \nin just 35 minutes. Unfortunately, not everyone has \nthe privilege of making this trip legally. Thousands of refugees have tried \nto enter Britain through the tunnel in sometimes fatal attempts. These tragedies have transformed \nthe tunnel’s southern entrance into an ongoing site of conflict. Hopefully, the structure’s history \ncan serve as a reminder that humanity is at their best \nwhen breaking down barriers."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How wide is the English Channel?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "33 kilometers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "14 kilometers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20 kilometers"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What invention made it possible to begin construction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The diesel engine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The hot-air balloon"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The boring machine"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many tunnels actually make up the Channel Tunnel?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "One"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Three"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Five"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the cause of the delay the British team ran into?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Equipment malfunction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Death of chief engineer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Unexpected wet conditions"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When was the tunnel opened for operation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1994"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1988"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2007"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (Laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative,\nI don't really blame you. That's just how the media\nhas been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage\nabout Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans\nsay that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk\nto their Uber drivers. (Laughter) Well, for those of you\nwho have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you. Let me tell you who I am. I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim. But not like Lady Gaga says,\nbecause baby, I wasn't born this way. It was a choice. When I was 17, I decided to come out. No, not as a gay person\nlike some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing\nthe hijab, my head covering. My feminist friends were aghast: \"Why are you oppressing yourself?\" The funny thing was, it was actually at that time\na feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect\nand unattainable standard of beauty. I didn't just passively accept\nthe faith of my parents. I wrestled with the Quran. I read and reflected\nand questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed. My relationship with God --\nit was not love at first sight. It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every\nreading of the Quran. Its rhythmic beauty\nsometimes moves me to tears. I see myself in it.\nI feel that God knows me. Have you ever felt like someone sees you,\ncompletely understands you and yet loves you anyway? That's how it feels. And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer. (Laughter) I later had a child,\nafter getting married, and I was living essentially\nthe Egyptian-American dream. And then that terrible morning\nof September, 2001. I think a lot of you probably remember\nexactly where you were that morning. I was sitting in my kitchen\nfinishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen\nand see the words \"Breaking News.\" There was smoke,\nairplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings. What was this? An accident? A malfunction? My shock quickly turned to outrage. Who would do this? And I switch the channel and I hear, \"... Muslim terrorist ...,\" \"... in the name of Islam ...,\" \"... Middle-Eastern descent ...,\" \"... jihad ...,\" \"... we should bomb Mecca.\" Oh my God. Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions\nhad turned me from a citizen to a suspect. That same day, we had to drive\nacross Middle America to move to a new city\nto start grad school. And I remember sitting\nin the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life,\nafraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim. We moved into our apartment\nthat night in a new town in what felt like\na completely different world. And then I was hearing\nand seeing and reading warnings from national\nMuslim organizations saying things like,\n\"Be alert,\" \"Be aware,\" \"Stay in well-lit areas,\"\n\"Don't congregate.\" I stayed inside all week. And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims\ncongregate for worship. And again the warnings were,\n\"Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target.\" And I was watching the news,\nwall-to-wall coverage. Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing\nabout attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived\nto be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street. Mosques were actually firebombed. And I thought, we should just stay home. And yet, something didn't feel right. Because those people\nwho attacked our country attacked our country. I get it that people were angry\nat the terrorists. Guess what? So was I. And so to have to explain yourself\nall the time isn't easy. I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough. Today we hear people actually\nsaying things like, \"There's a problem in this country,\nand it's called Muslims. When are we going to get rid of them?\" So, some people want to ban Muslims\nand close down mosques. They talk about my community\nkind of like we're a tumor in the body of America. And the only question is,\nare we malignant or benign? You know, a malignant tumor\nyou extract altogether, and a benign tumor\nyou just keep under surveillance. The choices don't make sense,\nbecause it's the wrong question. Muslims, like all other Americans,\naren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes. Now, is closing down mosques\ngoing to make America safer? It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly\nis actually linked to having more tolerant views\nof people of other faiths and greater civic engagement. And as one police chief\nin the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually\nget radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement\nor bedroom, in front of a computer. And what you find\nabout the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off\nfrom their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group\ncan brainwash them into believing that they,\nthe terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors\ntheir behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates. So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people\ngoing to the mosque. Now, some will still argue\nIslam is a violent religion. After all, a group like ISIS\nbases its brutality on the Quran. Now, as a Muslim, as a mother,\nas a human being, I think we need to do everything we can\nto stop a group like ISIS. But we would be giving in\nto their narrative if we cast them as representatives\nof a faith of 1.6 billion people. (Applause) Thank you. ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do\nwith Christianity. (Applause) Both groups claim to base\ntheir ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them,\nthey're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them\nread these things into the scripture. Recently, a prominent imam\ntold me a story that really took me aback. He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking\nof going to join ISIS. And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact\nwith a radical religious leader? And he said the problem\nwas quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had\ntalked to had shut her down and said that her rage,\nher sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble. And so with nowhere to channel\nand make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution. What this imam did was to connect her\nback to God and to her community. He didn't shame her for her rage --\ninstead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world. What she learned at that mosque\nprevented her from going to join ISIS. I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia\naffects me and my family. But how does it impact ordinary Americans? How does it impact everyone else? How does consuming fear 24 hours a day\naffect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought? Well, one study -- actually,\nseveral studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid,\nat least three things happen. We become more accepting\nof authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice. One study showed that when subjects\nwere exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting\nof military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights\nof American Muslims. Now, this isn't just academic. When you look at when\nanti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. It was in the run up to the Iraq War\nand during two election cycles. So Islamophobia isn't just\nthe natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected. It can actually be a tool\nof public manipulation, eroding the very foundation\nof a free society, which is rational\nand well-informed citizens. Muslims are like canaries\nin the coal mine. We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear\nis harming us all. (Applause) And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having\nto explain yourself all the time. Deah and his wife Yusor\nwere a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school. Deah was an athlete. He was in dental school,\ntalented, promising ... And his sister would tell me\nthat he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew. She was visiting him there\nand he showed her his resume, and she was amazed. She said, \"When did my baby brother\nbecome such an accomplished young man?\" Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit\nto her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan,\nwho was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements\non his Facebook page. He shot Deah eight times. So bigotry isn't just immoral,\nit can even be lethal. So, back to my story. What happened after 9/11? Did we go to the mosque\nor did we play it safe and stay home? Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like\na small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America\nwe wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing\nour religion freely. So we decided to go to the mosque. And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently,\nintensely, to the mosque. I took him out, I took off my shoes,\nI walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop. The place was completely full. And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews,\nBuddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us,\nbut to stand in solidarity with us. (Applause) I just break down at this time. These people were there because they chose\ncourage and compassion over panic and prejudice. What will you choose? What will you choose\nat this time of fear and bigotry? Will you play it safe? Or will you join those who say we are better than that? Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. Helen Walters: So Dalia,\nyou seem to have struck a chord. But I wonder, what would you say to those\nwho might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule. What would you say to those people? Dalia Mogahed: I would say,\ndon't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary. I'm not an exception. My story is not unusual. I am as ordinary as they come. When you look at Muslims\naround the world -- and I've done this, I've done\nthe largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace. So I am not in any way an exception. When you meet people who seem\nlike an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it. HW: Thank you so much.\nDalia Mogahed.

{"page": 15, "lesson": 13, "title": "What is schizophrenia? - Anees Bahji", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-schizophrenia-anees-bahji", "transcript": {"en": "Schizophrenia was first identified \nmore than a century ago, but we still don’t know its exact causes. It remains one of the most misunderstood \nand stigmatized illnesses today. So, let’s walk through what we do know— \nfrom symptoms to causes and treatments. Schizophrenia is considered a syndrome, which means it may encompass \na number of related disorders that have similar symptoms \nbut varying causes. Every person with schizophrenia \nhas slightly different symptoms, and the first signs can be easy to miss— \nsubtle personality changes, irritability, or a gradual encroachment \nof unusual thoughts. Patients are usually diagnosed \nafter the onset of psychosis, which typically occurs in the late teens \nor early twenties for men and the late twenties \nor early thirties for women. A first psychotic episode can feature \ndelusions, hallucinations, and disordered speech and behavior. These are called positive symptoms, meaning they occur \nin people with schizophrenia but not in the general population. It’s a common misperception \nthat people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities, but these symptoms indicate a disruption \nof thought processes, rather than the manifestation \nof another personality. Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms, these are qualities that are reduced \nin people with schizophrenia, such as motivation, \nexpression of emotion, or speech. There are cognitive symptoms as well, \nlike difficulty concentrating, remembering information, \nand making decisions. So what causes the onset of psychosis? There likely isn’t one single cause,\nbut a combination of genetic and environmental \nrisk factors that contribute. Schizophrenia has some of the strongest \ngenetic links of any psychiatric illness. Though about 1% of people \nhave schizophrenia, children or siblings of people \nwith schizophrenia are ten times likelier to develop the disease, and an identical twin \nof someone with schizophrenia has a 40% chance of being affected. Often, immediate relatives \nof people with schizophrenia exhibit milder versions of traits \nassociated with the disorder— but not to an extent \nthat requires treatment. Multiple genes almost certainly \nplay a role, but we don’t know how many, or which ones. Environmental factors like exposure \nto certain viruses in early infancy might increase the chance \nthat someone will develop schizophrenia, and use of some drugs, \nincluding marijuana, may trigger the onset of psychosis in highly susceptible individuals. These factors don’t affect \neveryone the same way. For those with very low genetic risk, no amount of exposure \nto environmental risk factors will lead them to develop schizophrenia; for those with very high risk, moderate \nadditional risk might tip the balance. The antipsychotic drugs used to treat \nschizophrenia have helped researchers work backwards to trace signatures \nof the disorder in the brain. Traditional antipsychotics \nblock dopamine receptors. They can be very effective \nin reducing positive symptoms, which are linked to an excess of dopamine \nin particular brain pathways. But the same drugs \ncan make negative symptoms worse, and we’ve found that negative symptoms \nof schizophrenia may be tied to too little dopamine \nin other brain areas. Some people with schizophrenia \nshow a loss of neural tissue, and it’s unclear whether this atrophy \nis a result of the disease itself or drug-induced suppression of signaling. Fortunately, newer generations \nof antipsychotics aim to address some of these issues by targeting \nmultiple neurotransmitters, like serotonin in addition to dopamine. It’s clear that no one transmitter system \nis responsible for all symptoms, and because these drugs affect signaling \nthroughout the brain and body, they can have other \nside effects like weight gain. In spite of these complications, \nantipsychotics can be very effective, especially when combined \nwith other interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy, though \nit provides relatively short-lived relief, is also re-emerging \nas an effective treatment, especially when other options \nhave failed. Early intervention \nis also extremely important. After months or years \nof untreated psychosis, certain psychoses can become embedded \nin someone’s personality. And yet, the dehumanizing stigma \nattached to this diagnosis can prevent people from seeking help. People with schizophrenia \nare often perceived as dangerous, but are actually much more likely \nto be the victims of violence than the perpetrators. And proper treatment may help reduce \nthe likelihood of violence associated with schizophrenia. That’s why education— for patients, \ntheir families, and their communities— helps erode the stigma \nand improves access to treatment."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The most common symptom of schizophrenia are _____ hallucinations.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Auditory (voices/sounds)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Visual (visions)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Olfactory (smells)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tactile (touch)"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Schizophrenia is a type of _____ disorder.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mood"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Anxiety"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Psychotic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Personality"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia in the general population is ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20%"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The key neurotransmitter thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dopamine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Serotonin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Epinephrine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Glutamate"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "One of the most effective treatments for schizophrenia are ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Antipsychotic medications"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Antidepressant medications"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Antianxiety medications"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Anticraving medication"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Go on. What do you feel? Soft? Squishy? It's you, right? You're feeling you? Well, it's not quite true. You're actually feeling\nthousands of microscopic creatures that live on our face and fingers. You're feeling some of the fungi that drifted down\nfrom the air ducts today. They set off our allergies and smell of mildew. You're feeling some\nof the 100 billion bacterial cells that live on our skin. They've been munching away\nat your skin oils and replicating, producing the smells of body odor. You're likely even touching\nthe fecal bacteria that sprayed onto you the last time\nyou flushed a toilet, or those bacteria that live\nin our water pipes and sprayed onto you\nwith your last shower. Sorry. (Laughter) You're probably even giving\na microscopic high five to the two species of mites\nthat live on our faces, on all of our faces. They've spent the night\nsquirming across your face and having sex on the bridge of your nose. (Laughter) Many of them are now leaking\ntheir gut contents onto your pores. (Laughter) Now look at your finger. How's it feel? Gross? In desperate need of soap or bleach? That's how you feel now, but it's not going to be\nhow you feel in the future. For the last 100 years, we've had an adversarial relationship with the microscopic life nearest us. If I told you there was\na bug in your house or bacteria in your sink, there was a human-devised\nsolution for that, a product to eradicate, exterminate, disinfect. We strive to remove most\nof the microscopic life in our world now. But in doing so, we're ignoring\nthe best source of new technology on this planet. The last 100 years have featured\nhuman solutions to microbial problems, but the next 100 years will feature\nmicrobial solutions to human problems. I'm a scientist, and I work\nwith researchers at North Carolina State University\nand the University of Colorado to uncover the microscopic\nlife that is nearest us, and that's often in our most intimate\nand boring environments, be it under our couches, in our backyards, or in our belly buttons. I do this work because it turns out\nthat we know very little about the microscopic life\nthat's nearest us. As of a few years ago,\nno scientist could tell you what bugs or microorganisms\nlive in your home -- your home, the place you know\nbetter than anywhere else. And so I and teams of others are armed with Q-tips and tweezers and advanced DNA techniques to uncover the microscopic\nlife nearest us. In doing so, we found\nover 600 species of bugs that live in USA homes, everything from spiders and cockroaches to tiny mites that cling to feathers. And we found over 100,000 species\nof bacteria and fungi that live in our dust bunnies, thousands more that live\non our clothes or in our showers. We've gone further still, and we looked at the microorganisms that live inside the bodies\nof each of those bugs in our home. In each bug, for example, a wasp, we see a microscopic jungle\nunfold in a petri plate, a world of hundreds of vibrant species. Behold the biological cosmos! So many of the species\nyou're looking at right now don't yet have names. Most of the life around us\nremains unknown. I remember the first time I discovered\nand got to name a new species. It was a fungus that lives\nin the nest of a paper wasp. It's white and fluffy, and I named it \"mucor nidicola,\" meaning in Latin that it lives\nin the nest of another. This is a picture of it\ngrowing on a dinosaur, because everyone\nthinks dinosaurs are cool. At the time, I was in graduate school, and I was so excited\nthat I had found this new life form. I called up my dad, and I go, \"Dad! I just discovered\na new microorganism species.\" And he laughed and he goes, \"That's great. I hope you also\ndiscovered a cure for it.\" (Laughter) \"Cure it.\" Now, my dad is my biggest fan, so in that crushing moment where he wanted\nto kill my new little life form, I realized that actually I had failed him, both as a daughter and a scientist. In my years toiling away in labs\nand in people's backyards, investigating and cataloging\nthe microscopic life around us, I'd never made clear\nmy true mission to him. My goal is not to find technology to kill the new microscopic\nlife around us. My goal is to find new technology\nfrom this life, that will help save us. The diversity of life in our homes is more\nthan a list of 100,000 new species. It is 100,000 new sources\nof solutions to human problems. I know it's hard to believe\nthat anything that's so small or only has one cell can do anything powerful, but they can. These creatures\nare microscopic alchemists, with the ability to transform\ntheir environment with an arsenal of chemical tools. This means that they can live\nanywhere on this planet, and they can eat whatever\nfood is around them. This means they can eat everything\nfrom toxic waste to plastic, and they can produce waste products\nlike oil and battery power and even tiny nuggets of real gold. They can transform the inedible\ninto nutritive. They can make sugar into alcohol. They give chocolate its flavor, and soil the power to grow. I'm here to tell you that the next 100 years will feature\nthese microscopic creatures solving more of our problems. And we have a lot of problems\nto choose from. We've got the mundane:\nbad-smelling clothes or bland food. And we've got the monumental: disease, pollution, war. And so this is my mission: to not just catalog\nthe microscopic life around us, but to find out what it's uniquely\nwell-suited to help us with. Here's an example. We started with a pest, a wasp that lives on many of our homes. Inside that wasp, we plucked out\na little-known microorganism species with a unique ability: it could make beer. This is a trait that only\na few species on this planet have. In fact, all commercially produced\nbeer you've ever had likely came from one of only\nthree microorganism species. Yet our species, it could make\na beer that tasted like honey, and it could also make\na delightfully tart beer. In fact, this microorganism species\nthat lives in the belly of a wasp, it could make a valuable sour beer better than any other species\non this planet. There are now four species\nthat produce commercial beer. Where you used to see a pest, now think of tasting\nyour future favorite beer. As a second example, I worked with researchers\nto dig in the dirt in people's backyards. There, we uncovered a microorganism\nthat could make novel antibiotics, antibiotics that can kill\nthe world's worst superbugs. This was an awesome thing to find, but here's the secret: for the last 60 years, most of the antibiotics on the market have come from similar soil bacteria. Every day, you and I\nand everyone in this room and on this planet, are saved by similar soil bacteria\nthat produce most of our antibiotics. Where you used to see dirt, now think of medication. Perhaps my favorite example\ncomes from colleagues who are studying\na pond scum microorganism, which is tragically named after\nthe cow dung it was first found in. It's pretty unremarkable\nand would be unworthy of discussion, except that the researchers found\nthat if you feed it to mice, it vaccinates against PTSD. It vaccinates against fear. Where you used to see pond scum,\nnow think of hope. There are so many more microbial examples that I don't have time\nto talk about today. I gave you examples of solutions\nthat came from just three species, but imagine what those other\n100,000 species in your dust bunnies might be able to do. In the future, they might be able\nto make you sexier or smarter or perhaps live longer. So I want you to look\nat your finger again. Think about all those\nmicroscopic creatures that are unknown. Think about in the future\nwhat they might be able to do or make or whose life they might be able to save. How does your finger feel right now? A little bit powerful? That's because you're feeling the future. Thank you.

Her name was Enheduanna. She was the high priestess of the moon god\nand history’s first known author. By the time of her exile, she had written \n42 hymns and three epic poems— and Sumer hadn’t heard the last of her. Enheduanna lived 1,700 years \nbefore Sappho, 1,500 years before Homer, and about 500 years before \nthe biblical patriarch Abraham. She was born in Mesopotamia, the land \nbetween the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and the birthplace of the first cities \nand high cultures. Her father was King Sargon the Great, \nhistory’s first empire builder, who conquered the independent city-states \nof Mesopotamia under a unified banner. Sargon was a northern Semite \nwho spoke Akkadian, and the older Sumerian cities in the south\nviewed him as a foreign invader. They frequently revolted to regain \ntheir independence, fracturing his new dynasty. To bridge the gap between cultures, Sargon appointed his only daughter, \nEnheduanna, as high priestess in the empire’s most important temple. Female royalty traditionally \nserved religious roles, and she was educated to read \nand write in both Sumerian and Akkadian, and make mathematical calculations. The world's first writing started in Sumer\nas a system of accounting, allowing merchants to communicate \nover long distances with traders abroad. Their pictogram system of record keeping \ndeveloped into a script about 300 years \nbefore Enheduanna’s birth. This early writing style, \ncalled cuneiform, was written with a reed stylus pressed \ninto soft clay to make wedge-shaped marks. But until Enheduanna, this writing mostly took the form \nof record keeping and transcription, rather than original works attributable \nto individual writers. Enheduanna’s Ur was a city \nof 34,000 people with narrow streets, multi-storied brick homes, granaries, \nand irrigation. As high priestess, Enheduanna \nmanaged grain storage for the city, oversaw hundreds of temple workers, \ninterpreted sacred dreams, and presided over the monthly \nnew moon festival and rituals celebrating the equinoxes. Enheduanna set about unifying \nthe older Sumerian culture with the newer Akkadian civilization. To accomplish this, \nshe wrote 42 religious hymns that combined both mythologies. Each Mesopotamian city \nwas ruled by a patron deity, so her hymns were dedicated \nto the ruling god of each major city. She praised the city’s temple, \nglorified the god’s attributes, and explained the god’s relationship \nto other deities within the pantheon. In her writing, \nshe humanized the once aloof gods— now they suffered, fought, loved, \nand responded to human pleading. Enheduanna’s most valuable \nliterary contribution was the poetry she wrote to Inanna, \ngoddess of war and desire, the divinely chaotic energy \nthat gives spark to the universe. Inanna delighted in all forms \nof sexual expression and was considered so powerful that \nshe transcended gender boundaries, as did her earthly attendants, who could \nbe prostitutes, eunuchs or cross-dressers. Enheduanna placed Inanna at the top of \nthe pantheon as the most powerful deity. Her odes to Inanna mark the first time \nan author writes using the pronoun “I,” and the first time writing is used \nto explore deep, private emotions. After the death of Enheduanna’s father, \nKing Sargon, a general took advantage \nof the power vacuum and staged a coup. As a powerful member of the ruling family,\nEnheduanna was a target, and the general exiled her from Ur. Her nephew, \nthe legendary Sumerian king Naram-Sin, ultimately crushed the uprising \nand restored his aunt as high priestess. In total, Enheduanna served \nas high priestess for 40 years. After her death, \nshe became a minor deity, and her poetry was copied, studied, \nand performed throughout the empire for over 500 years. Her poems influenced \nthe Hebrew Old Testament, the epics of Homer, and Christian hymns. Today, Enheduanna’s legacy still exists, on clay tablets that have \nstood the test of time."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Writing was first invented for what purpose?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To record history"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To write poetry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To help merchants keep business records"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To send letters to family far away"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "As high priestess, Enheduanna had many responsibilities to the citizens of Ur.

Yar Khan", "category": "Motivation and Emotion", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-beautiful-balance-between-courage-and-fear-cara-e-yar-khan", "transcript": {"en": "When we're young, we're innocently brave, and we fearlessly dream\nabout what our lives might be like. Maybe you wanted to be an astronaut\nor a rocket scientist. Maybe you dreamed\nof traveling to every continent. Since I was very young, I dreamed of working\nfor the United Nations in some of the most difficult\ncountries in the world. And thanks to a lot of courage that dream came true. But here's the thing about courage: it doesn't just appear\nwhenever we need it. It's the result of tough\nreflection and real work, involving the balance\nbetween fear and bravery. Without fear, we'll do foolish things. And without courage,\nwe'll never step into the unknown. The balance of the two\nis where the magic lies, and it's a balance\nwe all deal with every day. First, a word about my fancy wheels. I haven't always used a wheelchair. I grew up like many of you, running, jumping and dancing. I love to dance. However, in my mid-twenties, I began to experience\na series of inexplicable falls. And a few years later, I was diagnosed with a recessive\ngenetic condition called hereditary inclusion body myopathy, or HIBM. It's a progressive muscle wasting disease that affects all of my muscles\nfrom head to toe. HIBM is very rare. In the United States there are\nless than 200 people diagnosed. To date, there is\nno proved treatment or cure, and within 10 to 15 years of its onset, HIBM typically leads to quadriplegia, which is why I now use a wheelchair. When I was first diagnosed,\neverything changed. It was frightening news because I had no experience\nwith chronic illness or disabilities. And I had no idea\nhow the disease might progress. But what was most disheartening was to listen to other people advise me to limit my ambitions and dreams, and to change my expectations\nof what to expect from life. \"You should quit\nyour international career.\" \"No one will marry you this way.\" \"You would be selfish to have children.\" The fact that someone who wasn't me was putting limitations\non my dreams and ambitions was preposterous. And unacceptable. So I ignored them. (Cheers and applause) I did get married. And I decided for myself\nnot to have children. And I continued my career\nwith the United Nations after my diagnosis, going to work for two years in Angola, a country recovering\nfrom 27 years of brutal civil war. However, it would be another five years until I officially declared\nmy diagnosis to my employer. Because I was afraid that they would question my capacity\nto manage and I'd lose my job. I was working in countries\nwhere polio had been common, so when I overheard someone say that they thought\nI might have survived polio, I thought my secret was safe. No one asked why I was limping. So I didn't say anything. It took me over a decade to internalize the severity of HIBM, even as basic tasks and functions\nbecame increasingly difficult. Yet, I continued to pursue my dream\nof working all over the world, and was even appointed\nas a disability focal point for UNICEF in Haiti, where I served for two years\nafter the devastating 2010 earthquake. And then my work brought me\nto the United States. And even as the disease\nprogressed significantly and I needed leg braces\nand a walker to get around, I still longed for adventure. And this time, I started dreaming\nof a grand outdoor adventure. And what's more grand\nthan the Grand Canyon? Did you know that for every\nfive million people who visit the Rim only one percent go down\nto the canyon's base? I wanted to be a part of that one percent. The only thing is -- (Applause) The only thing is that the Grand Canyon\nisn't exactly accessible. I was going to need some assistance to get down the 5,000-foot descent\nof vertical loose terrain. Now, when I face obstacles, fear doesn't necessarily\nimmediately set in because I assume that one way or another, I'll figure it out. And in this case, my thought was, well, if I can't walk down, I could learn to ride a horse. So that's what I did. And with that fateful decision began a four-year commitment, tossing back and forth\nbetween fear and courage to undertake a 12-day expedition. Four days on horseback\nto cross Grand Canyon rim to rim, and eight days rafting\n150 miles of the Colorado River, all with a film crew in tow. Spoiler alert -- we made it. But not without showing me\nhow my deepest fear can somehow manifest\na mirror response of equal courage. On April 13, 2018, sitting eight feet above the ground, riding a mustang horse named Sheriff, my first impression of Grand Canyon was one of shock and terror. Who knew I had a fear of heights. (Laughter) But there was no giving up now. I mustered up every ounce\nof courage inside me to not let my fear get the best of me. Embarking on the South Rim, all I could do to keep myself composed was to breathe deeply,\nstare up into the clouds and focus on my team's voices. But then, in the first hour,\ndisaster struck. Unable to hold myself\nupright in the saddle, going down an oversized step, I flung forward and smacked my face\non the back of the horse's head. There was panic, my head hurt fiercely, but the path was too narrow\nfor us to dismount. Only at the halfway point at 2,300 feet, at least another two hours down, could we stop and remove my helmet and see the egg-sized bump\nprotruding from my forehead. For all of that planning and gear, how is it that we didn't\neven have an ice pack? (Laughter) Luckily for all of us,\nthe swelling came outwards, and would drain into my face\nas two fantastic black eyes which is an amazing way to look\nin a documentary film. (Laughter) (Applause and cheers) This was not an easy, peaceful journey, and yet, that was exactly the point. Even though I was afraid\nto get back into the saddle, I got back in. The descent alone to the canyon floor took a total of 10 hours and that was just day one of four riding. Next came the mighty rapids. The Colorado River in the Grand Canyon has some of the highest\nwhite water in the country. And just to be prepared\nin case we should capsize, we'd practice having me swim\nthrough a smaller rapid. And it's safe to say it wasn't glamorous. (Laughter) I took my breath\nin the wrong part of the wave, choked on river water and was unable to steer myself. Yes, it was scary, but it was also fantastic. Waterfalls, slick canyons and a couple billion years of bedrock that seemed to change color\nthroughout the day. The Grand Canyon is true wilderness and worthy of all of its accolades. (Applause) The expedition, all that planning and the trip itself, showed me a level of fear\nI had never experienced before. But more importantly, it showed me how boldly\ncourageous I can be. My Grand Canyon journey was not easy. This was not a vision\nof an Amazonian woman effortlessly making her way\nthrough epic scenery. This was me crying, exhausted and beat up with two black eyes. It was scary, it was stressful, it was exhilarating. Now that the trip is over, it's easy to be blasé\nabout what we achieved. I know I want to raft the river again. This time, all 277 miles of it. (Applause) But I also know that I would never do\nthe horseback-riding part again. (Laughter) It's just too dangerous. And that's my real point. I'm not just here\nto show you my film footage. I'm here to remind us all that life is really just a lesson in finding the balance\nbetween fear and courage. And understanding what is\nand what isn't a good idea. (Laughter) Life is already scary, so for our dreams to come true,\nwe need to be brave. In facing my fears and finding the courage\nto push through them, I swear my life has been extraordinary. So live big and try to let your courage\noutweigh your fear. You never know where it might take you. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

It spoke of a fantastical realm, containing the Tower of Babel \nand the Fountain of Youth— all ruled over by the letter’s \nmysterious author: Prester John. Today, we know that this extraordinary\nking never existed. But the legend of this mythical kingdom \nand its powerful ruler would impact the decisions of European\nleaders for the next 400 years. Prester John’s myth would propel \nthe age of exploration, inspire intercontinental diplomacy, \nand indirectly begin a civil war. When Prester John’s letter appeared, \nEurope was embroiled in the Crusades. In this series of religious wars, Europeans campaigned to seize what \nthey regarded as the Christian Holy Land. The Church vilified any faith \noutside of Christianity, including that of the Jewish and Muslim \ncommunities populating the region. Crusaders were eager to find Christian\nkingdoms to serve as allies in their war. And they were particularly interested\nin rumors of a powerful Christian king who had defeated an enormous \nMuslim army in the Far East. In fact, it was a Mongol horde including\nconverted Christian tribes that had routed the army. But news of this victory \ntraveled unreliably. Merchants and emissaries filled \ngaps in the story with epic poems and Biblical fragments. By the time the story reached Europe, the Mongol horde had been replaced\nwith a great Christian army, commanded by a king who shared \nthe Crusader’s vision of marching on Jerusalem. And when a letter allegedly written by \nthis so-called “Prester John” appeared, European rulers were thrilled. While the letter’s actual author \nremains unknown, its stereotypes about the East \nand alignment with European goals indicate it was a Western forgery. But despite the letter’s obvious origins \nas European propaganda, the appeal of Prester John’s myth \nwas too great for the Crusaders to ignore. Before long, European mapmakers were guessing \nthe location of his mythical kingdom. In the 13th and 14th centuries, \nEuropean missionaries went East, along the newly revived Silk Road. They weren’t searching for \nthe letter’s author, who would have been over a century old; \nbut rather, for his descendants. The title of Prester John \nwas briefly identified with several Central Asian rulers, but it soon became clear that the Mongols\nwere largely non-Christian. And as their Empire began to decline, Europeans began pursuing alternate routes \nto the Far East, and new clues to Prester John’s location. At the same time these explorers \nwent south, Ethiopian pilgrims began traveling north. In Rome, these visitors \nquickly attracted the interest of European scholars and cartographers. Since Ethiopia had been converted \nto Christianity in the 4th century, the stories of their African homeland \nfit perfectly into Prester John’s legend. Portuguese explorers scoured Africa \nfor the kingdom, until a mix of confusion and diplomacy \nfinally turned myth into reality. The Ethiopians graciously received \ntheir European guests, who were eager to do business \nwith the ruler they believed to be Prester John. Though the Ethiopians were initially \nconfused by the Portuguese’s unusual name for their Emperor, they were savvy enough to recognize \nthe diplomatic capital it afforded them. The Ethiopian diplomats played the part \nof Prester John’s subjects, and the Portuguese triumphantly announced\nan alliance with the fabled sovereign— over 350 years after the European \nletter had begun the search. But this long-awaited partnership \nwas quickly tested. A decade later, the Sultanate of Adal, a regional power supported \nby the Ottoman Empire, invaded Ethiopia. The Portuguese sent troops that helped \nEthiopians win this conflict. But by this time, it was clear that Ethiopia was not \nthe powerful ally Europe had hoped. Worse still, the increasingly intolerant \nRoman Catholic Church now deemed the Ethiopian sect \nof Christianity heretical. Their subsequent attempts to convert \nthe people they once revered as ideal Christians would eventually spark a civil war, and in the 1630s, \nEthiopia cut ties with Europe. Over the next two centuries, the legend of Prester John \nslowly faded into oblivion— ending the reign of a king who made \nhistory despite having never existed."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Textual analysis of the Letter of Prester John indicates that it is likely to have been authored by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prester John"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An Asian ruler"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A European"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An Arab"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "During the Middle Ages and the Early Modern era, Prester John was believed to be located in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Central Asia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Africa"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Far East"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Europeans believed Prester John could help them:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Defeat the Mongols"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Retake Jerusalem"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Explore the Atlantic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cross the Sahara"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which European country claimed to have found Prester John in Africa?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Portugal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Spain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "France"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following events contributed to the European identification of Prester John with Africa?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Columbus’s voyages of exploration"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Ottoman conquest of the Arab world"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The arrival of Ethiopians in Europe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Atlantic slave trade"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 15, "lesson": 18, "title": "Your brain hallucinates your conscious reality - Anil Seth", "category": "Consciousness, Sensation and Perception", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/your-brain-hallucinates-your-conscious-reality-anil-seth", "transcript": {"en": "Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life,\nI ceased to exist. I was having a small operation,\nand my brain was filling with anesthetic. I remember a sense\nof detachment and falling apart and a coldness. And then I was back,\ndrowsy and disoriented, but definitely there. Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time\nor anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense\nof time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. Coming round from\nanesthesia is very different. I could have been under\nfor five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. It was total oblivion. Anesthesia --\nit's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining\nmysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity\nof many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience\nright here and right now. How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness\nfor each of us is all there is. Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all. And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through\nmental illness or pain. And if we can experience\njoy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too? Do they also have a sense of self? And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point,\nmaybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops\na sense of its own existence. I actually think the prospects\nfor a conscious AI are pretty remote. And I think this because\nmy research is telling me that consciousness has less to do\nwith pure intelligence and more to do with our nature\nas living and breathing organisms. Consciousness and intelligence\nare very different things. You don't have to be smart to suffer,\nbut you probably do have to be alive. In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences\nof the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through\nand because of our living bodies. Now, you might have heard\nthat we know nothing about how the brain and body\ngive rise to consciousness. Some people even say it's beyond\nthe reach of science altogether. But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion\nof scientific work in this area. If you come to my lab\nat the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists\nfrom all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers. All of us together trying to understand\nhow consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong. And the strategy is very simple. I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've\ncome to think about life. At one time, people thought\nthe property of being alive could not be explained\nby physics and chemistry -- that life had to be\nmore than just mechanism. But people no longer think that. As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties\nof living systems in terms of physics and chemistry -- things like metabolism,\nreproduction, homeostasis -- the basic mystery of what life is\nstarted to fade away, and people didn't propose\nany more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital. So as with life, so with consciousness. Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening\ninside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery\nof what consciousness is should start to fade away. At least that's the plan. So let's get started. What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science\nof consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think\nof consciousness in two different ways. There are experiences\nof the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic,\n3D, fully immersive inner movie. And then there's conscious self. The specific experience\nof being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness\nwe all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences\nof the world around us, and with the important idea\nof the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure\nwhat's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.\nThere's no sound either. All you've got to go on\nis streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related\nto things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --\nfiguring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines\nthese sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs\nabout the way the world is to form its best guess\nof what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess\nof what's out there in the world. Let me give you a couple\nof examples of all this. You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think\nabout it in a new way. If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be\nvery different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact\nexactly the same shade. And I can illustrate this. If I put up a second version\nof the image here and join the two patches\nwith a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference. It's exactly the same shade of gray. And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across\nand join them up. It's a single colored block of gray,\nthere's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,\nand it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain\nis using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits\nof the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims\nthe appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter\nthan it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly\nthe brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again\nand see if you can get anything. (Distorted voice) Still strange. Now listen to this. (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit\nis a really terrible idea. (Laughter) Which I do. So you heard some words there, right? Now listen to the first sound again.\nI'm just going to replay it. (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there. Once more for luck. (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory\ninformation coming into the brain hasn't changed at all. All that's changed\nis your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information. And that changes\nwhat you consciously hear. All this puts the brain\nbasis of perception in a bit of a different light. Instead of perception depending largely\non signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions\nflowing in the opposite direction. We don't just passively\nperceive the world, we actively generate it. The world we experience\ncomes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in. Let me give you\none more example of perception as this active, constructive process. Here we've combined immersive\nvirtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects\nof overly strong perceptual predictions on experience. In this panoramic video,\nwe've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground. We've processed the footage using\nan algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects\nof overly strong perceptual predictions. In this case, to see dogs. And you can see\nthis is a very strange thing. When perceptual\npredictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much\nlike the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis. Now, think about this for a minute. If hallucination is a kind\nof uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now\nis also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions\nare being reined in by sensory information from the world. In fact, we're all\nhallucinating all the time, including right now. It's just that when we agree\nabout our hallucinations, we call that reality. (Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you\nthat your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination\ngenerated by the brain. This seems a very strange idea, right? Yes, visual illusions\nmight deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived\nabout what it means to be me? For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified\nand so continuous that it's difficult\nnot to take it for granted. But we shouldn't take it for granted. There are in fact many different ways\nwe experience being a self. There's the experience of having a body and of being a body. There are experiences\nof perceiving the world from a first person point of view. There are experiences\nof intending to do things and of being the cause of things\nthat happen in the world. And there are experiences of being a continuous\nand distinctive person over time, built from a rich set\nof memories and social interactions. Many experiments show, and psychiatrists\nand neurologists know very well, that these different ways\nin which we experience being a self can all come apart. What this means is\nthe basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather\nfragile construction of the brain. Another experience,\nwhich just like all others, requires explanation. So let's return to the bodily self. How does the brain generate\nthe experience of being a body and of having a body? Well, just the same principles apply. The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not\npart of its body. And there's a beautiful experiment\nin neuroscience to illustrate this. And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home. All you need is one of these. (Laughter) And a couple of paintbrushes. In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand\nis placed in front of them. Then both hands are simultaneously\nstroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand. Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand\nis in fact part of their body. And the idea is that the congruence\nbetween seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand\nand is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain\nto make its best guess that the fake hand\nis in fact part of the body. (Laughter) So you can measure\nall kinds of clever things. You can measure skin conductance\nand startle responses, but there's no need. It's clear the guy in blue\nhas assimilated the fake hand. This means that even experiences\nof what our body is is a kind of best guessing -- a kind of controlled\nhallucination by the brain. There's one more thing. We don't just experience our bodies\nas objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within. We all experience the sense\nof being a body from the inside. And sensory signals\ncoming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain\nabout the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing,\nwhat the blood pressure is like, lots of things. This kind of perception,\nwhich we call interoception, is rather overlooked. But it's critically important because perception and regulation\nof the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive. Here's another version\nof the rubber hand illusion. This is from our lab at Sussex. And here, people see\na virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time\nwith their heartbeat. And when it's flashing\nin time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense\nthat it's in fact part of their body. So experiences of having a body\nare deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within. There's one last thing\nI want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body\nfrom the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me,\nthe world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it\nas an object from the outside. But my experiences\nof the body from within, they're not like that at all. I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere. I don't perceive my insides as objects. In fact, I don't experience them\nmuch at all unless they go wrong. And this is important, I think. Perception of the internal\nstate of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables\nwithin the tight bounds that are compatible with survival. When the brain uses predictions\nto figure out what's there, we perceive objects\nas the causes of sensations. When the brain uses predictions\nto control and regulate things, we experience how well\nor how badly that control is going. So our most basic experiences\nof being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological\nmechanisms that keep us alive. And when we follow this idea\nall the way through, we can start to see\nthat all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same\nmechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic\ndrive to stay alive. We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of\nour living bodies. Let me bring things together step-by-step. What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess\nof what's out there. Our experienced world\ncomes from the inside out, not just the outside in. The rubber hand illusion shows\nthat this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body. And these self-related predictions\ndepend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body. And finally, experiences of being an embodied self\nare more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there. So our experiences of the world\naround us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds\nof controlled hallucinations that have been shaped\nover millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds\nfull of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence. Now, I leave you with three\nimplications of all this. First, just as we can\nmisperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms\nof prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new\nopportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally\nget at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like\ndepression and schizophrenia. Second: what it means to be me\ncannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences\nare shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms\nthat keep us alive. Just making computers smarter\nis not going to make them sentient. Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible\nway of being conscious. And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space\nof possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds\nare unique to each of us, but they're all grounded\nin biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures. Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science,\nfrom Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day. With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of\nand not apart from the rest of nature. And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Thank you.

The writer blamed their deaths \non a pesticide called DDT that exterminators had sprayed \non a nearby marsh. The letter was the push \nCarson needed to investigate DDT. She had already heard from scientists \nand conservationists who were worried that rampant use of the pesticide \nposed a threat to fish, birds, and possibly humans. She began to make inquiries \nthrough government contacts from her years working \nin the United States Bureau of Fisheries. She asked: “what has already silenced \nthe voices of spring?” In 1962, Carson published her findings \nin \"Silent Spring.\" Her book documented \nthe misuse of chemicals and their toll on nature \nand human health. \"Silent Spring\" immediately drew both \napplause and impassioned dissent— along with vicious personal attacks \non the author. How did this mild-mannered biologist \nand writer ignite such controversy? Carson began her career \nas a hardworking graduate student, balancing her studies in biology \nat John Hopkins University with part time jobs. Still, she had to leave school \nbefore completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing father \nand sister. Carson found part time work \nwith the Bureau of Fisheries writing for a radio program \non marine biology. Her ability to write materials that could \nhold the general public’s attention impressed her superiors, \nand in 1936, she became the second woman \nto be hired at the Bureau full time. In 1941, she published \nthe first of three books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations\non underwater worlds. These explorations resonated \nwith a wide audience. In \"Silent Spring,\" \nCarson turned her attention to the ways human actions \nthreaten the balance of nature. DDT was originally used during \nWorld War II to shield crops from insects and protect soldiers \nfrom insect-borne diseases. After the war, it was routinely sprayed \nin wide swaths to fight pests, often with unforeseen results. One attempt to eradicate fire ants \nin the southern U.S. killed wildlife indiscriminately,\nbut did little to eliminate the ants. In spite of this and other mishaps, \nthe US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies \nextolled the benefits of DDT. There was little regulation or public \nawareness about its potential harm. But Carson showed how \nthe overuse of chemicals led to the evolution \nof resistant species— which, in turn, encouraged the development\nof deadlier chemicals. Since DDT does not dissolve in water, she asserted that over time \nit would accumulate in the environment, the bodies of insects, the tissues \nof animals who consume those insects, and eventually humans. She suggested that exposure to DDT \nmight alter the structure of genes, with unknown consequences \nfor future generations. The response to \"Silent Spring\" \nwas explosive. For many people the book \nwas a call to regulate substances capable of catastrophic harm. Others objected that Carson \nhadn’t mentioned DDT’s role controlling the threat insects \nposed to human health. Former Secretary of Agriculture \nEzra Taft Benson demanded to know “why a spinster with no children \nwas so concerned about genetics?” and dismissed Carson \nas “probably a Communist.” A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer \nalluded to Carson and her supporters as “sinister influences” \naiming to paint businesses as “immoral.” In reality, Carson had focused \non the dangers of chemicals because they weren’t widely understood, \nwhile the merits were well publicized. She rejected the prevailing belief \nthat humans should and could control nature. Instead, she challenged people \nto cultivate “maturity and mastery, not of nature, \nbut of ourselves.” Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after \nthe publication of \"Silent Spring.\" Her work galvanized a generation \nof environmental activists. In 1969, under pressure \nfrom environmentalists, Congress passed \nthe National Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate\nenvironmental impacts of their actions. To enforce the act, President Richard Nixon created \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. And in 1972, the EPA issued \na partial ban on the use of DDT.

We use them to cure infectious diseases, but also to safely facilitate everything \nfrom surgery to chemotherapy to organ transplants. Without antibiotics, even routine medical procedures \ncan lead to life-threatening infections. And we’re at risk of losing them. Antibiotics are chemicals \nthat prevent the growth of bacteria. Unfortunately, some bacteria \nhave become resistant to all currently available antibiotics. At the same time, \nwe’ve stopped discovering new ones. Still, there’s hope that we can get ahead \nof the problem. But first, how did we \nget into this situation? The first widely used antibiotic \nwas penicillin, discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. In his 1945 Nobel Prize \nacceptance speech, Fleming warned that bacterial resistance \nhad the potential to ruin the miracle of antibiotics. He was right: in the 1940s and 50s, resistant bacteria \nalready began to appear. From then until the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies \ncountered the problem of resistance by discovering many new antibiotics. At first this was a highly successful— \nand highly profitable— enterprise. Over time, a couple things changed. Newly discovered antibiotics \nwere often only effective for a narrow spectrum of infections, whereas the first ones \nhad been broadly applicable. This isn’t a problem in itself, but it does mean that fewer doses \nof these drugs could be sold— making them less profitable. In the early days, \nantibiotics were heavily overprescribed, including for viral infections \nthey had no effect on. Scrutiny around prescriptions increased, \nwhich is good, but also lowered sales. At the same time, \ncompanies began to develop more drugs that are taken over a patient’s lifetime, like blood pressure \nand cholesterol medications, and later anti-depressants \nand anti-anxiety medications. Because they are taken indefinitely, \nthese drugs more profitable. By the mid-1980s, no new chemical classes \nof antibiotics were discovered. But bacteria continued to acquire \nresistance and pass it along by sharing genetic information \nbetween individual bacteria and even across species. Now bacteria that are resistant \nto many antibiotics are common, and increasingly some strains \nare resistant to all our current drugs. So, what can we do about this? We need to control the use \nof existing antibiotics, create new ones, combat resistance to new \nand existing drugs, and find new ways to fight \nbacterial infections. The largest consumer \nof antibiotics is agriculture, which uses antibiotics not only \nto treat infections but to promote the growth of food animals. Using large volumes of antibiotics increases the bacteria’s exposure \nto the antibiotics and therefore their opportunity \nto develop resistance. Many bacteria that are common in animals, \nlike salmonella, can also infect humans, and drug-resistant versions can pass \nto us through the food chain and spread through international trade \nand travel networks. In terms of finding new antibiotics, nature offers the most promising \nnew compounds. Organisms like other microbes and fungi \nhave evolved over millions of years to live in competitive environments— meaning they often contain \nantibiotic compounds to give them a survival advantage \nover certain bacteria. We can also package antibiotics \nwith molecules that inhibit resistance. One way bacteria develop resistance \nis through proteins of their own that degrade the drug. By packaging the antibiotic with molecules\nthat block the degraders, the antibiotic can do its job. Phages, viruses that attack bacteria \nbut don’t affect humans, are one promising new avenue \nto combat bacterial infections. Developing vaccines for common infections,\nmeanwhile, can help prevent disease \nin the first place. The biggest challenge to all \nthese approaches is funding, which is woefully inadequate \nacross the globe. Antibiotics are so unprofitable \nthat many large pharmaceutical companies have stopped trying to develop them. Meanwhile, smaller companies \nthat successfully bring new antibiotics to market often still go bankrupt, \nlike the American start up Achaogen. New therapeutic techniques \nlike phages and vaccines face the same fundamental problem \nas traditional antibiotics: if they’re working well, \nthey’re used just once, which makes it difficult to make money. And to successfully counteract resistance \nin the long term, we’ll need to use \nnew antibiotics sparingly— lowering the profits \nfor their creators even further. One possible solution is to shift profits \naway from the volume of antibiotics sold. For example, the United Kingdom \nis testing a model where healthcare providers \npurchase antibiotic subscriptions. While governments are looking for ways \nto incentivize antibiotic development, these programs are still \nin the early stages. Countries around the world \nwill need to do much more— but with enough investment \nin antibiotic development and controlled use of our current drugs, we can still get ahead of resistance."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Antibiotics are used for all of the following, except:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Organ Transplant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Organ Implants"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chemotherapy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Killing viruses"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "True or False: many bacteria are resistant to all currently available antibiotics", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Discovered in 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered the first widely used antibiotic,", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Penicillin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Macrolides"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Aminoglycosides"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cephalosporins"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not an effective way to battle antibiotic resistance:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Control the use of antibiotics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Create new antibiotics"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prescribe antibiotics for viral infections"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Combat resistance to antibiotics"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The largest consumer for antibiotic resistance is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Local hospitals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Agriculture"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Senior centers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Educational institutions"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

I thought it was just like a saying, but it actually exists, I guess. There's, like, academic papers about it. And I'm a designer. I don't like unintended consequences. People hire me because they have\nconsequences that they really intend, and what they intend is for me\nto help them achieve those consequences. So I live in fear\nof unintended consequences. And so this is a story about\nconsequences intended and unintended. I got called by an organization\ncalled Robin Hood to do a favor for them. Robin Hood is based in New York,\na wonderful philanthropic organization that does what it says in the name. They take from rich people,\ngive it to poor people. In this case, what they wanted to benefit\nwas the New York City school system, a huge enterprise that educates\nmore than a million students at a time, and in buildings that are like this one, old buildings, big buildings, drafty buildings, sometimes buildings\nthat are in disrepair, certainly buildings\nthat could use a renovation. Robin Hood had this ambition\nto improve these buildings in some way, but what they realized was to fix the buildings would be\ntoo expensive and impractical. So instead they tried to figure out\nwhat one room they could go into in each of these buildings,\nin as many buildings that they could, and fix that one room so that they could improve\nthe lives of the children inside as they were studying. And what they came up with\nwas the school library, and they came up with this idea\ncalled the Library Initiative. All the students\nhave to pass through the library. That's where the books are. That's where the heart\nand soul of the school is. So let's fix these libraries. So they did this wonderful thing\nwhere they brought in first 10, then 20, then more architects, each one of whom was assigned a library\nto rethink what a library was. They trained special librarians. So they started this mighty enterprise to reform public schools\nby improving these libraries. Then they called me up and they said,\n\"Could you make a little contribution?\" I said, \"Sure, what do you want me to do?\" And they said, \"Well, we want you\nto be the graphic designer in charge of the whole thing.\" And so I thought, I know what that means.\nThat means I get to design a logo. I know how to design that. I design logos. That's what people come to me for. So OK, let's design a logo for this thing. Easy to do, actually,\ncompared with architecture and being a librarian. Just do a logo, make a contribution,\nand then you're out, and you feel really good about yourself. And I'm a great guy and I like to feel\ngood about myself when I do these favors. So I thought, let's overdeliver. I'm going to give you three logos,\nall based on this one idea. So you have three options,\npick any of the three. They're all great, I said. So the basic idea was\nthese would be new school libraries for New York schools, and so the idea is that it's a new thing,\na new idea that needs a new name. What I wanted to do was dispel the idea\nthat these were musty old libraries, the kind of places\nthat everyone is bored with, you know, not your grandparents' library. Don't worry about that at all. This is going to this new, exciting thing, not a boring library. So option number one: so instead of thinking of it as a library, think of it as a place where it is like:\ndo talk, do make loud noises. Right? So no shushing,\nit's like a shush-free zone. We're going to call it the Reading Room. That was option number one.\nOK, option number two. Option number two was, wait for it, OWL. I'll meet you at OWL. I'm getting my book from the OWL.\nMeet you after school down at OWL. I like that, right?\nNow, what does OWL stand for? Well, it could be One World Library, or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn. Or it could be -- and I figure librarians\ncould figure out other things it could be because they know about words. So other things, right? And then look at this.\nIt's like the eye of the owl. This is irresistible in my opinion. But there's even another idea. Option number three. Option number three\nwas based actually on language. It's the idea that \"read\"\nis the past tense of \"read,\" and they're both spelled the same way. So why don't we call\nthis place The Red Zone? I'll meet you at the Red Zone. Are you Red? Get Red. I'm well Red. (Laughter) I really loved this idea, and I somehow was not focused on the idea that librarians as a class are sort of\ninterested in spelling and I don't know. (Laughter) But sometimes cleverness\nis more important than spelling, and I thought this would be\none of those instances. So usually when I make these presentations I say there's just one question\nand the question should be, \"How can I thank you, Mike?\" But in this case,\nthe question was more like, \"Um, are you kidding?\" Because, they said, the premise of all this work was that kids were bored\nwith old libraries, musty old libraries. They were tired of them. And instead, they said, these kids\nhave never really seen a library. The school libraries in these schools are really so dilapidated,\nif they're there at all, that they haven't bored anyone. They haven't even been there\nto bore anyone at all. So the idea was, just forget\nabout giving it a new name. Just call it, one last try, a library. Right? OK. So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph? Exclamation point? Then -- this is because I'm clever -- move that into the \"i,\" make it red, and there you have it,\nthe Library Initiative. So I thought, mission accomplished,\nthere's your logo. So what's interesting about this logo,\nan unintended consequence, was that it turned out that\nthey didn't really even need my design because you could type it any font,\nyou could write it by hand, and when they started\nsending emails around, they just would use Shift and 1, they'd get their own logo\njust right out of the thing. And I thought, well, that's fine. Feel free to use that logo. And then I embarked\non the real rollout of this thing -- working with every one of the architects to put this logo on the front door\nof their own library. Right? So here's the big rollout. Basically I'd work\nwith different architects. First Robin Hood was my client.\nNow these architects were my client. I'd say, \"Here's your logo.\nPut it on the door.\" \"Here's your logo. Put it on both doors.\" \"Here's your logo.\nPut it off to the side.\" \"Here's your logo\nrepeated all over to the top.\" So everything was going swimmingly. I just was saying,\n\"Here's your logo. Here's your logo.\" Then I got a call\nfrom one of the architects, a guy named Richard Lewis,\nand he says, \"I've got a problem. You're the graphics guy.\nCan you solve it?\" And I said, OK, sure.\" And he said, \"The problem is\nthat there's a space between the shelf and the ceiling.\" So that sounds like\nan architectural issue to me, not a graphic design issue,\nso I'm, \"Go on.\" And Richard says, \"Well,\nthe top shelf has to be low enough for the kid to reach it, but I'm in a big old building,\nand the ceilings are really high, so actually I've got\nall this space up there and I need something like a mural.\" And I'm like, \"Whoa,\nyou know, I'm a logo designer. I'm not Diego Rivera or something. I'm not a muralist.\" And so he said, \"But can't you\nthink of anything?\" So I said, \"OK, what if we just\ntook pictures of the kids in the school and just put them around\nthe top of the thing, and maybe that could work.\" And my wife is a photographer, and I said, \"Dorothy, there's no budget, can you come to this school\nin east New York, take these pictures?\" And she did, and if you go in Richard's library, which is one of the first that opened, it has this glorious frieze\nof, like, the heroes of the school, oversized, looking down into the little dollhouse\nof the real library, right? And the kids were great,\nhand-selected by the principals and the librarian. It just kind of created\nthis heroic atmosphere in this library, this very dignified setting below\nand the joy of the children above. So naturally all the other librarians\nin the other schools see this and they said, well, we want murals too. And I'm like, OK. So then I think, well,\nit can't be the same mural every time, so Dorothy did another one,\nand then she did another one, but then we needed more help, so I called an illustrator I knew\nnamed Lynn Pauley, and Lynn did these beautiful\npaintings of the kids. Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkin\nat a place called Automatic Design. He did these amazing collages. We had Rafael Esquer do these great silhouettes. He would work with the kids,\nasking for words, and then based on those prompts, come up with this little,\ndelirious kind of constellation of silhouettes\nof things that are in books. Peter Arkle interviewed the kids and had them talk\nabout their favorite books and he put their testimony\nas a frieze up there. Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu and they did this amazing\nmanga-style statement, \"Everyone who is honest is interesting,\" that goes all the way around. Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator, did a whole series of things where he embedded books\ninto the faces and characters and images and places\nthat you find in the books. And then even Maira Kalman did this amazing cryptic installation\nof objects and words that kind of go all around\nand will fascinate students for as long as it's up there. So this was really satisfying, and basically my role here was reading\na series of dimensions to these artists, and I would say, \"Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want. Let me know if you have\nany problem with that.\" And they would go and install these.\nIt just was the greatest thing. But the greatest thing, actually, was -- Every once in a while, I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail\nmade of construction paper, and it would say, \"You are invited\nto the opening of our new library.\" So you'd go to the library,\nsay, you'd go to PS10, and you'd go inside. There'd be balloons,\nthere'd be a student ambassador, there'd be speeches that were read, poetry that was written\nspecifically for the opening, dignitaries would present people\nwith certificates, and the whole thing\nwas just a delirious, fun party. So I loved going to these things. I would stand there dressed like this,\nobviously not belonging, and someone would say,\n\"What are you doing here, mister?\" And I'd say, \"Well, I'm part of the team\nthat designed this place.\" And they'd said, \"You do these shelves?\" And I said, \"No.\"\n\"You took the pictures up above.\" \"No.\" \"Well, what did you do?\" \"You know when you came in?\nThe sign over the door?\" \"The sign that says library?\" (Laughter) \"Yeah, I did that!\" And then they'd sort of go,\n\"OK. Nice work if you can get it.\" So it was so satisfying\ngoing to these little openings despite the fact that I was\nkind of largely ignored or humiliated, but it was actually fun\ngoing to the openings, so I decided that I wanted\nto get the people in my office who had worked on these projects,\nget the illustrators and photographers, and I said, why don't we rent a van and drive around\nthe five boroughs of New York and see how many we could hit at one time. And eventually there were\ngoing to be 60 of these libraries, so we probably got to see\nmaybe half a dozen in one long day. And the best thing of all\nwas meeting these librarians who kind of were running these,\ntook possession of these places like their private stage\nupon which they were invited to mesmerize their students\nand bring the books to life, and it was just\nthis really exciting experience for all of us to actually\nsee these things in action. So we spent a long day doing this and we were in the very last library. It was still winter,\nbecause it got dark early, and the librarian says, \"I'm about to close down.\nSo really nice having you here. Hey, wait a second, do you want to see\nhow I turn off the lights?\" I'm like, \"OK.\" And she said, \"I have\nthis special way that I do it.\" And then she showed me. What she did was she turned out\nevery light one by one by one by one, and the last light she left on was the light that illuminated\nthe kids' faces, and she said, \"That's the last light\nI turn off every night, because I like to remind myself\nwhy I come to work.\" So when I started this whole thing, remember, it was just\nabout designing that logo and being clever, come up with a new name? The unintended consequence here, which I would like to take credit for and like to think I can think through\nthe experience to that extent, but I can't. I was just focused on a foot ahead of me,\nas far as I could reach with my own hands. Instead, way off in the distance was a librarian who was going to find\nthe chain of consequences that we had set in motion, a source of inspiration so that she in this case\ncould do her work really well. 40,000 kids a year\nare affected by these libraries. They've been happening\nfor more than 10 years now, so those librarians have kind of turned on\na generation of children to books and so it's been a thrill to find out that sometimes unintended consequences\nare the best consequences. Thank you very much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

The woman had just given birth \nto their thirteenth child, and the growing family was quickly \nrunning out of food and money. The father walked into the woods \nto ponder their problem. After hours spent wandering \nthrough the trees, he encountered two shadowy silhouettes. The first figure appeared \nto be the man’s God, while the second resembled the Devil. Both figures offered to lighten \nthe man’s burden, and act as Godfather \nto his most recent child. But the man refused their offer— he wouldn’t entrust his son to those \nwho passed judgment on human life. He ventured deeper \ninto the tangled thicket. Here in the darkest part of the woods, \nthe father made out a third figure. Sunken eyes stared out of its gaunt face, \nwhich broke into a crooked smile. This was Death himself, \ncome to offer his services as Godfather. He promised to return \nwhen the child came of age, to bring him happiness and prosperity. The father— knowing that all people \nare equal in the eyes of Death— accepted his offer. Years later, when the child had grown \ninto an ambitious young man, his skeletal Godfather \ncame for his promised visit. In his gnarled hand \nhe held a flask containing the cure for all human ailments. Death had brought this flask \nfor his Godson, promising to make him a successful doctor. But the powerful potion \ncame with very strict rules. If his Godson encountered a sick person and Death was hovering \nat the top of their bed, the doctor could heal them with \njust a waft of the antidote’s fumes. But if Death lingered \nat the foot of the bed, he’d already claimed the patient \nas his own— and the doctor could do nothing for them. In time, the doctor’s potent potion \nand uncanny instincts became known throughout the land. He grew rich and famous, casting off \nthe hardships of his early life. When the king fell ill, he summoned \nthe famous physician to treat him. The doctor swept into the palace, \nready to show off his skills. But when he entered the king’s chamber, he was dismayed to see Death \nsettled at the foot of the bed. The doctor desperately wanted the glory \nof saving the king— even if it meant deceiving his Godfather. And so, he swiftly spun the bed around \nand reversed Death’s position, leaving the doctor free \nto administer the antidote. Death was livid. He warned his arrogant Godson \nthat if he ever cheated Death again, he would pay for it with his life. Death and the doctor \ncontinued their travels. After some time, the king’s messengers \ncame to collect the doctor yet again. The princess was gravely ill, and the king had promised incredible \nriches to anyone who could cure her. The doctor approached the princesses’ \nchamber with gold in his eyes. But upon seeing the sleeping princess, \nhis greed fell away. He was so struck by her grace, that he failed to notice \nDeath lurking by her feet. He swiftly healed the princess, but before she could even utter \nher thanks, Death had dragged \nhis lovesick Godson away. In an instant, \nthe palace dissolved around them. The doctor found himself \nin an immense cave lined with countless quivering candles,\neach representing the duration of a life. As punishment for his Godson’s \nfoolish attempt to master mortality, Death whittled his candle \ndown to its wick. Seeing his own dwindling light, the doctor felt the fear \nhe’d often glimpsed in his patients’ eyes. Desperately, he begged Death to transfer \nhis dying light onto a new candle. His Godfather considered the request— \nbut the doctor’s betrayal was too great. He loosened his bony grip, \nand his Godson’s candle fell to the floor. Death stood motionless, his inscrutable face \nfixed on the sputtering flame— until all that was left of the doctor \nwas a wisp of smoke."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When he wandered into the woods, the poor father met:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "His god, the devil, and sickness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Life, evil, and death"}, {"label": "C", "text": "His god, the devil, and death"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Good and evil"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "2.

Ming Luke", "category": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-s-a-squillo-and-why-do-opera-singers-need-it-ming-luke", "transcript": {"en": "Gripped with vengeful passion, The Queen of the Night \ntears across the stage. She begins to sing her titular aria, one of the most famous sections \nfrom Mozart’s beloved opera, \"The Magic Flute.\" The orchestra fills the hall with music, but the queen’s voice soars above \nthe instruments. Its melody rings out \nacross thousands of patrons, reaching seats 40 meters away— all without any assistance \nfrom a microphone. How is it possible that this single voice\ncan be heard so clearly, above the strains \nof dozens of instruments? The answer lies in the physics \nof the human voice, and the carefully honed technique \nof an expert opera singer. All the music in this opera house \noriginates from the vibrations created by instruments— whether it’s the strings of a violin \nor the vocal folds of a performer. These vibrations send waves into the air, \nwhich our brains interpret as sound. The frequency of these vibrations–– specifically, the number \nof waves per second–– is how our brains determine \nthe pitch of a single note. But in fact, every note we hear is actually a combination \nof multiple vibrations. Imagine a guitar string vibrating \nat its lowest frequency. This is called the fundamental, and this low pitch is what our ears \nmostly use to identify a note. But this lowest vibration triggers \nadditional frequencies called overtones, which layer on top of the fundamental. These overtones break down \ninto specific frequencies called harmonics, or partials— and manipulating them \nis how opera singers work their magic. Every note has a set of frequencies \nthat comprise its harmonic series. The first partial vibrates \nat twice the frequency of the fundamental. The next partial is three times \nthe fundamental’s frequency, and so on. Virtually all acoustic instruments \nproduce harmonic series, but each instrument’s shape and material\nchanges the balance of its harmonics. For example, a flute emphasizes \nthe first few partials, but in a clarinet’s lowest register, the odd-numbered partials \nresonate most strongly. The strength of various partials is part of what gives each instrument\nits unique sonic signature. It also affects an instrument’s ability \nto stand out in a crowd, because our ears are more strongly \nattuned to some frequencies than others. This is the key to an opera singer’s \npower of projection. An operatic soprano— the highest of the four standard \nvoice parts— can produce notes \nwith fundamental frequencies ranging from 250 to 1,500 vibrations \nper second. Human ears are most sensitive \nto frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000 \nvibrations per second. So if the singer can bring out \nthe partials in this range, she can target a sensory sweet spot \nwhere she’s most likely to be heard. Higher partials are also advantageous because there’s less competition \nfrom the orchestra, whose overtones are weaker \nat those frequencies. The result of emphasizing \nthese partials is a distinctive ringing timbre \ncalled a singer’s squillo. Opera singers work for decades \nto create their squillo. They can produce higher frequencies by modifying the shape and tension \nin their vocal folds and vocal tract. And by shifting the position \nof their tongues and lips, they accentuate some overtones \nwhile dampening others. Singers also increase their range \nof partials with vibrato— a musical effect in which a note \nslightly oscillates in pitch. This creates a fuller sound \nthat rings out over the instruments’ \ncomparatively narrow vibratos. Once they have the right partials, they employ other techniques \nto boost their volume. Singers expand their lung capacity \nand perfect their posture for consistent, controlled airflow. The concert hall helps as well, with rigid surfaces that reflect \nsound waves towards the audience. All singers take advantage \nof these techniques, but different vocal signatures \ndemand different physical preparation. A Wagnerian singer needs \nto build up stamina to power through the composer’s \nfour-hour epics. While bel canto singers require \nversatile vocal folds to vault through acrobatic arias. Biology also sets some limits— not every technique is feasible \nfor every set of muscles, and voices change as singers age. But whether in an opera hall \nor a shower stall, these techniques can turn \nun-amplified voices into thundering musical masterpieces."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The balance of the harmonic series produced by each instrument is determined by its ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "pitch and dynamics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "shape and material"}, {"label": "C", "text": "tempo and rhythm"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Human ears are most sensitive to frequencies between _______ and _______ vibrations per second.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10, 20"}, {"label": "B", "text": "300, 500"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2000, 5000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8000, 9000"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The pitch of a note is determined by the frequency, which means the number of sound waves per________", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Second"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Minute"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hour"}, {"label": "D", "text": "day"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Every note we hear is actually a combination of multiple vibrations.

{"page": 15, "lesson": 24, "title": "Why germs thrive on planes— and how to stop them - Raymond Wang", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-germs-thrive-on-planes-and-how-to-stop-them-raymond-wang", "transcript": {"en": "Can I get a show of hands -- how many of you in this room\nhave been on a plane in this past year? That's pretty good. Well, it turns out that you\nshare that experience with more than three billion\npeople every year. And when we put so many people\nin all these metal tubes that fly all over the world, sometimes, things like this can happen and you get a disease epidemic. I first actually got into this topic when I heard about the Ebola\noutbreak last year. And it turns out that, although Ebola spreads\nthrough these more range-limited, large-droplet routes, there's all these other sorts of diseases that can be spread in the airplane cabin. The worst part is, when we take\na look at some of the numbers, it's pretty scary. So with H1N1, there was this guy that decided\nto go on the plane and in the matter of a single flight actually spread the disease\nto 17 other people. And then there was this\nother guy with SARS, who managed to go on a three-hour flight and spread the disease to 22 other people. That's not exactly my idea\nof a great superpower. When we take a look at this,\nwhat we also find is that it's very difficult\nto pre-screen for these diseases. So when someone actually\ngoes on a plane, they could be sick and they could actually\nbe in this latency period in which they could actually\nhave the disease but not exhibit any symptoms, and they could, in turn,\nspread the disease to many other people in the cabin. How that actually works is that right now we've got air coming in\nfrom the top of the cabin and from the side of the cabin,\nas you see in blue. And then also, that air goes out\nthrough these very efficient filters that eliminate 99.97 percent\nof pathogens near the outlets. What happens right now, though, is that we have this\nmixing airflow pattern. So if someone were to actually sneeze, that air would get swirled\naround multiple times before it even has a chance\nto go out through the filter. So I thought: clearly, this\nis a pretty serious problem. I didn't have the money\nto go out and buy a plane, so I decided to build a computer instead. It actually turns out that\nwith computational fluid dynamics, what we're able to do\nis create these simulations that give us higher resolutions than actually physically going\nin and taking readings in the plane. And so how, essentially, this works\nis you would start out with these 2D drawings -- these are floating around\nin technical papers around the Internet. I take that and then I put it\ninto this 3D-modeling software, really building that 3D model. And then I divide that model\nthat I just built into these tiny pieces, essentially meshing it so that\nthe computer can better understand it. And then I tell the computer where\nthe air goes in and out of the cabin, throw in a bunch of physics and basically sit there and wait until\nthe computer calculates the simulation. So what we get, actually,\nwith the conventional cabin is this: you'll notice the middle person sneezing, and we go \"Splat!\" -- it goes\nright into people's faces. It's pretty disgusting. From the front, you'll notice\nthose two passengers sitting next to the central passenger not exactly having a great time. And when we take a look\nat that from the side, you'll also notice those pathogens\nspreading across the length of the cabin. The first thing I thought was,\n\"This is no good.\" So I actually conducted\nmore than 32 different simulations and ultimately, I came up\nwith this solution right here. This is what I call a -- patent pending --\nGlobal Inlet Director. With this, we're able to reduce\npathogen transmission by about 55 times, and increase fresh-air inhalation\nby about 190 percent. So how this actually works is we would install this piece\nof composite material into these existing spots\nthat are already in the plane. So it's very cost-effective to install and we can do this directly overnight. All we have to do is put a couple\nof screws in there and you're good to go. And the results that we get\nare absolutely amazing. Instead of having those problematic\nswirling airflow patterns, we can create these walls of air that come down in-between the passengers to create personalized breathing zones. So you'll notice the middle passenger\nhere is sneezing again, but this time, we're able\nto effectively push that down to the filters for elimination. And same thing from the side, you'll notice we're able to directly\npush those pathogens down. So if you take a look again now\nat the same scenario but with this innovation installed, you'll notice the middle\npassenger sneezes, and this time, we're pushing\nthat straight down into the outlet before it gets a chance\nto infect any other people. So you'll notice the two passengers\nsitting next to the middle guy are breathing virtually\nno pathogens at all. Take a look at that from the side as well, you see a very efficient system. And in short, with this system, we win. When we take a look at what this means, what we see is that this not only works\nif the middle passenger sneezes, but also if the window-seat\npassenger sneezes or if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes. And so with this solution, what does\nthis mean for the world? Well, when we take a look at this from the computer simulation\ninto real life, we can see with this 3D model\nthat I built over here, essentially using 3D printing, we can see those same\nairflow patterns coming down, right to the passengers. In the past, the SARS epidemic\nactually cost the world about 40 billion dollars. And in the future, a big disease outbreak\ncould actually cost the world in excess of three trillion dollars. So before, it used to be that you had\nto take an airplane out of service for one to two months, spend tens of thousands of man hours\nand several million dollars to try to change something. But now, we're able to install\nsomething essentially overnight and see results right away. So it's really now a matter of taking\nthis through to certification, flight testing, and going through all of these\nregulatory approvals processes. But it just really goes to show\nthat sometimes the best solutions are the simplest solutions. And two years ago, even, this project would not have happened, just because the technology then\nwouldn't have supported it. But now with advanced computing and how developed our Internet is, it's really the golden era for innovation. And so the question I ask all\nof you today is: why wait? Together, we can build the future today. Thanks. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
