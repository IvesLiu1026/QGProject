Romeo: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? Juliet: What satisfaction canst thou have tonight? Romeo: The exchange of thy love's faithful vows for mine. Without dialogue: (cricket sounds) So what goes into writing effective dialogue? Well, there are social skills: making friends, solving conflicts, being pleasant and polite. We won't be using any of those today. Instead, we'll be working on -- let's call them \"anti-social skills.\" If you're a writer, you may already have a few of these. The first is eavesdropping. If you're riding a bus and hear an interesting conversation, you could write it all down. Of course, when you write fiction, you're not describing real people, you're making up characters. But sometimes the words you overhear can give you ideas. \"I did not,\" says one person. \"I saw you,\" the other replies. Who might be saying those words? Maybe it's two kids in a class, and the boy thinks the girl pushed him. Maybe it's a couple, but one of them is a vampire, and the woman vampire saw the man flirting with a zombie. Or maybe not. Maybe the characters are a teenager and his mother, and they're supposed to be vegetarians, but the mother saw him eating a burger. So let's say you've decided on some characters. This is anti-social skill number two: start pretending they're real. What are they like? Where are they from? What music do they listen to? Spend some time with them. If you're on a bus, think about what they might be doing if they were there too. Would they talk on the phone, listen to music, draw pictures, sleep? What we say depends on who we are. An older person might speak differently than a younger person. Someone from the south might speak differently than someone from the north. Once you know your characters, you can figure out how they talk. At this stage, it's helpful to use anti-social skill number three: muttering to yourself. When you speak your character's words, you can hear whether they sound natural, and fix them if necessary. Remember, most people are usually pretty informal when they speak. They use simple language and contractions. So, \"Do not attempt to lie to me\" sounds more natural as \"Don't try to lie to me.\" Also keep it short. People tend to speak in short bursts, not lengthy speeches. And let the dialogue do the work. Ask yourself: do I really need that adverb? For instance, \"'Your money or your life,' she said threateningly.\" Here, \"threateningly\" is redundant, so you can get rid of it. But if the words and the actions don't match, an adverb can be helpful. \"'Your money or your life,' she said lovingly.\" So, to recap: First, eavesdrop. Next, pretend imaginary people are real. Finally, mutter to yourself, and write it all down. You already have everything you need. This is fictional dialogue, or \"How to Hear Voices in Your Head.\""}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why might an author add dialogue to a story?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To give it color"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To make it exciting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To move it forward"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which one of the following skills goes into writing dialogue?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Conflict resolution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eavesdropping"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Networking"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Behaving politely"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why is it useful to mutter to yourself while writing dialogue?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It helps you see how your story might end."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It helps you get a seat to yourself on the bus."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It helps you figure out whether the dialogue sounds realistic."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It helps you come up with additional characters."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Imagine you are writing dialogue for two teenagers at a party.

It starts going down, fast. What would happen if you jumped right when it started going down? Would the ceiling hit your head? Ouch! Do you stay suspended in the air while the elevator plummets down? Let's examine the elevator problem one step at a time. First, consider a scale. You know, the kind of scale you weigh yourself on. When you step on a scale to weigh yourself, there are two forces involved. One, gravity pulls you down. Two, the scale pushes you up. What? You didn't know a scale could push? Of course it can! If it didn't push up on you, you would go crashing through the floor. This upward push is called the normal force and yes, it is normally there. Since you're just standing there on the scale, you're not moving. Therefore, you're not accelerating. Newton's second law of motion -- net force equals mass times acceleration -- tells us that if the acceleration equals zero, the net force must equal zero. Which means that the force of gravity pulling you down must be equal to the force of the scale pushing you up. Now let's suppose you're standing on that scale in an elevator. At first, the elevator is standing still, so you and the scale are standing still. The two forces on you are equal and opposite. You can read how hard the scale is pushing by looking at it. We call that your weight. Then, the elevator starts falling down. You and the scale are in the elevator, so you are falling down too, faster and faster. That means you are accelerating downward. Now there is a net force in the same direction as the acceleration -- down. Since gravity hasn't changed, that must mean the scale isn't pushing up as hard. So the scale is reading a smaller number. The faster the elevator accelerates, the less the scale pushes up. What if you jumped? Would you stop falling? Would the elevator hit your head? Well, what's pulling the elevator down? Gravity. Is gravity pulling on you? Of course. So your relative position in the elevator will stay the same. The ceiling will only hit you if you can jump up to the ceiling. Now consider: what would happen if the elevator accelerated upward and, even more frightening, if someone snuck in and cut the cable holding the elevator, what would happen then?

{"page": 71, "lesson": 3, "title": "What is chromatography?", "category": "Environmental Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/4bURoBhk", "transcript": {"en": " So why does this turn\ninto this in the fall? I live in Boston, which\nmeans that about this time each year, the\nleaves on the trees start to turn their colors. Leaves get their color\nfrom three main compounds. The first is chlorophyll,\nwhich might sound familiar. Chlorophyll is involved\nin photosynthesis, which is the process\nby which plants turn CO2 and water\ninto sugar and oxygen by harnessing the\nenergy from the sun. Chlorophyll gives most plants\ntheir distinctive green color. The second group of compounds\nare the carotenoids, which sounds a little bit\nlike carrot, which makes sense because carotenoids give leaves\nthere yellow and orange hues. Carotenoids are present with\nchlorophyll in organelles called chloroplasts year round. And these chloroplasts\nare just the organelles where photosynthesis occurs. Finally, there's a\ngroup of compounds known as anthocyanins. And anthocyanins give\nplants reddish hues. And they're often\nfound in things like cranberries,\nand blueberries, and lots of dark red leaves. These anthocyanins\nare actually produced in the fall when chlorophyll\nstarts to break down, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Now, for most of the\nyear, chlorophyll is so bright green\nthat it blocks out some of the yellow\nand orange hues coming from the carotenoids. For most of the growing\nseason, chlorophyll is constantly being broken\ndown and reproduced. But as it starts\nto get colder out, the cool night air closes\noff the veins of the leaves. And it gets harder for\nwater and nutrients to move into the chloroplasts\nand rebuild chlorophyll. So what this means is\nthat the chlorophyll is being broken down, but\nit's not being reproduced. So the green color of the\nleaves starts to disappear. This means that the yellows and\nthe oranges of the carotenoids can start to show through. But that's not all. Anthocyanins, by contrast,\nare not present year round in the leaves. Instead, they are actively\nproduced in the fall right before the leaves\ndrop off the trees. So why would a\nplant suddenly want to start producing a red\npigment in a leaf that's about to drop off anyways? Scientists haven't reached\na definitive conclusion yet. But they do have some\npretty good ideas. One is that the red pigments act\nas a sort of direct sunscreen as the canopy starts\nto drop leaves. The leaves that remain\nare exposed to more light. And those leaves are losing\nthe sunlight-absorbing powers of their chlorophyll. Another cool idea is that the\nred pigment might actually trick migrating insects into\nthinking that the tree is unhealthy and discouraging\nthem from laying their eggs on those trees. So all of this leads us to\nsome pretty cool science that you can do at home to\nvisualize the pigments found in leaves where you live. So all you need\nfor this experiment is isopropyl alcohol, some\nstrips of filter paper-- I used coffee filters-- a couple glasses,\nscissors, and some leaves. And if you want\nto be super cool, pick a few different\nkinds of leaves, so that you can compare the\ncompounds you find within them. Step one, chop each of your\nkinds of leaves up into lots of little tiny pieces. We really want to release\nall of these compounds out of the leaves. So the smaller and the\nfiner you chop them, the better this\nis going to work. Next, cover the leaves\nin isopropyl alcohol. Now, this is just\nrubbing alcohol, so it's not very dangerous. But you do want to make sure\nyou don't get this in your eyes or drink it. The next step is to grind up\nthese leaves in the alcohol. Now, ideally, you would be doing\nthis with a mortar and pestle. but I don't have that. And so I am using\na wooden spoon. Now, at this point,\nyou should start to see the alcohol change colors\nas those pigments are released from the leaves. If you want to speed\nthis reaction up a bit, you can set all of your\nglasses into a hot water bath and leave them for\nabout 30 minutes. After this, you can really\nsee the color change in the alcohol. Now, I strained the\nleaves out of my alcohol, so that it was a\nlittle easier to see. But you could probably\nleave them in there as well. Next, cut your filter\npaper into strips and place a strip into each\nglass so that one side of it is touching the alcohol and the\nother side is out in the air. Now, I repeated this\nexperiment later with longer strips\nof filter paper and hung one side\nout of the edge. And this actually worked\na little bit better. Now, you want to let your\nglasses sit for about an hour. So what we're doing here\nis called chromatography, which just means that we\nare separating a mixture. Here, we are using\npaper chromatography to separate the different\ncompounds within the leaves. So the alcohol,\nour mobile phase, is being drawn up the paper\nstrip, our stationary phase, and it's pulling leaf\npigments along with it. Depending on their\nchemical structure, molecules will have\ndifferent polarities and will want to interact\nwith that paper differently. Some will want to stick\ntightly onto the paper, while others will move more\neasily with the liquid. This means that some compounds\nwill travel along the paper faster than others, separating\nthe compounds along the strip, and giving you distinct\nbands of compounds. Cool. So we actually got some\nreally good separation between the yellow\ncarotenoids on top and the green chlorophyll\non the bottom. And the longer you leave these,\nthe better that separation will get. Now, this is an experiment\nyou can easily do at home, and you should. I want to see what the\ncompounds from leaves from all around the world look like. So make a video response of\nyou doing this experiment, and leave it below. And I'll check them all out. And yeah, go on. Go forth.

{"page": 71, "lesson": 4, "title": "How Caffeine Works", "category": "Nutrition", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/gTGfE82A", "transcript": {"en": "Caffeine a legal stimulant that most of us are pretty familiar with, many of us use every day, and some of us are addicted to. If you are a caffeine user, you probably know your limits. For me one small cup of coffee in the morning can help keep me alert and focused, whereas  two small cups of coffee in the morning can turn me into a cat on catnip. Well for the purposes of this video and to best demonstrate the physical and mental effects of caffeine, I'm going to get very very caffeinated very very fast. For science. Go big or go home. Caffeine is a stimulant drug that acts on your central nervous system. Because caffeine is both lipid and water soluble it  can easily pass through the blood-brain barrier and act on the interior of your brain Once there, caffeine works by diminishing the effect of a neurotransmitter called adenosine. Adenosine acts as a suppressor for your nervous system, reducing neural activity and slowing everything down. Caffeine and adenosine have similar shapes so caffeine can bind to the same neuroreceptors that adenosine does. But because caffeine is not adenosine, it doesn't turn these neuroreceptors on. This is called competitive inhibition. Caffeine competes with adenosine to bind with the same receptors, And because caffeine is bound, adenosine cannot bind and its effects are inhibited. Long story short, caffeine prevents adenosine from slowing down your nervous system. So this explain part of why you feel more awake, alert and active with caffeine flowing through your veins. But adenosine inhibition isn't the only thing that caffeine does. Oh no. Caffeine also stimulates the production of adrenaline or epinephrine. Adrenaline is a pretty well known hormone involved in the fight-or-flight response. It causes all sort of physiological reactions! It increases your heart rate, increases the blood flow to your muscles, opens up your airways, causes your blood\npressure to rise, and also causes you're  your liver to release extra sugar into your blood stream for an added boost of energy. It also causes your muscle to tighten up, which would be useful if you were the lone human on the savannah, deciding or not to fight or flee from that lion over the distance, But as a modern twenty something sitting in from of my camera, it just give me the jitters. Finally caffeine also plays with the dopamine levels in your brain. Awesome, yeah. Caffeine increases the amount of dopamine present in your brain by slowing down its reabsorption, Much in the same way that cocaine increases the amount of dopamine present by slowing down how quickly it can be sucked back into your brain tissue. This means that caffeine also makes you feel good and this interaction with dopamine is how you can actually build a caffeine addiction. So now you're a happy, jittery, fight or flight ready bundle caffeine! Now what? Well the now what really depends on how your specific body metabolizes caffeine. The average half-life of caffeine in the human body is about six hours. so this means that if you have two hundred milligrams of caffeine in your average cup of coffee at 9am in the morning, then 6 hours later half of that will be left, so at 3pm you will have a hundred milligrams of caffeine left, and then another 6 hours later you will have half of the hundred you will have half of the hundred so you will have 50 milligrams of caffeine left at 9 o'clock at night. But dude, who stops at just one cup of coffee? Not this chick. So how much caffeine is too much caffeine? A lethal dose of caffeine is about two hundred milligrams per kilogram so it would take about nine thousand five hundred milligrams of caffeine to kill me. Now, there are about two hundred milligrams of caffeine in a standard cup of coffee, so that's about forty eight cups of coffee, which is a surprisingly low number, but I would have to drink all 48 of those before my body started to metabolize the caffeine, which means I would literally have to chug 48 cups of coffee. I literally wouldn't be able to drink that much coffee, both because my stomach couldn't hold that volume of liquid and also because as every coffee drinker knows, caffeine is a diuretic. before I got to cup forty anyways, the stimulant effect of caffeine would be  jacked up so high that that the alertness and awakeness would be transformed into mania,  disorientation and hallucinations... great! What would eventually kill you would be ventricular fibrillation, which basically means  that your heart would caffeine jitter itself to death. So moral of the story, caffeine is a drug. It is a stimulant that has some pretty noticeable effects on your body, can cause addiction, and, in high enough doses, can kill you. So caffeinate wisely! Go forth, do science! My hand is actually not shaking too bad right now. Don't try this at home, I know a lot of people do drink that much caffeine all on one day and  sometimes I approach it,  but I certainly don't do it over the span of 20 minutes. I actually don't feel as terrible as I thought I would have after that amount, but I certainly don't feel good either."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "True or False: Caffeine can pass through the blood-brain barrier.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not an effect of adrenaline?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increased Heartrate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Closes Airways"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increase in Blood Pressure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increased Blood Flow to Muscles"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Sugar Release from Liver"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the half-life of caffeine in the average human body?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2 Hours"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4 Hours"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6 Hours"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8 Hours"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

The closer he gets, the more nervous he becomes, the budding zit on his nose growing bigger and bigger until it practically eclipses his face. She looks at him hovering nearby, sees the massive zit, and giggles. He slumps away, feeling sick. Stress can sure make a mess, and it happens to both teens and adults. But how does it happen? Let's rewind to before the zit, to before Justin even sees his crush. Already late for school, Justin got to class just in time to hear the teacher say \"pop quiz.\" He hadn't done his homework the night before, and felt more unprepared than the ambushed World War II soldiers he was supposed to write about. A sudden rush of panic swept over his body, leaving him with sweaty palms, a foggy mind and a racing heart. He stumbled out of class in a daze, and ran straight into his all-time crush, spiking up his stress. Stress is a general biological response to a potential danger. In primitive caveman terms, stress can make you fight for your life, or run for your life, if, for example, you're confronted by a hungry saber-tooth tiger. Special chemicals called stress hormones run through your body, giving you more oxygen and power to run away from danger or to face it and fight for your life, hence the term \"fight or flight.\" But when you don't fight, or take flight, you face the plight. When we're taking final exams, sitting in traffic or pondering pollution, we internalize stress. It all begins in the brain. The hypothalamus, the master controller of your hormones, releases something called corticotropin-releasing hormone. This triggers the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland found at the base of the brain, to release adrenocorticotropic hormone which then stimulates the adrenal gland sitting on top of the kidneys to release cortisol, the major stress hormone. These natural chemicals are a great help when you need to run away quickly, or do superhuman feats of courage, but when you're simply sitting, these stress hormones collect in the body and affect your overall health. Stress hormones increase inflammation in the body, suppress the immune system, which makes you more susceptible to infection by acne-causing bacteria, and can even increase oil production in the skin. And this is the perfect storm for forming a pimple. Cortisol is a major stress hormone involved in making skin cells churn out oily lipids from special glands called sebaceous glands. But when there's too much of these oily lipids, called sebum, they can plug up the swollen, inflamed pores and trap the pesky, acne-causing bacteria inside, where they set up house and thrive. Add a dash of inflammatory neuropeptides released by the nervous system when you're -- well, nervous -- and angry zits follow. To make matters worse, Justin is a boy, meaning he's got more testosterone than girls. Testosterone is another hormone that increases oil production in the skin. So, his already oily skin, together with a boost in oil and inflammation from stress, is the perfect environment for bacteria to swell, swell, swell up into a major zit. So what could've Justin done to avoid the big pimple? Stressful situations are unavoidable. But we can try to change our responses so that we're not so stressed in the end. And had he been confident in approaching her, she might not have noticed the pimple, or he might not have had one."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are the fight-or-flight chemicals called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Inflammatory neuropeptides"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stress hormones"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Oily lipids"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hypothalamic chemicals"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In what part of the brain does the stress response begin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pituitary gland"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Adrenal gland"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hippocampus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hypothalamus"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What male hormone also increases oil production?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Estrogen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cortisol"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Testosterone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Progesterone"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What skin glands produce the oily lipids called sebum?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Adrenal glands"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sebaceous glands"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sweat glands"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pineal glands"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What major stress hormone increases inflammation and makes sebaceous glands produce more oil in the skin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cortisol"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Norepinephrine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Epinephrine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Estrogen"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 71, "lesson": 6, "title": "An antihero of one’s own - Tim Adams", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/an-anti-hero-of-one-s-own-tim-adams", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: tom carter\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Literary critic Northrop Frye once observed that in our primitive days, our literary heroes were -- well, nearly gods, and as civilization advanced, they came down the mountain of the gods, so to speak, and became more human, more flawed, less heroic. From the divine heroes like Hercules, down the mountain below the miraculous but mortal heroes such as Beowulf, the great leaders such as King Arthur, and the great but flawed heroes like Macbeth or Othello. Below even the unlikely but eventual heroes such as Harry Potter, Luke Skywalker, or Hiccup, until we reach the bottom and meet the anti-hero. Contrary to the sound, the anti-hero is not the villain, not the antagonist. The anti-hero is actually the main character in some contemporary works of literature. Guy Montag in \"Fahrenheit 451,\" Winston Smith in \"1984,\" who unwittingly ends up challenging those in power -- that is, those who abuse their power to brainwash the populace to believe that the ills of society have been eliminated. Ideally, those who challenge the establishment should be wise, confident, brave, physically strong, with a type of charisma that inpires followers. The anti-hero, however, at best demonstrates a few underdeveloped traits, at worst, is totally inept. The story of the anti-hero usually unfolds something like this. The anti-hero initially conforms, ignorantly accepting the established views, a typical, unquestioning, brainwashed member of society. The anti-hero struggles to conform, all the while starting to object, perhaps finding other outsiders with whom to voice his questions, and naïvely, unwisely, sharing those questions with an authority figure. The anti-hero openly challenges society, and tries to fight against the lies and tactics used to oppress the populace. This step, for the anti-hero, is seldom a matter of brave, wise and heroic opposition. Maybe the anti-hero fights and succeeds in destroying the oppressive government, with a lot of impossible luck. Perhaps he or she runs away, escapes to fight another day. All too often though, the anti-hero is killed, or brainwashed to return to conformity with the masses. No heroic triumph here, no brave individual standing up against impersonal institutions of a modern world, inspiring others to fight, or resourcefully outwitting and outgunning the massive army of the evil empire. Our storytelling ancestors calmed our fears of powerlessness by giving us Hercules and other heroes strong enough to fight off the demons and monsters that we suspected haunted the night beyond our campfires. But eventually, we realized the monsters did not lie out there, they reside inside of us. Beowulf's greatest enemy was mortality. Othello's, jealousy. Hiccup, self-doubt.

I mean, you're the President of the United\nStates: a country with five thousand nuclear weapons, birthplace of the world's computing\nand telecommunications industry, home of the first atomic clock and creator of the global\npositioning system. But chances are, if you just took regular\nAmerican high school physics, you don't know one iota about the science behind these things\n(No offense). That's because high school physics students\nacross most of America are not required to learn about pretty much any physical phenomena\ndiscovered or explained more recently than 1865. Yes, 1865. That's the year the civil war ended and well\nover a decade before Albert Einstein was even born! You know what can happen in 150 years, Mr.\nPresident? A lot. Velcro, for one. But let me list some useful and important\nideas of the last 150 years of physics that aren't a required part of most standard US\nhigh school physics courses: Photons. The structure of atoms. The existence of Antimatter. GPS. Lasers. Transistors. Diodes and LEDs. Quarks. Chaos Theory. Electron Microscopy. MRI scanning. The Big Bang. Black Holes. Star formation. The fact that gravity bends light. The fact that the universe is expanding. The Higgs Boson and the weak and strong nuclear\nforces and all the rest of quantum mechanics and relativity and the topic of every single\nNobel Prize in Physics since… always. Basically, most of the important stuff. I mean, Mr. President, imagine if history\nclasses didn't talk about the abolition of slavery, world wars I or II, the great depression,\nthe rise of the US as a global superpower, the cold war or the civil rights movement\nor heaven forbid the first African American President. Or imagine if biology classes didn't talk\nabout DNA, or hormones, or cell reproduction or the modern germ theory of disease or ecology. Or if geologists didn't talk about plate tectonics. And computer scientists… well… in 1865 a computer was a person who\ncomputed your taxes. Now, if you were lucky enough to have an ambitious\nteacher or take Advanced Placement Physics, then you might have learned about some of\nEinstein's discoveries of 1905! Yes! Current events! But learning about how Einstein's work helped\nset the stage for a century of amazing developments in our understanding of the universe is not\na part of the standard curriculum. So why, Mr. President, am I addressing this\nletter to you? Well, you appoint the Secretary of Education,\nfor one - and I do believe that high school physics is somewhat related to education. Now, maybe your education secretary says,\n\"ancient physics is already hard to teach to high schoolers. And you want us to teach them modern physics\nwhich is even harder?! Students can't really appreciate the beauty\nof modern physics without fancy college level mathematics.\" RUBBISH. Ever heard of Carl Sagan? Richard Feynman? Or Neil deGrasse Tyson? These great men have been 100% committed to\nthe appreciation and dissemination of the awesomeness of the universe. And we should be too. How else are we supposed to foster and find\nour future brilliant innovators, inventors, and explorers? How can we expect to educate our citizens\nfor the next century if we don't teach about the last? And that's not to say that we should ignore\nmath, either - on the contrary, math is one of the most beautiful and awesome things in\nthe universe, especially because it allows us to understand the universe. In particular, the last 150 years have borne\nfruit to perhaps the most drastic changes in our understanding of the universe, ever,\nand these new ways of thinking and solving problems should be the centerpiece of an education\nin physics. Between you and me, Mr. President, I think\nwe'd better start making physics education more awesome here in the US, otherwise the\nnext Carl Sagan or Richard Feynman will come from somewhere with more educational foresight\n- maybe even, the Internet. Sincerely, A collection of atoms known as Henry ps you're probably super busy, but if you'd\nlike to hear about physics education across the Atlantic, I highly recommend heading over\nto Brady's channel, Sixty Symbols, for a perspective from the UK.

Each of those galaxies contains about 100 billion stars. Many of those stars have planets orbiting them. So how do we look for life in all that immensity? It's like searching for a needle in trillions of haystacks. We might want to focus our search on planets that we know can support life as we know it -- what we call habitable worlds. What do such planets look like? To answer that question, we don't look out there. Instead, we look at ourselves. At Earth. Because this is the one planet in the universe that we know for certain is habitable. When we look at Earth from space, we see a blue, watery world. It's no coincidence that three quarters of the surface is covered by oceans. Because of its unique chemical and physical properties, water is absolutely essential for all life as we know it. And so we get especially excited about other worlds on which water is abundant. Fortunately, water is very common in the universe. But life needs water in the form of liquid, not ice, and not vapor, and that's a little bit less common. For a planet to have liquid water at its surface, three things are important. First, the planet needs to be large enough that the force of gravity keeps the water molecules from flying off into space. For example, Mars is smaller than Earth, and so has less gravity, and that's one important reason that Mars has a very thin atmosphere, and no oceans at its surface. Second, the planet needs to have an atmosphere. Why? Because without an atmosphere, the planet is in a vacuum, and liquid water isn't stable in a vacuum. For example, our moon has no atmosphere, and so if you spill some water on the moon, it will either boil away as vapor, or freeze solid to make ice. Without the pressure of an atmosphere, liquid water can't survive. Third, the planet needs to be at the right distance from its star. Too close, and the surface temperature will exceed the boiling point of water, and oceans will turn to vapor. Too far, and the surface temperature will fall below the freezing point of water, causing the oceans to turn to ice. Fire or ice. For life as we know it, neither will suffice. You can imagine that the perfect zone where water stays liquid looks kind of like a belt around a star. We call that belt the habitable zone. So when we search for habitable worlds, we definitely want to look for planets in the habitable zones around their stars. Those regions are the best bets to find planets like Earth. But while habitable zones are a pretty good place to begin the search for planets with life, there are a couple of complications. First, a planet isn't necessarily habitable just because it's in the habitable zone. Consider the planet Venus in our solar system. If you were an alien astronomer, you'd think Venus is a pretty good bet for life. It's the right size, it has an atmosphere, and it's in the habitable zone of our sun. An alien astronomer might see it as Earth's twin. But Venus is not habitable, at least not at its surface. Not by life as we know it. It's too hot. That's because Venus' atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas. In fact, its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide, and is almost 100 times thicker than our own. As a result, the temperature on Venus is hot enough to melt lead, and the planet is dry as a bone. So finding planets of the right size and distance from their stars is only a beginning. We also want to know about the makeup of their atmospheres. The second complication emerges when we look a little more deeply at planet Earth. In the last 30 years, we've discovered microbes living in all sorts of extreme environments. We find them in fissures of rock miles beneath our feet, in boiling waters of the ocean floor, in acidic waters of thermal springs, and in cloud droplets miles above our heads. These so-called extremophiles aren't rare. Some scientists estimate that the mass of microbes living deep underground equals the mass of all the life at Earth's surface. These subterranean microbes don't need oceans or sunshine. These discoveries suggest that Earth-like planets may be only the tip of the astrobiological iceberg. It's possible that life might persist in aquifers beneath the surface of Mars. Microbes may thrive on Jupiter's moon Europa, where liquid water ocean probably lies beneath the icy crust. Another ocean beneath the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus is the source of geysers erupting into space. Could these geysers be raining microbes? Could we fly through them to find out? And what about life as we don't know it, using a liquid other than water? Maybe we are the crazy creatures living in an unusual and extreme environment. Maybe the real habitable zone is so large that there are billions of needles in those trillions of haystacks. Maybe in the big scheme of things, Earth is only one of many different kinds of habitable worlds. The only way to find out is to go out and explore."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What do we call planets that can support life as we know it?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Super-Earths"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Habitable worlds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Home planets"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Life Supporting Extraterrestrial Bodies (LSEB's)"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Water is very common in the universe, but, according to Anbar, what necessary-to-life condition are scientists searching for on other planets?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Water that contains an abundance of sodium ions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Water in its liquid state (not ice or vapor)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Water that remains a constant temperature (with minimal variation)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "As long as water exists, scientists aren't worried about specific conditions"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why does Mars have no oceans at its surface?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All water on Mars would turn into vapor because Mars is too close to the Sun resulting in surface temperatures that exceed water's boiling point."}, {"label": "B", "text": "There is no water on Mars in any form."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because Mars is small, it has less gravity and has lost its water to space."}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why do planets need to have an atmosphere in order for liquid water to exist?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Planets without an atmosphere are in a vacuum, and liquid water is unstable in a vacuum (it boils away or freezes)."}, {"label": "B", "text": "There is no such thing as a planet without an atmosphere."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Water enters another state of matter (called hydrogrix) when present on planets without an atmosphere."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Planets do not need an atmosphere in order for liquid water to exist."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What makes Venus an uninhabitable world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Its atmosphere is nearly 100% carbon dioxide causing surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead (too hot for liquid water)."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It lacks an atmosphere causing a vacuum-like environment in which no life is thought to be able to survive."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Temperature varies so greatly between boiling hot and freezing cold, it's believed that no life forms could survive there."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Venus is not an uninhabitable world."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

There was a time when no animals lived on land. All life was in the ocean. The ocean's where all of us animals got our start, more than half a billion years ago, This is where all animal body types -- or phyla, as scientists call them -- first evolved. You know, there are more than 30 animal phyla, but only a handful of major ones had what it took to do something completely daring: step out of the ocean, and on to dry land. So, which of these land-dwelling phyla first invaded the land? Was it me and my mollusc friends, with our amazing mantles and single foot? Perhaps the chordate crowd, with their notochords, segmented muscles and big bony skeletons. Or maybe those lowly annelid worms, with their powerful ringed bodies. Or did the Arthropods first make landfall, with their little flexible suits of armor -- their exoskeleton? Ah, yes. The arthropods. From crustaceans to millipedes, spiders to insects, the arthropods outnumber all animals on land. So what's their secret? Their exoskeleton is key, but here's the real kicker: jointed appendages. They're like little living Swiss army knives: antennae, multiple mouth parts, an obscene number of legs, if you ask me. There's one group of arthropods -- the insects -- that really rule the land. Three body parts, six legs, and an annoying tendency to take over. Sure, they have to molt to grow, but that doesn't seem to pose a problem. The insects even invented the first wings, and conquered the skies. Ah, well. So what if arthropods were the first to reach land and invent flight, a hundred million years before the rest of us? So what if they pollinate crops around the world, and make up 75% of all land animal species? And that for every single human, there's 200 million of them? Sure, those leggy arthropods may still be in the lead when it comes to conquering land, but we still rule in the sea. There are more species of molluscs in the ocean than any other animal phylum.

Round-the-clock ads on radio and television. The phone rings. It's a robo-call from the president, or his opponent, asking for your money, and your vote. And while you're at it, watch their YouTube videos and like them on Facebook. Election time. We all know the look and feel of modern campaigns. But what was it like in the early days of the Republic, when, say, George Washington ran for office? Well, in fact, he didn't run. When Washington became the first president in 1789, there were no political parties, no conventions or primaries, no campaign, no election season. Not really any candidates. Even the year was odd. Literally. 1789 was the only presidential election ever held in an odd year. After the framers invented the constitution and the presidency 225 years ago, the country set about the business of choosing its first executive. Agreeing with Ben Franklin, many people thought \"The first man at the helm will be a good one,\" and by that, Franklin meant George Washington. Greatest hero of the Revolution, Washington presided over the convention that created the constitution, rarely speaking. He never discussed the job of president, or of wanting it. And when the first presidential election took place, it was a crazy-quilt affair, with many hands stitching the pattern. Under the new constitution, each state was given a number of electors. who would cast a vote for two names. The man with the most votes would be president, the second-place finisher was vice president. Ah, but who picked the electors? That was left up to the states. Six of them let the people decide, or at least white men over 21 who owned property. In New Jersey, some women voted, a right later taken away. But in other states, the legislature picked the electors. At that time, many people thought democracy was one step away from mob rule and a decision this important should be left to wiser men. These electors then voted for president. All the states had to do was get their votes in on time. But there were glitches. Only 10 of the 13 states voted. Rhode Island and North Carolina hadn't ratified the constitution and couldn't vote. New York missed the deadline for naming its electors, and also was not counted. When the votes were tallied, it was unanimous. George Washington won easily. John Adams trailed far behind, finishing second, and became the vice president. Told of his victory, George Washington was not surprised. At Mount Vernon, his bags were already packed. He moved to New York City, the nation's temporary capital, and he would have to figure out just what a president was supposed to do. Since that first election, American democracy and elections have come a long way. The constitution has been changed to open up voting to more people: black men, women, Native Americans, and eighteen-year-olds included. Getting that basic right extended to all those people has been a long, hard struggle. So when you think you can't stand any more of those lawn signs, and TV ads, just remember: the right to vote wasn't always for everyone, and that's a piece of history worth knowing."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In what year was George Washington first elected President?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1776"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1787"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1789"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1792"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "To what political party did George Washington belong?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Federalist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Democratic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Republican"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No Party"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Under the original plan for electing the president, the vice president was:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The second-place voter getter"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chosen by the new president"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chosen by the Senate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Selected by lottery"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In 1789, the states decided who could vote.

{"page": 71, "lesson": 11, "title": "Does your vote count? The Electoral College explained - Christina Greer", "category": "Civics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/does-your-vote-count-the-electoral-college-explained-christina-greer", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: tom carter\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Most people have heard of the Electoral College during presidential election years. But what exactly is the Electoral College? Simply said, it is a group of people appointed by each state who formally elect the President and Vice President of the United States. To understand how this process began and how it continues today, we can look at the Constitution of the United States: article two, section one, clause two of the constitution. It specifies how many electors each state is entitled to have. Since 1964, there have been 538 electors in each presidential election. How do they decide on the number 538? Well, the number of electors is equal to the total voting membership of the United States Congress. 435 representatives, plus 100 senators, and 3 electors from the District of Columbia. Essentially, the Democratic candidate and Republican candidate are each trying to add up the electors in every state so that they surpass 270 electoral votes, or just over half the 538 votes, and win the presidency. So how do states even get electoral votes? Each state receives a particular number of electors based on population size. The census is conducted every 10 years, so every time the census happens, states might gain or lose a few electoral votes. Let's say you're a voter in California, a state with 55 electoral votes. If your candidate wins in California, they get all 55 of the state's electoral votes. If your candidate loses, they get none. This is why many presidential candidates want to win states like Texas, Florida, and New York. If you currently add up the electoral votes of those three states, you would have 96 electoral votes. Even if a candidate won North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire. Connecticut and West Virginia, they would only gain 31 electoral votes total from those eight states. Here is where it can get a little tricky. On a rare occasion, like in the year 2000, someone can win the popular vote but fail to gain 270 electoral votes. This means that the winner may have won and collected their electoral votes by small margins, winning just enough states with just enough electoral votes, but the losing candidate may have captured large voter margins in the remaining states. If this is the case, the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states would add up to over 50% of the ballots cast nationally. Therefore, the losing candidate may have gained more than 50% of the ballots cast by voters, but failed to gain 270 of the electoral votes. Some critics of the electoral college argue the system gives an unfair advantage to states with large numbers of electoral votes. Think of it this way. It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person's vote -- not one vote -- in 39 states, or the District of Columbia, yet be elected president by winning the popular vote in just 11 of these 12 states: California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia or Virginia. This is why both parties pay attention to these states. However, others argue that the electoral college protects small states such as Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire, and even geographically large states with small populations like Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas. That's because a candidate can't completely ignore small states, because in a close election, every electoral vote counts. There are certain states that have a long history of voting for a particular party. These are known as \"safe states.\" For the past four election cycles -- in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 -- Democrats could count on states like Oregon, Maryland, Michigan and Massachusetts, whereas the Republicans could count on states like Mississippi, Alabama, Kansas and Idaho. States that are teetering between between parties are called \"swing states.\" In the past four election cycles, Ohio and Florida have been swing states, twice providing electoral votes for a Democratic candidate, and twice providing electoral votes for a Republican candidate. Think about it. Do you live in a safe state? If so, is it a Democratic or Republican safe state? Do you live in a swing state? Are your neighboring states swing or safe? Is the population in your state increasing or decreasing?

Wrong! You've just unleashed a flesh-eating zombie. Nouns made from other parts of speech are called nominalizations. Academics love them. So do lawyers, bureaucrats, business writers. I call them zombie nouns, because they consume the living. They cannibalize active verbs, they suck the lifeblood from adjectives, and they substitute abstract entities for human beings. Here's an example. \"The proliferation of nominalizations in a discursive formation may be an indication of a tendency towards pomposity and abstraction.\" Huh? This sentence contains no fewer than seven nominalizations, yet it fails to tell us who is doing what. When we eliminate, or reanimate, most of the zombie nouns, so \"tendency\" becomes \"tend,\" \"abstraction\" becomes \"abstract,\" then we add a human subject and some active verbs, the sentence springs back to life. \"Writers who overload their sentences with nominalizations tend to sound pompous and abstract.\" Only one zombie noun -- the key word \"nominalizations\" -- has been allowed to remain standing. At their best, nominalizations help us express complex ideas, perception, intelligence, epistemology. At their worst, they impede clear communication. To get a feeling for how zombie nouns work, release a few of them into a lively sentence and watch them sap all its energy. George Orwell played this game in his essay \"Politics in the English Language.\" He started with a well-known verse from the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible. It says \"I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.\" Now here's Orwell's modern English version. \"Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.\" The Bible passage speaks to our senses and emotions with concrete nouns, descriptions of people, and punchy, abstract nouns such as \"race,\" \"battle,\" \"riches,\" \"time,\" \"chance.\" Not a zombie among them. Orwell's satirical translation, on the other hand, is teeming with nominalizations and other vague abstractions. The zombies have taken over, and the humans have fled the village. Zombie nouns do their worst damage when they gather in jargon-generating packs and swallow every noun, verb and adjective in sight. So \"globe\" becomes \"global,\" becomes \"globalize,\" becomes \"globalization.\" The grandfather of all nominalizations, antidisestablishmentarianism, contains at least two verbs, three adjectives, and six other nouns inside its distended belly. A paragraph heavily populated by nominalizations will send your readers straight to sleep. Rescue them from the zombie apocalypse with vigorous verb-driven sentences that are concrete and clearly structured.

But even though they're a bit, well, old, these first 10 amendments are still\nthe most debated and discussed section of our Constitution today. So, can you remember what they are? Let's take a look. The First Amendment\nis the freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly and petition. This may be the most revered\nof the amendments. The First Amendment protects our rights\nto say and write our opinions, worship how we please,\nassemble together peacefully and petition our government,\nif we feel the need. The Second Amendment\nis the right to bear arms. The original intent\nof the Second Amendment was to protect colonists\nfrom the invading British soldiers, but it now guarantees\nthat you have the right to own a gun to defend\nyourself and your property. The Third Amendment is called\nthe \"Quartering\" amendment. It was written in response\nto the British occupation, and as a result of the colonists\nhaving to house -- or quarter -- soldiers in their homes\nduring the American Revolution. Because of this amendment, our government can never force us\nto house soldiers in our home. The Fourth Amendment\nis the right to search and seizure. The police can't come into our home\nwithout a search warrant and take our personal property. Today, many concerns have arisen\nabout our rights to privacy in technology. For example, can the government track\nyour location with your smartphone, or can social media postings\nsuch as on Facebook and Twitter be used without a warrant? On to the Fifth:\nIt's all about due process. You've probably heard the phrase\n\"I plead the Fifth\" in movies or on TV. They're talking about the Fifth Amendment, which says that you don't have to take\nthe witness stand against yourself if you may end up incriminating yourself. OK, we're halfway done. The Sixth and Seventh Amendments\nare about how the legal system works. If you're accused of a crime, you have the right to a speedy\npublic trial and an impartial jury. You also have the right to a lawyer, and the right to take\nthe stand if you choose. This is important because it will prevent\nthe accused from sitting in prison forever and insists that the prosecution\nproceed with undue delay. The Seventh says you have\nthe right to a jury trial, where 12 impartial peers decide\nyour innocence or guilt in the courtroom, as opposed to a judge doing it all alone. The Eight Amendment prohibits\ncruel and unusual punishment. Is the death penalty cruel? Is it unusual? It's hard for Americans to agree\non the definitions of cruel and unusual. The Ninth and Tenth Amendments\nare called the non-rights amendments. They say that the rights\nnot listed in the Bill of Rights are retained by the people in the states. We have other rights\nthat are not listed in the Constitution, and the states have the right\nto make their own policies, like instituting state taxes. So now you know all 10 amendments. Can you remember them all?

We're visiting ancient Rome\nto watch the Liberalia, an annual festival that celebrates\nthe liberty of Rome's citizens. We're looking in at a 17-year-old\nnamed Lucius Popidius Secundus. He's not from a poor family, but he lives\nin the region known as the Subura, a poorer neighborhood in Rome,\nyet close to the center of the city. (Gong) The tenants of these\napartments are crammed in, (Grunting) which poses considerable risk. Fires are frequent and the smell of ash\nand smoke in the morning is not uncommon. Lucius, who awoke at dawn,\nhas family duties to perform today. (Cheering) His 15-year-old brother is coming of age. Half the children in ancient Rome\ndie before they reach adulthood, so this is a particularly\nimportant milestone. Lucius watches his brother\nstand in his new toga before the household shrine\nwith its protective deities, as he places his bulla,\na protective amulet, in the shrine with a prayer of thanks. The bulla had worked.\nIt had protected him. Unlike many others,\nhe had survived to become an adult. At 17, Lucius has almost\ncompleted his education. He has learned to speak well,\nmake public speeches, and how to read and write\nboth Latin and Greek. His father has taught him\nthe types of things you can't learn in the classroom: how to run, how to swim, and how to fight. Lucius could choose, at 17,\nto become a military tribune and command soldiers\non the edge of the Empire. But in other ways,\nLucius is still a child. He's not trusted\nto arrange business deals. His father will take care\nof that until he is 25. And Dad will arrange Lucius' marriage\nto a girl 10 years younger. His dad has his eye on a family\nwith a 7-year-old daughter. Back to the Liberalia. As Lucius leaves with his family, the shops are open as the population\ngoes about its business. The streets are full\nof itinerant traders selling trinkets and people bustling from place to place. Large wagons are not allowed\nin the city until after the ninth hour but the streets are still crowded. Fathers and uncles\ntake the kids to the Forum Augustus to see statues of Rome's famous warriors like Aeneas, who led Rome's ancestors,\nthe Trojans, to Italy. And Romulus, Rome's founder. And all the great generals of the Republic\nfrom more than 100 years earlier. Lovingly, we can imagine\nfathers and guardians with their now adult children remembering stories of Rome's glory and re-telling the good deeds and sayings\nof the great men of the past: lessons on how to live well, and to overcome the follies of youth. There is a sense of history in this place,\nrelevant to their present. Romans made an empire\nwithout end in time and space. (Thump) Rome was destined to be\neternal through warfare. Wars were a fact of life, even in A.D. 73. There are campaigns in the north\nof England and into Scotland, to the north of the River\nDanube into Romania, and on the frontier\nbetween Syria and Iraq to the east. It's now the eighth hour --\ntime to head for the baths. Lucius and his family head up\nthe Via Lata, the wide street, to the Campus Martius,\nand the enormous Baths of Agrippa. The family members leave\nthe clients and freedmen outside, and enter the baths with their peer group. Baths would change from dark,\nsteamy rooms to light ones. The Romans had perfected window glass. Everyone moves from the cold room to the tepid room and to the very hot room. (Man) Oops! More than an hour later, the bathers leave massaged, oiled, (Whistling) and have been scraped down with a strigil to remove the remaining dirt. At the ninth hour, seven hours\nafter they left home, the men return for a celebratory dinner. Dinner is an intimate affair, with nine people\nreclining around the low table. Slaves attend to their every need if the diners, through gestures,\ndemand more food and wine. As the day closes, we can hear\nthe rumble of wagons outside. The clients and freedmen, with a meal of robust\n-- if inferior -- food inside them, shuffle off to the now tepid baths before returning\nto their apartment blocks. Back at Lucius' house,\nthe drinking continues into the night. Lucius and his stepbrother\ndon't look too well. A slave stands by in case\neither of them needs to vomit. With hindsight, we know Lucius' future. In 20 years' time, the Emperor Vespasian's\nyoungest son, Domitian, as emperor, will enact a reign of terror. Will Lucius survive?

I've snuck into minutephysics' studio to explain\nhow a wing actually works Hang on, something doesn't feel right. Ah, that's better. Now everyone knows that a wing generates lift\ndue to its characteristic shape Since air travels farther over top of the\nwing, it must go faster than the air underneath so that both streams meet up simultaneously\nat the trailing edge And according to Bernoulli's principle, faster\nflowing air exerts less pressure than the slower air beneath the wing\nThis pressure difference creates an upward force -- lift. Job done. Right? Nope\nThis simple explanation taught in many textbooks and classrooms has obvious problems\nLike how could a plane fly upside down? Some planes like the Wright brothers' had\nnearly flat wings. So presumably air would travel the same speed\nover both sides and there would be no lift Plus experiments show that air streams don't\nmeet up at the back of the wing. Air over the top goes significantly faster,\nreaching the trailing edge first. So how does a wing actually generate lift? Well the key is the wing must deflect air\ndownwards This can be achieved using asymmetric or cambered\nair foils Or by increasing the angle of attack\nAir under the wing is deflected down And by the coanda effect\nair above the wing is guided along its surface and down as well\nSince the air is slowed and deflected down by the wing,\nit pushes the wing up and back. Lift, and drag. This is in accordance with Newton's Third\nLaw of Motion But hang on, if you can explain lift only\nusing the deflection of air and Newton's laws, then the Bernoulli explanation must be completely\nwrong Well, no,\nair over the top of the wing does go faster than air beneath, creating a pressure difference\nthat generates lift Then this Newtonian explanation is unnecessary\nrubbish and the original explanation was right! That's not true either. The original explanation incorrectly assumed\nthat air over and under the wing must reconnect at the trailing edge, and there was no mention\nof deflecting air down. Each explanation, done correctly, completely\naccounts for the lift generated by a wing. They're just two different ways of looking\nat the same thing.

science [Music] scrapbook hello and welcome to the naked science scrapbook from the naked scientists this time we're answering the question what is a fungus we're all familiar with the toad stalls you see growing around trees and the yeast we use to make bread but these are only two examples of the diverse Kingdom of fungi there are a group of organisms completely SE separate from animals and plants and they can be unicellular like yeasts or multicellular like the mushrooms you might add to a stir fry let's take a Whistle Stop tour of some of the weird and wonderful groups of fungi and some of the interesting things that they do first of all how do they live fungi are similar to animals in the sense that they are heterotrophs this means that unlike plants they can't make their own organic carbon based compounds instead like us they have to consume them from their environment and fungi absorb the nutrients they need from anything like rotting wood leaf litter that forgotten bag of grapes lurking at the back of the fridge and even the skin between your toes The Fluffy mold you see on a slice of bread is the main body or melium of a fungus the melium is made up of a dense network of thread-like structures called hyy these look a bit like plant roots and they are how fungi take up nutrients but unlike plant roots they actively release into their local environment enzymes and other digestive chemical juices that break up compounds into simpler molecules that the fungal hyy can then take up and these hyal networks operate on a massive scale in fact The Melia of the fungi that produce the Toads you can see in Woodland can extend for hundreds of meters beneath the soil but working on its own is not always enough for a fungus to extract all of the nutrients it needs instead many team up with plants and in some cases without this relationship neither can survive without the other these interactions are known as micor the plant swaps some of the carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis in return for phosphorus magnesium and copper collected by the fungi from the soil around 90% of all families of plants form these sort of micro risal relationships from crops like wheat and barley to Orchid flowers to trees like Birch and Beach it's even been suggested that without their Mutual interactions neither plants nor fungi could have colonized the land so what are toad stores and mushrooms these are the fungal fruiting bodies they release spores that can either germinate on their own to form a new individual by asexual reproduction all the spores

What exactly is gerrymandering? Essentially, it's the process of giving one political party an advantage over another political party by redrawing district lines. It's like Democrats trying to gain an advantage over Republicans, or Republicans trying to gain an advantage over Democrats. You see, each party wants to gain as many districts as possible so they can do things like control the state budget, or set themselves up to win even more districts in the future. So to understand how this process began, and how it continues today, we must go back to 1812 in Massachusetts.  Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts, supported and signed a bill to allow redistricting. That is, redrawing the boundaries that separate districts. The catch? The new lines would favor Gerry's own political party, the Democratic-Republican party, which no longer exists. You see, Gerry wanted his party to win as many state Senate seats as possible. The more members of your party who vote, the more likely you are to win an election. The new lines were drawn to include loads of areas that would help Governor Gerry in the future. They were so strange looking that someone said the new districts looked like a salamander. The Boston Gazette added Gerry's name to the word salamander, and voilà! Gerrymandering, the process of dividing up and redrawing districts to give your political party an advantage. So how exactly does someone go about protecting their own political party, and actually gerrymandering a district? There are two successful practices. Packing a district, and cracking a district. Packing is the process of drawing district lines and packing in your opponents like cattle, into as few districts as possible. If more districts equals more votes, the fewer the districts there are, the fewer votes the opposition party will get. Packing, then, decreases the opponent's voter strength and influence. Cracking is the opposite: taking one district and cracking it into several pieces. This is usually done in districts where your opponent has many supporters. Cracking spreads these supporters out among many districts, denying your opponent a lot of votes. When you have a large number of people who would generally vote for one type of party, those folks are known as a voting bloc. Cracking is a way to break that all up. So when would a party choose to pack their opponent's districts rather than crack them? Well, that really depends on what the party needs. To dilute your opponent's voters, you could pack them into one district and leave the surrounding districts filled with voters of your own party. Or, if you and your party are in power when it's time to redraw district lines, you could redraw districts and crack up a powerful district and spread your opponent's voters out across several neighboring districts. So, Governor Gerry in 1812 wanted to gain an advantage for his party, and redrew district lines in his state in such a crazy way we have a whole new word and way of thinking about how political parties can gain advantages over their opponents. Politicians think of creative ways to draw districts every few years. So the next time an election comes around, and politicians ask people to vote, be sure to look up the shape of your district and the districts that surround it. How wide does your district stretch across your state? Are all of the districts in your state relatively the same shape? How many other districts does your district touch? But always be sure to ask yourself, does my district look like a salamander?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What exactly is gerrymandering?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Basically, it's finding fault in the incumbent."}, {"label": "B", "text": "First of all, it's a theory with no practical realizations."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Literally, it's when \"gerries\" (or political lobbyists) meander through the opposing party's fundraising initiatives."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Essentially, it's the process of giving one political party the advantage over another political party."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Who was the governor of Massachusetts in 1812?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gerry Blackburn"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elbridge Gerry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gerry Thomas"}, {"label": "D", "text": "James Clinton Tompkins"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What word was added to the Massachusetts governor's name to make the word gerrymandering?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Meander"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Neandrathal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Salamander"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Offender"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What are the two successful practices for effective gerrymandering?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Packing a district"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cracking a district"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stacking a district"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both A and B"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both B and C"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "If more districts equals more votes, the fewer the districts there are:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The fewer votes the opposition party will get."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The more votes the opposition party will get."}, {"label": "C", "text": "the less it matters how many people vote in any district."}, {"label": "D", "text": "the fewer votes both parties will get."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

You know, I've been thinking. Why is this thing so angry? Doctor 2: Maybe he's just hungry. D1: (Laughs) I'm not going in there to feed it. No, this seems like something very primal. D2: This is kind of a hard one, because we don't really have any biological definitions for emotions like anger. Sure, brain imaging studies have shown that some brain regions are more active when people are angry, but these are almost always correlational. When it's warmer outside, people wear less clothing, but if I strip down to my birthday suit, it doesn't make it sunny. D1: (Laughs) It's like having someone run on a treadmill and saying \"Look at how much more his arms move when he runs faster! The arms must be where running happens.\" D2: That's why working with people with brain lesions is so important to neuroscience. It adds some causal evidence that a brain area might be required for a behavior. Same with brain simulation studies. If stimulating a brain area causes a behavior, then that's good evidence that the brain region is involved in that behavior. So like studies with cats in the 1950s showed that stimulating a small almond-shaped area deep in the brain called the amygdala leads to aggressive or predatory behaviors. These things look pretty aggressive to me. D1: Right. But other studies have shown that stimulating different parts of the amygdala can actually suppress predatory behaviors. So it's kind of a complicated little brain structure. D2: Yeah. And fMRI studies have found that the amygdala is active in violent criminals. D1: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful there. Just because criminals have the same active brain regions as people who are angry, doesn't mean that they're inherently aggressive. That's like saying because I kiss with the same face hole that I use to burp, then these two things are related. It's a false equivalence. D2: Huh! Never thought of it like that. That's a good point. D1: You know, the amygdala is part of the Papez circuit. This system was discovered by James Papez, who used the rabies virus to lesion different areas in the cat's brain. He found that the amygdala was physically connected to another region called the hippocampus -- a little seahorse-shaped area that is needed to turn short-term memories into long-term memories. It's thought that this connection between the amygdala and hippocampus links emotion and memory together, so that you remember really emotional stuff better than boring everyday things. D2: Yeah, like Patient H.M. In the 1950s, surgeons removed both his left and right hippocampuses to treat his epilepsy. But after the surgery, he couldn't remember any new information for longer than a few minutes. Zombies appear to be pretty forgetful, wouldn't you agree? D1: (Laughs) Absolutely. Between the amygdala-related aggression, and memory deficits from the hippocampus, Papez may have actually accidentally created the first zombie cat. D2: Aw, come on now, let's not get carried away. But now we do have some testable hypotheses. I'd put money on its aggression and memory problems being linked to abnormalities in its amygdala and hippocampus, respectively. D1: Great! So all we need to do now is figure out how to experimentally test this. Do you think it'll let us examine its brain to verify our hypothesis? D2: Uh, you know, I think I might be more comfortable not knowing the answer to this one. D1: Hmm.

The Revolutionary War has been over for only six years, and the young United States is still struggling in its infancy. Uprisings, boundary disputes and the lack of a common vision all plague the newborn country. In an effort to steady this precarious ship, the Confederation Congress calls on states to send delegates to the grand Convention, to begin on May 14 in Philadelphia. The delegates must draft revisions to the Articles of Confederation, which would then be considered by the Congress and approved by the states. Under the terms of the Articles, all 13 states had to agree to any changes. Since the purpose of the Convention is just to make recommendations, not everyone is excited about attending, and frankly, some think it's a waste of time. As men from different parts of the country began to travel down dusty, rugged roads on the way to Philadelphia, not all states send delegates. In fact, Rhode Island never even shows up. On May 14th, only 8 delegates -- not states, but individual delegates -- are present, so they wait. Finally, on May 25th, the necessary quorum of seven states is acheived. In all, 55 delegates arrive in Philadelphia over the course of the Convention. They are all white males, property owners, and the average age is about 44. Some are slaveholders, some had signed the Declaration of Independence, [James Madison, Roger Sherman] and almost all are well-educated. [Benjamin Franklin] Picture the delegates, James Madison and George Washington among them, sitting in Independence Hall in hot, humid Philadelphia. They're all wearing the dress of the day: frock coats, high collars and thick pants. They vote to keep their discussions secret to encourage honest debate. But that means the windows are closed, and there is no air conditioning in 1787, not even an electric fan. and they'll sit in that sweltering heat, in those heavy clothes, for three months. Shockingly, they all keep their vow of secrecy. That could never happen today, not even for an hour-long meeting. Someone would share \"James Madison thinks he's so smart. Keyword: articles are dead\" via social media, and the whole thing would be a disaster. But in 1787, there are no leaks. Not even a drip that hints at what they are doing. And what they are doing is nothing short of overthrowing the very government that sent them there. Within a few days, with only a seven-state quorum, and only six of those states agreeing, a handful of men change the course of history. They vote to get rid of the Articles of Confederation, and write a new, more nationalistic document that becomes our Constitution. The risk is immense. Everyone on the outside assumes they were working on recommended revisions to the Articles. It's an incredible gamble, and even when the Convention presents the signed Constitution on September 17th, not all delegates endorse it. The country will argue and debate for two more years before the document is adopted by the required nine out of 13 states.

Doctor 2: Well, it’s my professional \nopinion that the large gaping bite mark on its shoulder might have something \nto do with it. D1: Thanks. I mean, what causes \nits behavioral abnormalities? D2: Well, we know all behaviors \nare rooted in the brain, so I’d expect that something’s gone \nterribly wrong, probably in there. D1: Thanks again, Doctor Obvious. Let me be more specific. What changes in the brain \nwould have to occur in order to cause this kind of behavior? D2: Hmm. Well, let's see. The first thing I notice is how it moves. Stiff legged, with long, lumbering steps, \nvery slow and awkward. Almost like what you’d see \nin Parkinson’s disease. Maybe something’s wrong \nwith his basal ganglia? Those are a collection of deep brain \nregions that regulate movement, through a neurochemical called dopamine. Although most people think of dopamine \nas the “happy” chemical of the brain, the dopamine-containing neurons \nin the basal ganglia die off in Parkinson’s disease—\nthat’s what causes it. Makes it more and more difficult \nto initiate actions. D1: What? Look again at how it moves. \nStiff legs, long stance. These aren’t Parkinsonian movements; Parkinson’s patients take \nshort, shuffling steps. And the posture’s all wrong. This looks to me like what happens \nwhen the cerebellum is damaged. The cerebellum’s a little cauliflower\nshaped area in the back of your head, but don’t let its size fool you. That little guy contains almost half \nof the neurons in the entire brain. Patients who suffer degeneration \nfrom this region, something called spino-cerebellar ataxia, show a lack of coordination that results\nin stiff legs, wide stance, and a lumbering walk.

This area is physically connected \nto Broca’s area, that you mentioned, by a massive bundle of neurofibers \ncalled the arcuate fasciculus. I hypothesize that this massive bundle \nof connections is completely wiped out in a zombie. It would be like taking \nout the superhighway between two cities. One city that manufactures a product, and the other that ships it \nout to the rest of the world. Without that highway, \nthe product distribution just shuts down.

They surround the modern city of Istanbul, Constantinople as the Romans called it. And for a thousand years, the fate of Europe depended on them. Constantinople was designed to be the center of the world. When the frontiers of the Roman Empire began to crumble in the 4th Century, the capital was moved to the cultured, wealthy, and still stable East. There, at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, the hub of the major trade routes of the ancient world, the Emperor Constantine built his city. This was the city of libraries and universities, 20 times the size of London or Paris at the time. It contained the priceless knowledge of the classical world which was fading in the West. To protect this masterpiece from its many enemies, Constantine's successors built the finest defensive fortifications ever made. The first line of protection was a moat 60 feet wide and 22 feet deep, stretching all four miles from coast to coast. Pipes from inside the city could fill it at the first sight of the enemy, and a short wall protected archers who could fire at the soaked soldiers trying to swim across. Those who were lucky enough to clear the moat had to contend with an unceasing barrage from the 27 foot outer wall above. Arrows, spears, or far worse, Greek fire -- an ancient form of napalm that would ignite on contact and couldn't be extinguished by water -- would rain down on them. Squads of Roman defenders would carry portable flame throwers, spraying anyone trying to climb out of the moat. The terrified victims would leap back, only to find that they still burned underwater. At times, the Romans would also mount siphons onto the ramparts, and launch clay pots full of Greek fire from catapults at an invading army. The front lines would turn into an inferno, making it appear as if the earth itself was on fire. If, by some miracle, the outer wall was compromised, attackers would be faced with the final defense: the great inner wall. These walls were wide enough to have four men ride side by side, allowing troops to be rushed wherever they were needed. Attilla the Hun, destroyer of civilizations, who named himself the Scourge of God, took one look at them and turned around. The Avars battled the walls uselessly til their catapults ran out of rocks. The Turks tried to tunnel under them, but found the foundations too solid. The Arabs tried to starve the city into submission, but ran out of food themselves and had to resort to cannibalism. It took the guns of the modern world to finally bring them down. In 1453, the Turks brought their super weapon: a monster cannon that could fire a 15 hundred pound stone ball over a mile. Together with more than a hundred smaller guns, they kept up a steady bombardment day and night. A section of the old walls collapsed, but even in their death throes they proved formidable. The rubble absorbed the shock of the cannonballs better than the solid wall. It took a month and a half of continuous blasting to finally open a breach. The last Roman Emperor, Constantine the 11th, drew his sword and jumped into the gap to stop the onrushing horde, disappearing into legend. The city was taken, and the Roman Empire finally disappeared. But those broken walls had one last gift. As the survivors fled the doomed city, they brought with them their precious books and their ancient traditions. They traveled west to Italy, reintroduced the Greek language and learning to western Europe, and ignited the Renaissance.

Imagine a machine that could cut 10 hours of work down to one. A machine so efficient that it would free up people to do other things, kind of like the personal computer. But the machine I'm going to tell you about did none of this. In fact, it accomplished just the opposite. In the late 1700s, just as America was getting on its feet as a republic under the new U.S Constitution, slavery was a tragic American fact of life. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both became President while owning slaves, knowing that this peculiar institution contradicted the ideals and principles for which they fought a revolution. But both men believed that slavery was going to die out as the 19th century dawned, They were, of course, tragically mistaken. The reason was an invention, a machine they probably told you about in elementary school: Mr. Eli Whitney's cotton gin. A Yale graduate, 28-year-old Whitney had come to South Carolina to work as a tutor in 1793. Supposedly he was told by some local planters about the difficulty of cleaning cotton. Separating the seeds from the cotton lint was tedious and time consuming. Working by hand, a slave could clean about a pound of cotton a day. But the Industrial Revolution was underway, and the demand was increasing. Large mills in Great Britain and New England were hungry for cotton to mass produce cloth. As the story was told, Whitney had a \"eureka moment\" and invented the gin, short for engine. The truth is that the cotton gin already existed for centuries in small but inefficient forms. In 1794, Whitney simply improved upon the existing gins and then patented his \"invention\": a small machine that employed a set of cones that could separate seeds from lint mechanically, as a crank was turned. With it, a single worker could eventually clean from 300 to one thousand pounds of cotton a day. In 1790, about 3,000 bales of cotton were produced in America each year. A bale was equal to about 500 pounds. By 1801, with the spread of the cotton gin, cotton production grew to 100 thousand bales a year. After the destructions of the War of 1812, production reached 400 thousand bales a year. As America was expanding through the land acquired in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, yearly production exploded to four million bales. Cotton was king. It exceeded the value of all other American products combined, about three fifths of America's economic output. But instead of reducing the need for labor, the cotton gin propelled it, as more slaves were needed to plant and harvest king cotton. The cotton gin and the demand of Northern and English factories re-charted the course of American slavery. In 1790, America's first official census counted nearly 700 thousand slaves. By 1810, two years after the slave trade was banned in America, the number had shot up to more than one million. During the next 50 years, that number exploded to nearly four million slaves in 1860, the eve of the Civil War. As for Whitney, he suffered the fate of many an inventor. Despite his patent, other planters easily built copies of his machine, or made improvements of their own. You might say his design was pirated. Whitney made very little money from the device that transformed America. But to the bigger picture, and the larger questions. What should we make of the cotton gin? History has proven that inventions can be double-edged swords. They often carry unintended consequences. The factories of the Industrial Revolution spurred innovation and an economic boom in America. But they also depended on child labor, and led to tragedies like the Triangle Shirtwaist fire that killed more than 100 women in 1911. Disposable diapers made life easy for parents, but they killed off diaper delivery services. And do we want landfills overwhelmed by dirty diapers? And of course, Einstein's extraordinary equation opened a world of possibilities. But what if one of them is Hiroshima?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the “peculiar institution\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yale"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The U.S. Constitution"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Slavery"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The American Revolution"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Eli Whitney moved to South Carolina to become", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A dancing instructor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A tutor"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A plantation owner"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A factory owner"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to Davis, a person could clean how much cotton by hand in a day?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "One pound"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ten pounds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "300 pounds"}, {"label": "D", "text": "One bale"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The word “gin” in “cotton gin” means", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Whiskey"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Engine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ginger"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ginseng"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Before the cotton gin was widely available, the American slave population was 700,000 in 1790.
