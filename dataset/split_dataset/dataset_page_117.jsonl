You are to administer the tournament. First, you and you alone will determine\nhow many events there will be and their scoring system. Then the three wizards will\nenter your maze and compete in your chosen\nevents in utmost secrecy; only you and they will see what happens. The competition begins and... Wow, that was one for the record books. The winner was... wait, you have no idea. The last thing you remember was\na dark wizard showing up and casting a forgetting curse. The competitors seem even more confused—\neach is convinced they won. This is bad. There can be no do-overs, and the last failure to declare a winner\nset off the first Great Wizarding War. You’ve got to figure this out— and fast. But for the life of you,\nyou can’t remember a thing. You know you had to follow a few rules: there had to be three or more events,\neach with a single winner and loser. Every event used the same scoring system, where first place received more points\nthan second, and second more than third. All points were positive integers. Maybe there’s a record somewhere...\noh, of course, your scorecard. Well, that leaves something to be desired. All that you wrote down was\nthat in Calchemy, Newt-niz won,\nLeib-ton took second, and that was the only time\nMagnificent Marigold’s Magical Macademy got third all day. Oh, and some final scores: one school got 22 points,\nand both of the others got 9. Why are you so bad at taking notes?! No time for self-recrimination. The wizarding world is waiting. Who won the tournament? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 At first, it may seem like there are\nan overwhelming number of possible scoring systems, so let's see if we can narrow our options. We can start by looking for clues\nin the total scores. Every event was scored the same way, so the sum of all points\nin the entire tournament must be a multiple of one event’s total. In other words, if there were three events\nthat scored 3, 2, 1, which adds up to 6,\nthe total points for the day would be 18, which is three events times 6 points. Our total is 40. So we can make a table of possibilities:\none event totaling 40 points, two totaling 20, four totaling 10,\nand so on. We know there were at least three events,\nwhich eliminates these options, and we can also get rid of events\nwith fewer than 6 points, because the smallest possible total\nis 3 plus 2 plus 1. That leaves two prospects. Let’s try to narrow those further\nby breaking down the possible points earned in each event: if first place received 7 points, the teams that had totals of 9\ncouldn’t have won an event because their total score\nwould be 10 or more. That means the team with 22\nwould have to have won all four. But then their total would be 28,\nso we can eliminate that option. And with four events, these numbers\ncan't be made to add up to 22. Finally, if first place got 5 points, the highest possible score \nwith four events would be 20, getting rid of these two as well. In fact, five events scoring 4 each\ncould only reach 20 as well. That leaves us with just one possibility: five events each scored 5, 2, 1. There’s exactly one way to make\nthose scores add up to 22: the winner finished first\nfour times and second once. The scores of 9 mean one team won once\nand lost four times, and the other lost once\nand took second four times. That must be Marigold’s Macademy, whose only third place finish\nwas Calchemy based on your note. And Leib-ton’s second place finish\nin Calchemy means they scored 22 and won the Sly Wizard Tournament. You have just enough evidence to prove it,\nkeep your job, and avert war.

It is also true. The world's most important\nadvanced technology is nearly all produced\nin a single facility. What's more, that facility is located in one of the most geopolitically\nfraught areas on Earth, an area in which many analysts believe\nthat war is inevitable within the decade. The future of artificial intelligence\nhangs in the balance. The Taiwan Semiconductor\nManufacturing Company, or TSMC, makes all of the world's\nmost-advanced AI chips. This includes Nvidia's GPUs,\nGoogle's TPUs, AMD's GPUs, the AI chips for Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Cerebrus, SambaNova and every other credible competitor. Modern artificial intelligence\nsimply would not be possible without these highly specialized chips. Little wonder, then, that Time magazine recently\ndescribed TSMC as, \"The world's most important company\nthat you've probably never heard of.\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\nput it more colorfully, saying, “Basically,\nthere is air ... and TSMC.” (Laughter) TSMC's chip fabrication\nfacilities, or fabs, the buildings where chips\nare physically built, is located on the western coast of Taiwan, a mere 110 miles from mainland China. In this map, Taiwan is shown in orange\nand China is shown in green. Today, China and Taiwan\nare nearer to the brink of war than they have been in decades. Many policymakers in Washington predict\nthat China will invade Taiwan within the next five years. A China-Taiwan conflict\nwould be devastating for many reasons. Aside from the heavy human toll, one underappreciated consequence is that it would paralyze\nthe global AI ecosystem. Put simply, the entire field\nof artificial intelligence faces an astonishingly precarious\nsingle point of failure in Taiwan. Amid all of the fervor around AI today, this fact is not widely\nenough appreciated. If you are working on\nor are interested in AI, you need to be paying attention. How did we get here\nand what can we do about it? Let's start with a brief, whirlwind\noverview of the chip industry. Semiconductors, or chips,\nare the most complex object in the world that humanity knows how to mass-produce. Making semiconductors requires\nthe world's purest metals, the world's most expensive machinery, legions of highly specialized engineers and atom-level manufacturing precision. It is important to distinguish between two\ndifferent types of chip companies. First, fabless chip makers, which design but do not\nmanufacture their own chips. And second, foundries, which manufacture chips\ndesigned by other companies. Almost every well-known chip\ncompany today is fabless, from Nvidia to AMD to Qualcomm. These companies do not\nproduce their own chips. Instead, they design chips, and then they rely on foundries like TSMC to actually manufacture\nthose chips for them. There are only three companies\nin the world today that are capable of manufacturing chips anywhere near the leading edge\nof semiconductor technology: TSMC, Samsung and Intel. Of those three, only one can reliably produce\nthe world's most advanced AI chips, including chips like Nvidia's H100 GPUs. That one company is TSMC. As of this morning, TSMC's market capitalization\nwas 470 billion dollars, making it the 13th-largest\ncompany in the world, larger than ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase or Walmart. How has TSMC become such a dominant force? The short answer is that powerful\neconomies of scale exist in the world of chip fabrication, leading inexorably\nto winner-take-all dynamics. Making advanced semiconductors\nrequires tremendous upfront and ongoing capital expenditure. In 2021, TSMC announced\nthat it would invest 100 billion dollars over the next three years to continue expanding\nits fabrication capabilities. No other company in the world\ncan justify that level of investment. TSMC can, because of the sheer volume\nof chips that it produces, far more than any other\ncompany in the world. A related dynamic that helps explain\nTSMC's unassailable position is what has come to be known\nas the TSMC Grand Alliance. TSMC has invested heavily over decades to develop deep partnerships\nwith dozens of companies across the semiconductor supply chain, from software providers like Cadence to equipment manufacturers like ASML to chip designers like Nvidia. In turn, these companies\nhave developed their own products in accordance with TSMC's road map, leading to powerful lock-in. In summary, a combination\nof economies of scale, network effects, and unrivaled specialization\nhave made TSMC irreplaceable and have made the entire world deeply,\nprecariously dependent upon it. This brings us to the present,\ndelicate geopolitical moment. Last October, the Biden administration\ntook the dramatic step of banning the export of all high-end\nAI chips to any entity in China. The rationale behind\nthese measures was clear. To leverage US control of the global semiconductor supply chain as a choke point to handicap\nChina's AI capabilities. The US government is currently formulating\nexpansions to this policy. At the same time, the US is taking steps\nto reduce its reliance on chip fabrication facilities\nlocated in East Asia. In late 2022, TSMC announced that it would\ninvest 40 billion dollars to build two new state-of-the-art fabs in the United States, in Arizona. The first of these two fabs is slated\nto begin production in 2025. Bringing advanced\nchip production to US soil will help mitigate the AI industry's\nabsolute dependence on Taiwan-based fabs. But the Arizona fabs\nwill not solve everything. Their production capacity will be modest, representing less than five percent\nof TSMC's total global output. And the most advanced semiconductor\nproduction capabilities and technologies will remain in Taiwan. So where might things go from here? Let's briefly consider\na few possibilities on this three-dimensional chessboard. Let's start with optimistic scenario. Taiwan's central role in the global\nsemiconductor industry is often referred to\nas its “silicon shield.” The basic theory is this: because China depends so heavily on Taiwan\nfor the chips that it needs to keep its own economy running, China will stop short of invading Taiwan\nand putting TSMC's production at risk. And because the rest of the world\nis likewise so dependent on TSMC, the United States and other powers\nwill go to great lengths to protect the island\nand defend its sovereignty. Under this theory, while China may continue\nto build out its military and engage in cross-strait saber-rattling, it will stop short of kinetic\naction against Taiwan. But the silicon shield is just a theory, not a guarantee. What would happen if China\nwere to move decisively to retake Taiwan? TSMC's fabs would almost certainly\nbe rendered inoperative. It is conceivable that the Taiwanese,\nor even the US military, would preemptively destroy the fabs in order to prevent the CCP from taking control of this\nvaluable strategic resource. Even if the physical buildings\nwere to remain undamaged after a Chinese invasion, it is unrealistic that the CCP would be\nable to continue operating the fabs to produce cutting-edge chips. Keeping leading edge fabs running requires ongoing and deep partnership with organizations across the global\nsemiconductor ecosystem, as well as a steady inflow of materials,\nequipment and services. These would be denied\nto an invading power. Let me say this one more time: if or when China invades Taiwan, TSMC's fabs will,\nin all likelihood, go offline. This will mean that no more Nvidia H100s or any other cutting-edge AI chips will be able to be produced\nanywhere in the world. What would this mean for the world of AI? After TSMC, the company\nbest positioned to step up and produce cutting-edge\nAI chips is Samsung. Samsung is currently the only company\nin the world, other than TSMC, that is capable of producing\nthree-nanometer chips, today's cutting-edge technology. But Samsung's production capabilities\nare far inferior to TSMC's today. In a best-case scenario, it would take Samsung years to scale up to TSMC's current AI\nchip yields and volumes. This brings us to America's\nformer chip champion, Intel. It was hardly a decade ago that Intel's chip-manufacturing\ncapabilities were the envy of the world. But in recent years,\nIntel has fallen behind. The company struggled mightily\nin its transition to both ten-nanometer and seven-nanometer node technologies, even resorting to outsourcing some\nof its leading edge production to TSMC. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel aspires to regain\nits chipmaking supremacy with an ambitious plan to leapfrog TSMC and begin producing\ntwo-nanometer chips in 2024. Whether this ambitious plan will actually\nprove achievable, however, remains to be seen. Before we despair too much, let us note a couple encouraging points. First, keep in mind that a considerable\nstock of AI chips already exists in the world. And even in a worst-case scenario,\nthese chips would remain in use. Second, while the most advanced AI chips,\nlike Google’s TPUs or Nvidia’s H100s, can only be manufactured in Taiwan, there are many fabs around the world, from the US to Europe to Israel, that are capable of producing\nlagging-edge logic chips at scale. Though they are far less powerful\nthan today's leading AI chips, these previous-generation chips\ncould be used in a pinch to support some AI computing workloads. Ultimately, though, it would be\ndevastating for humanity to lose its ability to produce the chips that power today's cutting-edge\nartificial intelligence. Progress in AI would be\nprofoundly disrupted. Let us hope that diplomacy prevails.

So you might be surprised to hear that when it comes to the world’s most contagious diseases, those don’t even make the top 10. The winners on that list can be ten or more times as contagious as Ebola or the plague, and they aren’t off in some remote jungle or a thing of the past, either. They’re right here, right now. In fact, measles—that almost-eliminated virus now making headlines in places like Washington and New York— is one of the most contagious diseases we know of. And it’s contagiousness is a big part of why it’s making a resurgence. Now, the word “contagious” has a very specific meaning to epidemiologists —the scientists that study how diseases spread. A disease is considered especially contagious if one sick person is likely to infect a lot of other people. And that’s something that can be quantified. The average number of people a single sick person infects is known as a disease’s basic reproduction number or R0. R0 is based on a number of factors, like the rate of contact between infected and susceptible people how long an infected person is contagious, Probability that an uninfected person will contract the disease if they’re around someone who’s sick. Because of that, it’s not a fixed number— there are a lot of varibles that can impact how contagious a pathogen will be in a specific environment. So contagiousness can vary from location to location and outbreak to outbreak When R0 is less than 1, a disease is considered self limiting. Basically it's not going to spread through a population, and will eventually just die out. When R0 is 1, a disease will kind of hang\naround, but it won't cause an outbreak Above 1, and things start to look bad because the number of infected people increases exponentially To put that in perspective, the most contagious diseases we know of have double or even triple digit R0s That’s why a disease like ebola—which\nhas an R0 between 1.5 and 2.5—can cause epidemics but isn’t considered super contagious. It is very infectious, though. Infectiousness is measured by the infective\ndose— basically, how many virus particles, spores,\nbacterial cells, or other sadistic little vehicles of doom\nit actually takes to make you sick. Ebola is also really deadly. So basically, it’s extra-super terrifying. But if someone in your town has ebola,\nyou could probably hit up the local grocery store\nwithout worrying— that’s not true for really contagious diseases\nlike measles. Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease\nthat was basically eliminated from the United States\nat the turn of this century, but now it’s clawing its way back.\nYay. Measles R0s from previous outbreaks vary a\nlot, from about 5 to several hundred depending\non factors like population density and vaccination status. But taken together, it’s clear that if no\none is vaccinated, then an infected person with measles will likely infect more than\na dozen other people, each of whom can go on to infect another dozen or more people,\nand so on. And it takes vaccination rates above 95% to\npush that R0 to 1 or less to keep it in check. One of the main reasons measles is so contagious\nis that, kind of like ebola, it’s really infectious—it doesn’t take a lot of viruses\nto get you sick. If you are in close contact with someone who\nhas measles and you’re unvaccinated, your chances of getting sick are about 90 percent. Meanwhile, during flu season, you probably\nbreathe in influenza viruses any time you enter an enclosed, public space like an airplane\nor a daycare without getting sick… most of the time. Another big reason it gets around is its route\nof transmission. Measles can go airborne, where it can linger\nfor up to two hours. Theoretically, someone with measles can walk\ninto an elevator, cough, and then two hours later you can walk into the same elevator\nand catch it. You don’t even have to be in the same room at the same time! And measles has a way to ensure a lot of little\ninfectious viruses get into the air with every cough. As they say in real estate, it’s all about\nlocation, location, location. The measles virus makes itself at home in\nyour trachea, at the top of your respiratory system, so it’s in a prime position to come\nout when you cough or sneeze. Other respiratory viruses, like influenza,\nhave to travel much further in order to get out of your body. And Ebola, by comparison, is spread through\nbodily fluids. So you have to come into contact with things\nlike blood, vomit, or feces in order to become infected. Which is much less likely than the elevator\nscenario, though infinitely more disgusting. Also, people with ebola aren’t contagious\nuntil they develop symptoms. So they’re not really likely to wander around during\nthe contagious period when they can spread the infection. People with measles can be contagious up to\nfour days before the characteristic rash develops. So they might think they have a cold, shrug\nit off, and spend days walk around coughing, sneezing, pushing elevator buttons, shaking\nhands, or going to Disneyland, before it even occurs to them they should stay home. This sort of thing happens with other diseases,\ntoo—like the bacterial illness pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Pertussis generally has an R0 of 12 to 17,\nwhich probably has something to do with the fact that adolescents and adults often get\na mild, cold-like version of the disease, or have no symptoms at all. That’s simply not the case with influenza,\nwhich has a low R0 of around 1 or 2. People with the flu are only contagious for about\na day before they develop symptoms. And they’re most contagious when they’re\nthree or four days in—when they’re most likely in bed. One of the only viruses to top measles’\nclaim to contagious fame is rotavirus, the nasty stomach bug that’s most common in\nchildren. It has an average R0 of about 25. And that’s probably because, like measles,\nit’s extremely infectious, but it’s even hardier. It causes explosive diarrhea and is most common\nin children, so, well, you can extrapolate from there how it gets around. Also, the virus is present in an infected\nperson’s feces before they develop symptoms, and it can last hours on unwashed hands, days on some surfaces, and weeks in drinking water. In fact, small kids with questionable hygiene is a common theme when it comes to super-contagious diseases. That certainly helps measles move around schools and daycares, and it’s part of why chickenpox generally has an R0 of 10 to 12. The virus can be passed through the air, but it’s also present inside the pustules that develop, so it can get all over kids’ hands when they scratch those itchy lumps. The virus that causes chickenpox probably doesn’t survive too long outside the human body, though—which is why it doesn’t quite have the legs that measles does. So, in conclusion, you should stockpile beans, rice, and bottled water and never leave your house. Or, you could take reasonable precautions\nagainst contagious diseases. The contagiousness of viruses like measles is a big part of why we’ve developed vaccines against them—because even if they’re not\nas deadly as ebola, they are still deadly. The likelihood someone will die depends a\nlot on where they live — in developed countries like the United States it’s around around\na half a percent, but in developing countries it’s closer to 6%. Unfortunately, some people, like young babies or people with compromised immune systems, aren’t able to get those vaccines. So if you want to help protect everyone around you and stay safe yourself, you can get vaccinated and get your children vaccinated on the recommended\nschedule. And don’t forget to do the usual common\nsense things like wash your hands frequently, and, for the most part, steer clear of other\npeople’s bodily fluids. I mean, you might luck out and stay healthy no matter what. But taking such simple steps can reduce your odds of getting sick.

One day in 1945, Spencer was standing\nnear a RADAR instrument called a magnetron, a device that produced high-intensity\nmicrowaves that could reflect off planes. Suddenly, he noticed that the\ncandy bar in his pocket had melted. He exposed other things to the magnetron\nand, sure enough, popcorn kernels popped, and an egg—well— exploded\nonto a colleague. Soon after, the first microwave oven\nbecame available, operating using the very same technology. So, how does it work? All light energy travels in waves of\noscillating electric and magnetic fields. These oscillations span a range\nof frequencies comprising the electromagnetic spectrum. The higher the frequency,\nthe more energetic. Gamma rays and X-rays\nhave the highest frequencies; microwaves and radio waves,\nthe lowest. Generally, light’s oscillating electric\nfield exerts forces on charged particles, like the electrons in a molecule. When light encounters polar molecules,\nlike water, it can make them rotate, as their positive and negative regions are\npushed and pulled in different directions. The frequency the light is traveling at also determines how it\ninteracts with matter. Microwaves interact strongly with the\nwater molecules found in most foods. Essentially, they make the molecules\njostle against each other, creating frictional heat. Household microwave ovens are\nfitted with cavity magnetrons. When you activate\na microwave oven, a heated element within the magnetron\nejects electrons, and a strong magnet forces them\nto spiral outwards. As they pass over the magnetron’s\nmetallic cavities, the electrons induce\nan oscillating charge, generating a continuous stream\nof electromagnetic microwaves. A metal pipe directs the microwaves\ninto the main food compartment, where they bounce off the metal walls and penetrate a few centimeters\ninto the food inside. When the microwaves encounter\npolar molecules in the food, like water, they make them vibrate\nat high frequencies. This can have interesting effects\ndepending on the food's composition. Oil and sugar absorb fewer\nmicrowaves than water, so if you microwave them alone,\nnot much happens. But when microwaves encounter\na marshmallow, they heat the moisture trapped\nwithin its gelatin-sugar matrix, making the hot air expand\nand the marshmallow puff. Butter is essentially a suspension\nof water droplets in fat. When microwaved,\nthe water rapidly vaporizes, making the butter melt quickly—\nand sometimes, a bit violently. So microwaves heat food molecules\nmechanically, through friction— but they don't alter them chemically. Soup heated in the microwave\nis molecularly indistinguishable from soup heated using a stove or oven. The term “microwave radiation”\ncan be alarming. But in physics, radiation simply describes\nany transfer of energy across a gap. High frequency, ionizing radiation\nmay be harmful because it can strip electrons\nfrom molecules, including DNA. However, microwaves aren’t energetic\nenough to alter chemical bonds. And microwave ovens are designed\nto prevent leakage— for safety and efficiency’s sake. Nonetheless, to totally limit exposure, experts recommend simply standing a\nfew feet away when a microwave oven is on. Microwaving metal is dangerous, \nthough, right? Well, it depends. Metals are conductors, meaning their electrons are loosely bound\nto their atoms and move freely in response\nto electric fields. Instead of absorbing microwave radiation, the metal’s electrons concentrate\non the surface, leading to high voltages at sharp edges,\ncorners, and small gaps. This includes areas between the creases\non a sheet of aluminum foil, the prongs of a fork, or a metal object\nand the microwave oven’s metal walls. Sometimes, voltages get high enough\nto strip electrons from the surrounding air molecules. This electrically charged gas, or plasma,\nmay then form lightning-like sparks and grow as it absorbs more microwaves. Once the oven is turned off,\nthe plasma dissipates. But not all metal objects\nspark in the microwave— though they might make things\ncook a little unevenly. In fact, a lot of microwavable packaging\ntakes advantage of this, using a thin metal coating\nto crisp the food’s surface. And overall, as long as it doesn't\napproach the oven's walls, leaving a metal spoon\nin a microwaving bowl of soup should be a pretty uneventful affair. That’s just another neat benefit\nof cooking with RADAR."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following kinds of light is “ionizing radiation” that, even in low doses, can alter chemical bonds and pose health risks?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ultraviolet (UV)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Radiofrequency (RF)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Microwaves "}, {"label": "D", "text": "Visible light "}, {"label": "E", "text": "Infrared (IR)"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The cavity magnetron was a technological breakthrough that enabled the creation of a high-intensity beam of microwaves.

Long ago, the ancestral gods of Fiji,\nknown as kalou vu or simply vu, settled on the Pacific archipelago, each establishing a village\nin a different area. Eventually, they metamorphosed\ninto various forms. Dakuwaqa settled\non resource-rich Cakaudrove and transformed into a shark. But he was unsatisfied. He became proud and greedy,\nand wanted to challenge every vu, establish himself as the mightiest,\nand dominate all of Fiji’s islands. In his quest for power, Dakuwaqa sped\nthrough the waters toward Rewa, where a quick and cunning eel-shaped vu\ntried to stop him in the mouth of a river. Soon, the two were tumbling\nthrough the water, locked in combat. The brawling vu created towering waves, stretching the river further inshore\nand flooding nearby coastal communities. In the end, the eel was no match\nfor Dakuwaqa’s ferocity. After the fight, the Rewa River became\nthe longest and widest in Fiji, which made nearby communities\nespecially prone to flooding. But Dakuwaqa didn’t care\nwhat damage he caused, so long as he remained undefeated.

But one day, Masilaca— perhaps growing\ntired of Dakuwaqa’s proud, selfish ways and the chaos he’d caused\nacross the archipelago— presented a challenge he knew\nDakuwaqa couldn’t resist. Masilaca spoke about a fierce vu\ncalled Rokobakaniceva, who guarded the outer island of Kadavu, and teased that,\nuntil Dakuwaqa defeated them, he couldn’t claim the title\nof strongest vu. Before Masilaca could even finish \ndescribing Rokobakaniceva, Dakuwaqa was jetting through the water\nin the direction of Kadavu. As he came close,\nDakuwaqa saw a giant octopus hovering at the entrance to a reef. The octopus vu, Rokobakaniceva,\ncared greatly for the people of Kadavu and asked Dakuwaqa politely to stay away\nand not intimidate the villagers. Dakuwaqa was only emboldened\nby the request. He showed his imposing teeth\nand lunged forward to attack. But Rokobakaniceva was prepared. With four tentacles, the octopus vu\nremained rooted to a rock on the seafloor and with the remaining four,\ncaptured Dakuwaqa’s body and flipped him over. In this position, his breathing slowed\nand his muscles relaxed. He was paralyzed and powerless in a\nmysterious state called tonic immobility that some sharks assume when flipped over or when the sensitive pores\nof their snout are stimulated. Dakuwaqa was stuck upside down\nand struggling to breathe, and Rokobakaniceva’s tentacles wrapped\ntighter and tighter around his body.

The region had been split in two,\ndisplacing over 10 million residents and leading to riots that saw the deaths\nof roughly 1 million people. Jawaharlal Nehru, \nIndia’s first prime minister, was eager to usher his country\ntowards a brighter, united future. And one of the projects that would prove\nmost essential to realizing this vision was the construction of Chandigarh: a modern metropolis designed to symbolize\n“the nation’s faith in the future.” But the path to Nehru’s futurist city\nwas far from simple. Since money was tight\nfor the burgeoning nation, the project was only able to secure\na budget of 175 million rupees. That’s the modern equivalent\nof roughly 500 million US dollars— which is barely enough to build\na pair of skyscrapers today. The project also had low public support because the plans required the\nfurther displacement of local villages. The government compensated protesting\nresidents with funds to buy new homes. But their agricultural lands would\nstill be overtaken by the new city. Nehru’s plan for unity\nwas off to a rocky start. But the city’s plans were as inspiring\nas they were innovative. In 1949, Nehru commissioned\nAmerican architect Albert Mayer, whose initial designs laid out\ngreen spaces, sectioned neighborhoods, and organized traffic systems. When Mayer left the project\ndue to his business partner’s death, his plans were taken even further\nby renowned French architect Le Corbusier. Known as one of the fathers\nof modern architecture, Le Corbusier prioritized functional\ndesigns devoid of ornamentation. His style championed unornamented concrete\nfor creating efficient structures that prioritized function over decoration. Building on Mayer’s plans, Le Corbusier introduced the metaphor\nof a human body to describe and design\nChandigarh’s urban environment. The head of the city would comprise\nthe main administrative area. Alongside the State Secretariat,\nParliamentary Assembly and High Court, the complex included symbolic structures\nlike the Martyr’s Memorial, dedicated to those who perished fighting\nfor Indian independence. From the head, residents could travel\ndown the city’s circulatory system: a network of roads and pathways\nknown as the 7Vs. These hierarchical roads connected\nChandigarh to other cities while seamlessly linking\nthe sectors within for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. Chandigarh’s heart was Sector 17—\na commercial district housing large shops, offices, a parade ground,\nand the main interstate bus terminal. And the city’s lungs took the form\nof a continuous Leisure Valley. This series of green belts was modeled\nafter the popular garden city concept, which sought to increase green cover and guarantee all residents access\nto fresh air and open space. Taken as a whole, these plans were\nunprecedented, daring, and expensive. Fortunately, Le Corbusier’s streamlined\nmodernist aesthetic helped keep costs low. Most structures were built of brick,\nwhich was left unpainted and unplastered. Even the city’s grandest concrete\nbuildings remain naked to this day. And since the budget couldn’t accommodate\nmechanical heating and cooling systems, Chandigarh was designed\nwith passive cooling and ventilation built into every structure. Other tropical cities employed\nsimilar techniques on a smaller scale, but in Chandigarh every room\nhad direct access to adequate sunlight and ventilation. Overhangs provided shade during the summer\nand let in heat during the winter. And today, the energy efficiency\nof Chandigarh’s many brick buildings has made the city famous\nfor its eco-friendly design. Of course, neither Chandigarh’s\npast nor present is perfect. The hierarchy of housing types\nresulted in segregation between affluent, large households\nand small, denser plots. And the city’s focus on residential\nand government buildings prevented the development\nof other industries. But many other elements of Mayer and\nLe Corbusier’s plans have aged quite well. Thousands of trees and open spaces\nmake it one of India’s greenest cities. And its high quality of life continues\nto make Chandigarh one of the most desirable cities to live\nin the nation.

But when it lands,\nit isn’t on liquefying flesh, but instead on the world’s biggest,\nand perhaps strangest, flower— Rafflesia arnoldii. Rafflesia is a genus of over 30 species found across the tropical forests\nof Southeast Asia. While its smallest representative has\na flower only a few centimeters wide, its biggest weighs seven kilograms\nand spans over a meter wide. And its putrid aroma isn’t the only thing\nthat sets these plants apart— all Rafflesia are parasites. For most of its life, the Rafflesia plant\nexists as an endophyte, a single thin strand of almost uniform\ncells beneath the bark of its host. It strictly infects Tetrastigma, a genus of large vines\nrelated to the grape. Like typical leafy plants, the host\nTetrastigma’s cells contain chloroplasts. These organelles convert\nsunlight into energy and are each equipped with their own DNA. Rafflesia’s plastids, on the other hand,\nappear to have lost their DNA, and with it the ability\nto photosynthesize. This sort of loss is incredibly rare. With no roots and no ability\nto produce its own food, Rafflesia is completely dependent\non its host, siphoning the Tetrastigma’s water\nand nutrients to fuel its own growth. And Rafflesia’s propensity for theft\ndoesn’t end there. Using a process known\nas horizontal gene transfer, or HGT, Rafflesia has stolen quite a bit\nof genetic material from its host and other plants in its habitat. While HGT is well known in bacteria, it has only recently been documented\nin parasitic plants. And scientists are still\ntrying to understand exactly how this DNA transfer happens. Rafflesia appears to utilize several\nof these stolen sequences as if they were their own, transcribing the DNA into RNA\nand then translating it into proteins, which are used in key cellular processes. After living some time embedded\nin the host vine, Rafflesia emerges as a single bud, which then takes several months,\nor even a year, to reach full size. When it opens, its fleshy maroon petals emit several foul-smelling\nsulfur-containing compounds. The evolutionary reason for this odor\nis relatively straightforward: to attract pollinators. For most species of Rafflesia,\nsingle flowers are either male or female. So, to produce a seed, pollen must be transferred\nfrom one flower to the next. The rotten stench is ideal for attracting\ncorpse-loving carrion flies, and the massive size of the flower\nmay help broadcast it through the stagnant rainforest air. A deceived fly will explore\nthe flower’s interior, laying thousands of ill-fated eggs. But during the fly’s visit, the male Rafflesia’s liquid pollen may\nend up on the fly’s back where it dries. If the fly encounters\nan open female Rafflesia flower, the pollen will rehydrate when rubbed\nagainst the flower’s damp stigma, completing cross-pollination. A pollinated Rafflesia flower\ngradually withers and turns black, but this doesn't mean it's dead. Over several months, a fruit forms\nwhich contains thousands of tiny seeds. But what disperses these seeds\nis still debated, with hypotheses ranging\nfrom elephants to rodents to ants. We do know that the seeds have\nan oily appendage called an elaiosome, a structure ants often\nfeed to their larvae. And scientists have even observed\nants carrying Rafflesia seeds. But what happens to the Rafflesia seeds\nonce inside the ant nest remains unclear. In any case, nobody has seen\nRafflesia seeds germinate, or attach to and infect a host root. Because this crucial step of their\ndevelopment is still not fully understood, cultivation of Rafflesia is difficult.

{"page": 117, "lesson": 9, "title": "How does alcohol cause blackouts? - Shannon Odell", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-does-alcohol-cause-blackouts-shannon-odell", "transcript": {"en": "In 1969, Dr. Donald Goodwin gathered\na group of study participants and asked them each to recall the object\nhe'd shown them two minutes prior. The twist? All the participants\nwere very intoxicated. Despite this, most could pay attention\nto the task and correctly name the toy\nthey had just seen. Yet, when Donald asked them to recall\nthat object a mere 30 minutes later, half the participants drew a blank, having “blacked out” the earlier\nmoment entirely. This study illustrates the strange\nand somewhat selective effects alcohol has on the brain. Many intoxicated people can perform\ncomplex tasks like holding a detailed conversation\nor navigating a walk home. Yet for those experiencing what\nis known as a blackout, the memory of these events\nis quickly forgotten. So how does alcohol cause\nthese memory lapses? First, let's identify the culprit. While a single drink often contains\nhundreds of different chemical compounds, ethanol is responsible for alcohol's\neffects on the brain. Ethanol is lightweight and lipophilic, meaning its structure easily dissolves\ninto fats, like those in the membranes\nof the outer blood-brain barrier. Once inside the brain,\nethanol’s unique structure allows it to bind to, interact, and affect\nmany different neuronal receptors, impairing pathways that allow you to make\ncareful decisions, control your impulses, and even manage your motor skills. And the networks that control memory\nseem to be especially sensitive to alcohol’s effects. Typically, information about your\nsurroundings is taken in by your sensory organs\nand sent to the brain. Neurons transfer this information\nto one another via chemical messengers\ncalled neurotransmitters, which are released by one neuron\nand received by receptors at another. When a neurotransmitter\nbinds to a receptor, it unlocks an internal channel,\nallowing small ions to flow into the cell. If enough ions enter the cell,\nthe neuron fires, sending the signal forward. Through this process,\ndifferent regions of the brain can communicate with one another\nin milliseconds, creating our moment-to-moment\nunderstanding of the world. But ethanol interacts with receptors, making it harder for neurons\nto communicate. While compromised, the brain is\nstill able to transfer information, which is why many intoxicated people\nseem somewhat capable of performing basic tasks. In other words, brain function\nis highly impaired, but not completely broken. But memory storage is a different story. The transfer of\nmoment-to-moment understanding to something we can remember\nis thought to depend on a process called long-term potentiation, or LTP. LTP happens throughout the brain, but is especially important\nin learning and memory regions, like the neocortex and the hippocampus. During LTP, the firing of a neuron triggers\nphysical changes to its structure. For example, more receptors may be\nmoved to the cell's surface, making the neuron more sensitive\nto future signaling from its neighbors. These physical changes increase\nthe likelihood that a cell will fire again at that connection, strengthening the wiring between neurons. And through this stronger connection, it's thought that a stable\nmemory is formed. Yet studies suggest that ethanol has\na unique ability to disrupt LTP, blocking the physical changes\nneeded for memory formation. So, while moment-to-moment information\nis encoded and understood, the storage of that information\nis blunted, resulting in a blackout. Of course, not all levels of drinking\nresult in blackouts. They happen when the concentration\nof alcohol in the blood, or BAC, exceeds a certain level,\napproximately 0.16. But there’s no magic number. At slightly lower BACs, brownouts,\nor the spotty memory of events, can occur, as some neurons continue to function\nproperly while others fail. And drinking too much can cause\na person to pass out altogether. Other factors like dehydration level,\ngenetic differences, medications, and even how much you’ve eaten\ncan affect the likelihood of a blackout. And teenagers appear to be\nespecially vulnerable due to the substantial changes\nin brain development during those years. Alcohol’s short-term effects\nusually don’t last longer than the time it takes for their body\nto metabolize it, or about a day.

But that's not the case. So, what were dodos actually like?\nAnd what really caused their downfall? Let's start at their origin. Okay, rewinding more than\n20 million years, some tropical pigeons from Southeast Asia\nvoyaged across the Indian Ocean, perhaps by gradually journeying\nfrom island to island. Eventually, their descendants came to a\nremote archipelago east of Madagascar. Those that settled likely\ndiversified over time. Then, about 8 million years ago, an underwater volcano formed another\nisland on the chain, which would come to be known as Mauritius. Some of the birds populated\nthis new island, too, and down the line,\ndodos emerged as a distinct species. They shared Mauritius with bats, lizards,\ngiant tortoises, and other birds. The closest large predators were held\nback by about 800 kilometers of ocean, so getting murdered was basically\na non-issue. Without the need for defensive\nadaptations, like flight, expending energy on them\nwould have been wasteful. So, as with the kākāpōs of New Zealand\nand the cormorants of the Galápagos, their flight muscles shrank. Dodos probably nested\non the island's forest floor, feasting on fruits and seeds. Reaching just under a meter tall, they were among the island's\nlargest animals. And they were well-adapted\nto their environment, which could fluctuate between extreme dry\nand wet conditions. They also survived some major disruptions. Around 4,300 years ago, a megadrought caused waves\nof mass mortality events on Mauritius. Fresh water grew scarce\nand lakes likely grew saltier and became treacherous traps. This lasted for around 150 years. However, dodos prevailed...\nuntil a few millennia later, when everything changed— quickly. In 1598, Dutch sailors came\nashore on Mauritius, and the island soon became\na welcome stopover for their trade ships. The sailors described natural wonders, including large numbers of birds\ntwice as big as swans and tortoises with shells huge enough\nto fit 10 men. Mauritian animals hadn't evolved\nto fear being hunted by humans, so they were an easy catch. Sailors ate some dodos,\nbut this alone didn't cause their doom. The Dutch sailors came with company. They brought macaques\nthat were probably pets. They released goats and pigs\non the island to establish food sources. And at some point, sailors also\ninadvertently introduced rats. It's thought that goats and pigs grazed\nand rooted through the forest understory, which dodos lived in; pigs, macaques, and rats preyed\non dodo eggs and chicks; and all of them competed with dodos\nfor resources. Dodos were last seen less than a century\nafter Dutch arrival. At the time, people didn't recognize\nthat species could disappear. It wasn't until a century later,\nin the 1790s, that a scientist conclusively demonstrated\nthe concept of extinction. By then, many thought dodos were fake. But discoveries from digs and sparse\nremains helped confirm their existence. Nevertheless, representations of dodos\nwere misleading. One popular natural history text\nof the late 1700s characterized them as stupid,\nvoracious, and grotesque. Once Lewis Carroll included a dodo in \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\"\nin 1865, the birds quickly amassed popularity. But dodos continued being framed as inept,\nclumsy, lazy, and unfit for survival in scholarly works, satirical magazines,\nand children's poems alike. And yet, there's no evidence that dodos\nwere less intelligent than their relatives. The dodo's brain size relative to its body\nwas similar to that of other pigeons. And especially rotund dodo depictions\nare misleading. They may have been inspired by what dodos\nlooked like during mating displays or in captivity— or they were just\npoor artistic renderings. Scientists think dodos were\nfairly muscular birds. All in all, the dodo was, in fact,\na survivor that withstood major natural disasters\nand thrived on its island home. It simply wasn't prepared for a sudden\nonslaught of invasive species. And neither were other\nendemic Mauritian animals, including raven parrots, fruit bats,\nand giant tortoises. In the aftermath, perhaps it was easier\nto declare the dodo's extinction the result of its personal failing\nthan to admit it was a human one."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where did dodos live?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Iceland"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mauritius"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Madagascar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "New Zealand"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What kind of bird is a dodo?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A type of ostrich"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A type of flightless vulture"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A type of flightless pigeon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A fruitbat"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Flying is a quick way to escape from danger.

She lays pinhead-sized eggs\non a wildflower and is off. The first tiny caterpillar\nhatches a few days later. After two weeks living\nwithin a flower bud, he embarks on a high-risk operation\nthat will require infiltrating a densely guarded fortress undercover. He secretes a thread of silk\nand descends to the ground. Here, he's more vulnerable than ever,\nbut he holds still and waits. His descent perfectly coincides\nwith the peak foraging hours of the nearby red ant colony. Soon enough, a worker ant\nencounters the caterpillar. She inspects his cuticle\nwith her sensitive antennae and picks up on key chemical cues\nthat she uses to recognize her kin. This is all part of the\ncaterpillar's disguise. The worker picks him up\nand reverses course. Indeed, the caterpillar doesn't battle\nhis way into the fortress. No— he wouldn't stand a chance. He's shepherded in because the ant is treating him like one\nof her colony's own larvae. They pass legions of ants\npoised to attack invaders and enter the intricately architected,\nsubterranean nest, which is sheltered, moist,\nand stockpiled with resources. If the caterpillar's mimicry didn't work, he might have been left for dead\nor taken as food himself. Instead, the ant places the caterpillar\nin the nursery, among the colony's own cherished brood. Here, he produces sugary secretions\nthat the worker ants feed from. The nurse ants dote upon him, regurgitating food\ninto his mouth frequently. But he has a voracious appetite. He arches his body in a begging\nposture to obtain more food, and, every now and then,\neats one of his own nestmates. The caterpillar also does things\nthat the ant larvae can't: he makes noises that sound a lot\nlike those emitted by the ant queens. In effect, he signals that he's royalty\nand should be prioritized over the actual ant larvae. And that's exactly what happens. The nurse ants feed him extra. And when a wild boar causes part\nof the nest to collapse, the ants rescue the caterpillar first. While members of the ant colony suffer\nreduced survival rates because of the burdensome caterpillar, he passes the harsh winter\nliving like royalty. Come June, he's stored up plenty\nof nutrients to make a dramatic transformation. He forms his chrysalis,\nand for three weeks, he uses a tooth-and-comb organ to create\nmore queen-like acoustic vibrations, attracting workers to clean him. Then, at dawn one day,\nhe emerges an adult butterfly. Wings still wet, his body easily fits\nthrough the gallery opening, and finally,\n11 months after being taken in, he basks in the sun\nand begins searching for a mate. When he dies about a week later, he'll have spent the vast majority\nof his life in the realm of the ants. The Alcon blue is one of as many\nas 200 parasitic butterfly species, all of which target ants. Sometimes, multiple caterpillars inhabit\nthe same ant colony at once. Some stay for almost two years. But researchers are still parsing\nthese complex relationships. For instance, certain ants guard Japanese\noakblue caterpillars from predators and consume the sugary secretions\nthe caterpillars produce in return. But it turns out that this\nsweet concoction isn't a simple form of mutual assistance. Instead, chemicals in the secretions\nactually manipulate the ants' behavior, inhibiting their movement and making them more protective\nand aggressive caterpillar guards. Despite these masterful manipulations, parasitic butterflies are\nvulnerable themselves. They're also the targets of parasitism. Even within their adopted,\nhigh-security hideaways, parasitoid wasps sometimes track\nthe caterpillars down and lay eggs on their bodies. When the wasp larvae hatch,\nthey consume the caterpillars alive. And because their life cycles consist\nof such a complex choreography involving specific plants and ants, small environmental changes can\naffect their populations. One parasitic butterfly species actually\nwent extinct in the UK in 1979, before being reintroduced\na few years later. They've since rebounded alongside\nefforts to restore the meadow habitats their host ants require to thrive— helping preserve these\nriveting relationships and the astonishing adaptations\nthey inspire."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Alcon blue spends the majority of its life cycle as a(n) ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Egg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Larva"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pupa"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Adult"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Complete the sentence: “Alcon larvae ____.”", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Actively enter the ant nest"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Survive in the nests of any species of ant"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Are fed by ant nurses"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pupate outside the ant nest"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Alcon blue parasites achieve high social status within the colony hierarchy by ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Producing sugar secretion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Emitting queen-like sounds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Assuming a begging posture"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Secreting chemical cues"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which sentence about Alcon blue pupae is correct?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are mute."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They sing like ant queens."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They stay in the nest but no longer need ants’ care."}, {"label": "D", "text": "They move out of the nest so the adult is free to fly."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How would you classify the Alcon blue butterfly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An endangered species"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A common species"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A generalist species"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A mutualist species"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Famous philosophers whisper\nadvice in your ear. Utilitarian John Stuart Mill tells you\nthat one should always strive to bring about the greatest happiness\nfor the greatest number of people. Aristotle reminds you of the importance\nof the virtues of generosity and justice. But Thomas Hobbes points out that \"of all voluntary acts,\nthe object is to every man his own good.\" In other words, human beings\nare inherently selfish anyway. So why shouldn't you take\nthe last cupcake for yourself? This is actually one of philosophy's\noldest questions. Not your cupcake dilemma— the question of whether or not\nhuman beings are inherently selfish. The idea that humans only act\nout of self-interest is known as psychological egoism, and there aren't many philosophers\nwho endorse this extreme stance. There's simply too much evidence\nof humans sacrificing their self-interest, and sometimes their very lives,\nfor the sake of others. And studies by psychologists have shown\nthat even very young children demonstrate helpful behavior despite\nthere being nothing in it for themselves. However, the idea that all humans\nhave a deep selfish streak is something many more philosophers\nwould agree with. German philosopher Immanuel Kant noted\nthat while we often seem to act for the sake of others, it's impossible to be sure\nwe're not truly motivated by \"a secret impulse of self-love.\" For example, maybe when people make\nlarge donations to charity, they're actually more interested\nin looking good or benefiting from tax breaks\nthan helping others. It's worth noting that not all \nphilosophers think self-love is always a bad thing. French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau\nidentified two kinds of self-love. He believed \"Amour de soi,\"\nour basic need for self-preservation, is natural and essential. But he identified \"amour propre,\" our toxic desire for recognition\nand social status, as the cause of many unjust disparities. In a similar vein, Aristotle argued\nthat humans are social beings who can only flourish when we seek\nthe good of others as well as ourselves. By this logic, true self-love requires us\nto work against our selfish tendencies. For many philosophers,\nthis is where the real problem lies— how do we overcome our selfishness? Some, like Kant, have argued\nthat our sense of moral duty is what helps us rise\nabove our narrow self-interest. Others, like Rousseau and Adam Smith, contend that emotions\nlike pity and sympathy are what allow us to consider\nthe needs of others. But 20th century philosopher-novelist\nIris Murdoch believed the only true solution\nto human selfishness was love. Or at least,\na certain kind of love. For Murdoch, selfishness isn't about\ntrivial things like taking the last cupcake. It's about seeing the world in a way\nthat casts yourself as a star, and everyone else as secondary characters. To explain this, Murdoch tells the story\nof a discontented mother-in-law. While the mother is always polite, she secretly feels her son made\na mistake marrying his \"vulgar\" and \"tiresomely juvenile\" wife. To Murdoch, this mother\nis the picture of selfishness. By centering her own jealousy\nand insecurity, she's reducing the nuanced reality\nof her daughter-in-law to a caricature. But with some conscious effort, Murdoch believes the mother can learn to\nsee her daughter in law as she truly is— not vulgar or juvenile, but refreshingly straightforward\nand delightfully youthful. To be clear, this doesn't mean the mother should simply don\nrose-colored glasses. Love, as Murdoch defines it,\nis \"the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself\nis real.\" As challenging as this might be, Murdoch believes we can all reach\nthis realization by cultivating what she calls attention. Partially inspired by Buddhist meditation, this practice could include engaging\nwith art, learning foreign languages, or simply taking the time to observe\nthe natural environment. What's important for Murdoch\nis that the behavior helps direct your attention\nbeyond the self. Because only by practicing our ability\nto attend to the world around us can we learn to see it as it truly is."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The view that human beings only act out of self-interest is called ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Utilitarianism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kantianism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Psychological egoism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The genetic fallacy"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "According to French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, \"amour propre\" is ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Our basic need for self-preservation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A toxic desire for recognition and social status"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The most romantic form of love"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The love we have for close family members"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Aristotle believed that true self-love requires us to ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prioritize our own needs over the needs of others"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Spend more time alone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Seek out positions of power and influence"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Work against our selfish tendencies"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "For Iris Murdoch, love means ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Seeing everyone else as secondary characters in your own narrative"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Seeing others as they really are"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Seeing the person you love through rose-colored glasses"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Seeing yourself as special "}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Iris Murdoch believes that engaging with art and learning foreign languages ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Are ways of practicing what she calls “attention”"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Are less important than studying philosophy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Are likely to make you more selfish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Are good ideas for a first date "}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

With generative AI, along with other advances in deep fakery, it doesn't take\nmany seconds of your voice, many images of your face, to fake you, and the realism keeps increasing. I first started working\non deepfakes in 2017, when the threat to our trust\nin information was overhyped, and the big harm, in reality,\nwas falsified sexual images. Now that problem keeps growing,\nharming women and girls worldwide. But also, with advances in generative AI,\nwe're now also approaching a world where it's broadly easier\nto make fake reality, but also to dismiss reality\nas possibly faked. Now, deceptive and malicious\naudiovisual AI is not the root of our societal problems, but it's likely to contribute to them. Audio clones are proliferating\nin a range of electoral contexts. \"Is it, isn't it\" claims cloud\nhuman-rights evidence from war zones, sexual deepfakes target women\nin public and in private, and synthetic avatars\nimpersonate news anchors. I lead WITNESS. We're a human-rights group that helps people use video and technology\nto protect and defend their rights. And for the last five years,\nwe've coordinated a global effort, \"Prepare, Don't Panic,\" around these new ways\nto manipulate and synthesize reality, and on how to fortify the truth of critical frontline journalists\nand human-rights defenders. Now, one element in that\nis a deepfakes rapid-response task force, made up of media-forensics experts and companies who donate\ntheir time and skills to debunk deepfakes\nand claims of deepfakes. The task force recently received\nthree audio clips, from Sudan, West Africa and India. People were claiming that the clips\nwere deepfaked, not real. In the Sudan case, experts used a machine-learning algorithm trained on over a million examples\nof synthetic speech to prove, almost\nwithout a shadow of a doubt, that it was authentic. In the West Africa case, they couldn't reach\na definitive conclusion because of the challenges\nof analyzing audio from Twitter, and with background noise. The third clip was leaked audio\nof a politician from India. Nilesh Christopher of “Rest of World”\nbrought the case to the task force. The experts used almost an hour of samples to develop a personalized model\nof the politician's authentic voice. Despite his loud and fast claims\nthat it was all falsified with AI, experts concluded that it at least\nwas partially real, not AI. As you can see, even experts cannot rapidly\nand conclusively separate true from false, and the ease of calling\n\"that's deepfaked\" on something real is increasing. The future is full of profound challenges, both in protecting the real\nand detecting the fake. We're already seeing the warning signs of this challenge\nof discerning fact from fiction. Audio and video deepfakes\nhave targeted politicians, major political leaders in the EU,\nTurkey and Mexico, and US mayoral candidates. Political ads are incorporating footage\nof events that never happened, and people are sharing\nAI-generated imagery from crisis zones, claiming it to be real. Now, again, this problem\nis not entirely new. The human-rights defenders\nand journalists I work with are used to having\ntheir stories dismissed, and they're used to widespread,\ndeceptive, shallow fakes, videos and images taken\nfrom one context or time or place and claimed as if they're in another, used to share confusion\nand spread disinformation. And of course, we live in a world\nthat is full of partisanship and plentiful confirmation bias. Given all that, the last thing we need\nis a diminishing baseline of the shared, trustworthy information\nupon which democracies thrive, where the specter of AI is used to plausibly believe\nthings you want to believe, and plausibly deny things\nyou want to ignore. But I think there's a way\nwe can prevent that future, if we act now; that if we \"Prepare, Don't Panic,\" we'll kind of make our way\nthrough this somehow. Panic won't serve us well. [It] plays into the hands\nof governments and corporations who will abuse our fears, and into the hands of people\nwho want a fog of confusion and will use AI as an excuse. How many people were taken in,\njust for a minute, by the Pope in his dripped-out\npuffer jacket? You can admit it. (Laughter) More seriously, how many of you know someone\nwho's been scammed by an audio that sounds like their kid? And for those of you\nwho are thinking \"I wasn't taken in, I know how to spot a deepfake,\" any tip you know now is already outdated. Deepfakes didn't blink, they do now. Six-fingered hands were more common\nin deepfake land than real life -- not so much. Technical advances erase\nthose visible and audible clues that we so desperately want to hang on to as proof we can discern real from fake. But it also really shouldn’t be on us\nto make that guess without any help. Between real deepfakes\nand claimed deepfakes, we need big-picture, structural solutions. We need robust foundations that enable us to discern\nauthentic from simulated, tools to fortify the credibility\nof critical voices and images, and powerful detection technology that doesn't raise more doubts\nthan it fixes. There are three steps we need to take\nto get to that future. Step one is to ensure\nthat the detection skills and tools are in the hands\nof the people who need them. I've talked to hundreds of journalists, community leaders\nand human-rights defenders, and they're in the same boat\nas you and me and us. They're listening to the audio,\ntrying to think, \"Can I spot a glitch?\" Looking at the image, saying,\n\"Oh, does that look right or not?\" Or maybe they're going online\nto find a detector. And the detector they find, they don't know whether they're getting\na false positive, a false negative, or a reliable result. Here's an example. I used a detector, which got the Pope\nin the puffer jacket right. But then, when I put in the Easter bunny\nimage that I made for my kids, it said that it was human-generated. This is because of some big challenges\nin deepfake detection. Detection tools often only work\non one single way to make a deepfake, so you need multiple tools, and they don't work well\non low-quality social media content. Confidence score, 0.76-0.87, how do you know whether that's reliable, if you don't know if the underlying\ntechnology is reliable, or whether it works on the manipulation\nthat is being used? And tools to spot an AI manipulation\ndon't spot a manual edit. These tools also won't be\navailable to everyone. There's a trade-off\nbetween security and access, which means if we make them\navailable to anyone, they become useless to everybody, because the people designing\nthe new deception techniques will test them on the publicly\navailable detectors and evade them. But we do need to make sure\nthese are available to the journalists, the community leaders, the election officials, globally,\nwho are our first line of defense, thought through with attention\nto real-world accessibility and use. Though at the best circumstances, detection tools will be\n85 to 95 percent effective, they have to be in the hands\nof that first line of defense, and they're not, right now. So for step one, I've been talking\nabout detection after the fact. Step two -- AI is going to be everywhere\nin our communication, creating, changing, editing. It's not going to be a simple binary\nof \"yes, it's AI\" or \"phew, it's not.\" AI is part of all of our communication, so we need to better understand\nthe recipe of what we're consuming. Some people call this\ncontent provenance and disclosure. Technologists have been building ways\nto add invisible watermarking to AI-generated media. They've also been designing ways -- and I've been part of these efforts -- within a standard called the C2PA, to add cryptographically signed\nmetadata to files. This means data that provides details\nabout the content, cryptographically signed\nin a way that reinforces our trust in that information. It's an updating record\nof how AI was used to create or edit it, where humans and other\ntechnologies were involved, and how it was distributed. It's basically a recipe\nand serving instructions for the mix of AI and human that's in what you're seeing and hearing. And it's a critical part of a new\nAI-infused media literacy. And this actually\nshouldn't sound that crazy. Our communication is moving\nin this direction already. If you're like me -- you can admit it -- you browse your TikTok “For You” page, and you're used to seeing videos\nthat have an audio source, an AI filter, a green screen,\na background, a stitch with another edit. This, in some sense, is the alpha version\nof this transparency in some of the major\nplatforms we use today. It's just that it does not yet travel\nacross the internet, it’s not reliable, updatable, \nand it’s not secure. Now, there are also big challenges in this type of infrastructure\nfor authenticity. As we create these durable signs\nof how AI and human were mixed, that carry across the trajectory\nof how media is made, we need to ensure they don't compromise\nprivacy or backfire globally. We have to get this right. We can't oblige a citizen journalist\nfilming in a repressive context or a satirical maker \nusing novel gen-AI tools to parody the powerful ... to have to disclose their identity\nor personally identifiable information in order to use their camera or ChatGPT. Because it's important they be able\nto retain their ability to have anonymity, at the same time as the tool\nto create is transparent. This needs to be about the how\nof AI-human media making, not the who. This brings me to the final step. None of this works\nwithout a pipeline of responsibility that runs from the foundation models\nand the open-source projects through to the way that is deployed\ninto systems, APIs and apps, to the platforms where we consume\nmedia and communicate. I've spent much of the last 15 years\nfighting, essentially, a rearguard action, like so many of my colleagues\nin the human rights world, against the failures of social media. We can't make those mistakes again\nin this next generation of technology. What this means is that governments need to ensure that within this pipeline\nof responsibility for AI, there is transparency,\naccountability and liability. Without these three steps -- detection for the people who need it most, provenance that is rights-respecting and that pipeline of responsibility, we're going to get stuck looking in vain\nfor the six-fingered hand, or the eyes that don't blink. We need to take these steps. Otherwise, we risk a world\nwhere it gets easier and easier to both fake reality and dismiss reality as potentially faked. And that is a world that the political\nphilosopher Hannah Arendt described in these terms: \"A people that no longer\ncan believe anything cannot make up its own mind. It is deprived not only\nof its capacity to act but also of its capacity\nto think and to judge. And with such a people\nyou can then do what you please.\" That's a world I know none of us want, that I think we can prevent. Thanks. (Cheers and applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

He presided over a golden age\nof Egyptian prosperity. But was he a model leader, or a shameless egomaniac\nand master of propaganda? Order! Order! Who do we have on the stand?\nRamesses II? Ahem, I believe you mean\n\"The strong bull, protector of Egypt, who subdues foreign lands; rich in years, great in victories,\nchosen by Ra— whose justice is powerful— Ramesses, beloved of Amun.\" But you may refer to him\nas Ramesses the Great. Ramesses, Ramesses— \nI think I've heard of him. \"Let my people go!\" Yes, Your Honor, he was the infamously\nstubborn pharaoh of Exodus, who forced enslaved Hebrews to build out his extravagant capital city\nof Pi-Ramesses. Objection, there's no\narchaeological evidence that Ramesses used forced labor\nin his construction projects. Egyptians relied on highly trained\nartisans and craftsmen to build their cities and monuments. And menial labor,\nlike quarrying and moving stones, was done by military soldiers\nand foreign mercenaries— all of whom were compensated\nfor their work. So he's not the pharaoh from Exodus? It's hard to say for certain. According to some timelines, Ramesses is the best candidate\nfor that particular pharaoh. But there's no evidence of any Hebrew\npopulation in Egypt during his reign, and certainly no records of a revolution\nor mass migration like the one described in Exodus. Is that really so surprising? It's not like Ramesses kept records\nof any other time he was defeated. What do you mean? Our \"great\" pharaoh here operated\none of the largest propaganda machines in ancient history. Almost all pharaohs relied on propaganda\nto control their country, and Ramesses had particularly\nbig sandals to fill. His father, Seti I, led Egypt to a period\nof great wealth and stability that Ramesses worked hard to maintain. Through propaganda, yes,\nbut also military glory. More like military aggression. By the end of Seti's reign, he had established peace\nwith the neighboring Hittites by guaranteeing Egyptian control\nover a sought-after region called Kadesh. But in the fifth year of his reign,\nRamesses broke those agreements. It wasn't the most peaceful decision, but Ramesses believed a military victory\nwould aid his efforts to restore Egypt's reputation. And he was right! His victory over the Hittites\ncemented Ramesses' persona as a heroic pharaoh of old. Yeah, except he didn't even win! His supposed victory was\nactually a stalemate in which the pharaoh's arrogance\nalmost cost Egypt the entire war. When two Hittite spies told Ramesses\nthe enemy had fled in fear, he let his guard down,\nallowing his men to be ambushed. He played right into the Hittite's trap\nand almost lost everything. Yet the official story Ramesses\nhad chiseled across Egypt cast himself as the battle's\ngreatest hero. Military achievements were important\nfor legitimizing a pharaoh's power, even if that meant a bit\nof exaggeration. A bit? You can't trust\nanything this guy says! If it wasn't for the Hittite's\nconflicting record, we'd still be buying Ramesses' propaganda. I propose that this court cannot judge\nany historical figure's legacy by the stories they tell about themselves. That seems reasonable to me. Fair enough. How's this record then— the first recorded peace treaty\nin archaeological history signed by Ramesses and the Hittites. \"Peace treaty\" is pretty generous. Ramesses begrudgingly agreed\nto a mutual defense contract, where Egyptians and Hittites would work\ntogether if attacked by an external enemy. And what's wrong with that? This peaceful end to the conflict\nmarked the beginning of Ramesses' prosperous reign— a golden age of Egyptian power and wealth. True, but we have no idea if this wealth\ntrickled down to everyday Egyptians or just financed Ramesses' vain attempts\nto achieve immortality through stone. He spent his entire reign pouring\nmoney into ego projects. And one of the most famous,\nAbu Simbel, wasn't even in Egypt! Abu Simbel was in Nubia to showcase\nEgypt's strength and discourage a Nubian revolution. Besides, pharaohs were expected to invest\nin building projects for the gods. Right, \"for the gods,\"\nwhich Ramesses was not. Pharaohs typically occupied a status\nbetween gods and mortals, but the location of Ramesses' statue\ninside Abu Simbel positions him as their supposed equal. He even tore down existing temples\nto reuse their bricks in monuments to himself! He tore down temples built by Akhenaten, a pharaoh who'd attempted\nto impose monotheism. By destroying those temples, Ramesses reinforced his commitment\nto Egypt's traditional religion. That doesn't account for why he frequently\nerased other pharaohs' names on monuments and replaced them with his own. Hey, what the...? Even pharaohs who had short reigns\nhad numerous statues made of themselves— and Ramesses ruled\nfor almost seven decades. Well, he definitely made\na lasting impression. Let's face it, Your Honor, would we even\nbe talking about him today if he hadn't? It's often said that history is written\nby the winners, but in this courtroom, a winning record never guarantees\nthe outcome."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Ramesses II reigned for almost ____ years.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "30"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50"}, {"label": "C", "text": "70"}, {"label": "D", "text": "90"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the name of Ramesses II’s capital city?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pi-Ramesse"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Memphis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cairo"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Thebes"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Ramesses II fought the Hittites in the famed Battle of ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gaza"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hattuša"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Memphis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Kadesh"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Ramesses II built a famous temple at Abu Simbel in Nubia, which features four huge statues of himself on the façade and is important because ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It uses a new building technique"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It celebrates a new monotheistic religion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It shows Ramesses II as equal to the gods"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is the biggest temple ever built"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Battle of Kadesh ended in a stalemate but is important for leading to the world’s first recorded ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Peace treaty"}, {"label": "B", "text": "List of prisoners"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Empire"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Declaration of war"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Hsu", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-much-would-it-cost-to-buy-the-ocean-astrid-j-hsu", "transcript": {"en": "Surveying his vast domain, \ntrident heavy in hand, Poseidon considers \nthe prospect of retirement. What if someone else donned\nthe coral crown so he could spend his immortality\nharmonizing with blue whales and cozying up to hydrothermal vents? Poseidon decides he needs to actually\nprioritize himself for once. So he summons his accountant and asks: how much could he sell\nthe ocean for today? Poseidon’s accountant is the\ntop-ranked financial analyst to the world’s movers and shakers, its literal titans of industry. He handles all divine assets. When it comes to boiling complex systems\nof intrinsic value down to monetary sums, he’s the guy. And he’s actually got a potential buyer: Hades is interested in building\nhis real estate portfolio and expanding his domain\ninto the marine realm. So, the accountant already appraised\nthe ocean’s market value and prepared a quick presentation. \"The property covers\nover 70% of Earth’s surface. But it’s also quite voluminous!\" Poseidon knows this. He does annual Mariana Trench\nswims with sea cucumbers. But before he even gets\nto his best giant squid story, the accountant is back at analysis. \"Marine shipping alone accounts\nfor 80% of global trade, generating over $14 trillion annually. The global fishing industry \nprovides over 3 billion people with a significant amount \nof their dietary protein, employs an estimated 260 million, and generates about $163 billion\nevery year. And oil and budding\nseabed mining industries generate around $245 billion per year.\" \"Some of the ocean’s assets\nare harder to quantify monetarily. The ocean absorbs around 30%\nof human generated carbon dioxide, and, since 1955, has taken\nin more than 90% of excess heat. About 40% of humanity lives\nwithin 100 kilometers of the ocean. Coastal ecosystems buffer waves,\nreduce erosion, and ease flooding, preventing over $716 billion\nin damages annually. Many cultures have deep ties to the ocean. And coastal views and recreation\nimprove mental health. Meanwhile, it's estimated\nthat as-yet undiscovered marine-derived cancer treatments\ncould save countless lives and be worth up to $5.7 trillion. The ocean generates half\nthe planet’s oxygen and, directly or indirectly, provides food, energy, and minerals\nto all life on Earth.\" A salty tear cascades down Poseidon’s face\nthat the accountant ignores. He can’t give the total cost yet\nbecause, of course, recent developments must be factored in. \"Climate change is heating, acidifying,\nand deoxygenating the ocean and trash is polluting it. Overfishing and aggressive \nseabed resource extraction are disrupting fragile ecosystems\nand impacting the ocean’s productivity.\" The accountant says, \"Sigh, buddy,\nyou shouldn’t worry, though, because we can grow\nthe ocean’s investment value. Coral reef tourism already yields\napproximately $36 billion annually. Considering the revenue\nof popular dive sites and their regional shark\npopulations and lifespans, researchers estimate that one shark can\ngenerate almost $2 million in its lifetime— making them much more valuable\nalive than dead. Sustainable management of fisheries\ncould allow species to rebound and bring in an additional\n$83 billion annually. And with growth in offshore wind, \ntidal, and wave energy harvesting, the ocean is poised to help\nhumanity quit fossil fuels.\" Now the grand reveal. The accountant's conclusions are similar\nto those of mortal experts: the ocean alone is worth\nroughly $24 trillion— at least— about a quarter\nof the World Bank’s valuation of the global economy in 2021. But if humanity reinvests\nin the ocean's health— fishing sustainably,\ndecarbonizing shipping, scaling offshore wind farms,\nand conserving and restoring mangroves— investments could return\nup to 600% in profits. Poseidon feels the weight of his folly\ncrushing him like a Styrofoam cup 2,000 meters deep. Reducing such a priceless, generously\nlife-giving natural system to a number is just another symptom of the greatest\nproblems he’s facing nowadays. And though he respects the work\nhis brother, Hades, does, he doesn't want the ocean to become\nan extension of the Underworld. He can’t give it up. Poseidon asks forgiveness and reaffirms his eternal vow\nto protect the ocean. It’ll take him a few tidal cycles\nto realize Hades and the accountant were bluffing \nand see what this really was: a much-needed intervention by a duo\nof deities who cared deeply about him— and the world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Maritime shipping accounts for ____ of global trade.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "20%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "40%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "60%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "80%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not listed as a major threat to the ocean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Climate change"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pollution"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tourism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Overfishing"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which activities help grow the ocean’s value?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Renewable energies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Coastal habitat conservation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sustainable fishery management"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "True or False: The global fishing industry is responsible for supplying 3 billion people with protein, employing 260 million people, and generating 163 billion dollars.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The ocean absorbs around ___ of human-generated carbon dioxide and has taken in more than ___ of excess heat.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50%, 90%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "30%, 90%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "90%, 50%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "50%, 30%"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The ocean supplies ___ of our oxygen.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "30%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "70%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "90%"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 117, "lesson": 16, "title": "Why is rice so popular? - Carolyn Beans", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-is-rice-so-popular-carolyn-beans", "transcript": {"en": "If you were to place all the rice consumed\neach year on one side of a scale, and every person in the world\non the other, the scale would tip heavily\ntowards rice's favor. This beloved crop contributes over 20% of\nthe calories consumed by humans each year. Korean bibimbap, Nigerian jollof,\nIndian biryani, Spanish paella, and countless other culinary masterpieces\nall begin with rice. So how did this humble grain\nend up in so many cuisines? The roots of rice go back thousands\nof years to when early farmers in Asia, Africa, and South America\neach independently domesticated the crop. First came Asian rice, which many plant geneticists believe\noriginated in what's now China. Over 10,000 years ago,\nnomadic hunters in the region began gathering and eating seeds\nfrom a weedy grass. Then, around 9,000 years ago,\nthey started planting these seeds, prompting nomadic hunters to settle\ninto farming communities. With each harvest, growers selected\nand replanted seeds from the rice plants\nthat pleased them most— like those with bigger and more plentiful\ngrains or aromatic flavors. Over millennia, thousands of varieties\nof Asian rice emerged. A relative of the same weedy grass\nwas also domesticated in Africa around 3,000 years ago. Today, its growth is mostly limited\nto West Africa. South American growers also domesticated\nrice around 4,000 years ago, though the crop was lost\nafter the arrival of Europeans. Asian rice, however, spread widely, and is now a cornerstone of diet\nand culture in Asia and beyond. In India and Nepal, many Hindus mark\nan infant's transition to solid foods with a ceremony known as Annaprashan, where the baby tastes rice\nfor the first time. in Japan, rice is so central to diets\nthat the word \"gohan\" means both \"cooked rice\" and \"meal.\" The global expansion of rice cultivation\nwas only possible because the plant can grow\nin many climates— from tropical to temperate. As a semi-aquatic plant, rice happily\ngrows in submerged soils. Many other crops can't survive\nin standing water because their root cells rely on air\nwithin soil to access oxygen. But rice plants have air channels\nin their roots that allow oxygen to travel from the leaves and stems\nto the submerged tissues. Traditionally, growers plant\nrice in paddy fields— flat land submerged under as much\nas 10 centimeters of water throughout the growing season. This practice returns high yields\nsince many competing weeds can't hack it in the aquatic environment. But the technique is also water intensive. Rice covers 11% of global cropland, but uses over a third\nof the world's irrigation water. This form of rice production\nalso pumps out a surprising amount\nof greenhouse gas emissions. Flooded fields are the perfect breeding\ngrounds for microorganisms known as methanogens. These microscopic lifeforms thrive\nin environments lacking oxygen, because they evolved when the Earth\ncontained little of this gas. Methanogens are the only organisms\nknown to produce methane— a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent\nthan carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Cows, for example, are infamous\nfor burping out methane due to methanogens in their stomachs. In a flooded paddy field, methanogens set\nto work eating away at organic material in the submerged soil\nand multiplying rapidly, all the while releasing copious amounts\nof methane. The result: rice cultivation\ncontributes around 12% of human-caused methane\nemissions each year. But there's good news. Rice doesn't actually need to grow\nin continuously flooded paddies. Researchers and growers are exploring\nwater management strategies that can cut the methane\nwhile keeping the yield. One promising technique is known\nas alternate wetting and drying. Growers periodically let\nthe water level drop, which keeps methanogen growth in check. Alternate wetting and drying\ncan cut water use by 30% and methane emissions\nby 30 to 70% without impacting yield. Greenhouse gases come from many—\nsometimes unexpected— places. Making rice growing more sustainable\nis just one of the many challenges we'll need to face\nto avoid catastrophic warming. Today, many rice growers still\nflood fields all season long. Changing millennia-old practices\nrequires a major mindset shift. But going against the grain could be\njust what we need to keep our planet healthy\nand our bowls full."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What percentage of calories consumed by humans each year comes from rice?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "40%"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Approximately how long ago was rice first domesticated in Asia?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5,000 years ago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "12,000 years ago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "9,000 years ago"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7,000 years ago"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the percentage of global cropland covered by rice cultivation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "11%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "21%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "14%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "44%"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What fraction of human-caused methane emissions is contributed by rice cultivation each year?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "8%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "12%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "18%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the reduction in water use achieved by the alternate wetting and drying technique in rice cultivation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "40%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "30%"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 117, "lesson": 17, "title": "Are pandas the most misunderstood animal? - Lucy Cooke", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-secret-sex-lives-of-pandas-lucy-cooke", "transcript": {"en": "In the late 1930s, a grand panda drama\nunfolded at the Chicago Zoo. Su-Lin, who had been a media darling\nsince she was a cub, passed away. Zookeepers were already in the process of procuring another female panda\nnamed Mei Mei, and they were determined to find her\na mate before tragedy struck again. So when they acquired a prospective suitor\nnamed Mei Lan, it seemed their troubles were over. Magazines monitored their progress, and the public eagerly awaited\nthe patter of tiny panda paws. But the wait dragged on. At first, headlines declared that Mei Mei\nwas \"getting nowhere\" with her love life. But eventually zookeepers realized\ntheir significant slip-up: both bears were male. This is just one of many mistakes humans\nhave made when it comes to pandas. We've incorrectly classified\nthem as raccoons, misrepresented them as cuddly vegetarians, and— since the doomed union\nof Mei Mei and Mei Lan— declared them as incompetent lovers. Some people have taken this even further, suggesting it's remarkable\nthis sex-shy species has been able to sustain\nthemselves at all. However, this common perception of pandas\nhaving low libidos actually has more to do\nwith human incompetence. When it comes to breeding pandas\nin captivity, zookeepers face multiple challenges. As the Chicago case suggests, it can be\ntricky to figure out a panda's sex. Their external genitals don't appear\nuntil they're a few months old, and once visible, they look very similar. This forces zookeepers to rely\non inconsistent methods, like trying to measure the distance\nbetween the anus and genitals, or simply going by feel. And even when males and females\nare paired up correctly, chemistry isn't guaranteed. In one case at the Moscow Zoo, a female bear that had been isolated\nfrom other animals proved more interested in zookeepers\nthan other pandas. Complicating things further, female pandas can only be impregnated\n1 to 3 days each year due to their incredibly short\novulation window. Zookeepers try to track fertility levels\nby measuring the hormones in their urine, but this data is often cryptic to decipher\nand messy to capture. Females have also evolved the ability\nto reabsorb their own fetuses, meaning that even a successful\nimpregnation can be reversed. The difficulty of breeding pandas\nhas reinforced the idea that they're not naturally\ninclined to procreate. But there's a huge gap between how these\nanimals behave in captivity and the privacy of the wild. Prowling through her home territory, a female panda rubs her anal glands\non tree trunks to attract mates, then waits in the treetops\nbleating as loudly as she can. Soon enough, males crowd around the tree\nand compete for her attention by seeing who can pee the highest. Suitors adopt a variety of poses\nin these competitions, including the \"squat,\" \"legcock,\"\nand \"handstand.\" They're also known to dab urine\nbehind their ears to broadcast their virility\nthrough the breeze. Once a female picks a winner, the mating pair will often have sex\nover 40 times in a single afternoon. At these rates, you might expect\npanda populations to be booming, especially since panda sperm\nis incredibly potent. But females' short ovulation cycles\nand ability to reabsorb fetuses keep the population in check. In the wild, young pandas are usually able\nto witness at least one breeding season before reaching sexual maturity, giving them time to learn\nthe rituals of seduction. But in captivity, pandas are never\nable to learn these customs. And while breeders have tried to kick\nstart young pandas' sexual awakenings by showing them footage of mating elders\nand offering them doses of Viagra, none of these strategies have\nworked consistently. The most reliable approach they've\nfound is artificial insemination, which has dramatically increased\nthe captive population in the past few decades. But if pandas are so much better\nat reproducing in the wild, one has to ask why are conservation\nefforts so focused on breeding them. Maybe our time would be better spent protecting the pandas'\nnatural environments, giving them all the space they need\nto get down to business."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why were Mei Mei and Mei Lan unsuccessful mates at the Chicago Zoo?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mei Mei was not fertile."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mei Mei and Mei Lan did not care for each other."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both Mei Mei and Mei Lan were male."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The zoo environment was not conducive to mating.

Today I’m going to teach you how to read. Which \nis something that you already know how to do,   obviously, but you probably have no \nidea how you’re actually doing it. But first I need to let you in on a secret: There’s a trick being played on \nyou every time you read something. In fact it’s right in front of \nyou right now. Do you see it? Let’s take a closer look at just a couple \nof letters and see if you can see it then.  Here’s just the C and T. These two \nletters are exactly the same weight,   or “size” in this typeface, so you’d \nfigure they’re the exact same height.   But watch what happens when I lay them on top \nof each other. The C is ever-so-slightly taller. It’s true for other letter pairs \ntoo. Like E and S. The S is taller. It’s even true for other typefaces, like this one.  Letters that look the same size \nare actually… not the same size. And this… is on purpose. Because if they actually were the \nsame size, mathematically speaking they wouldn’t look the same size. Letters with rounded tops have to be slightly \ntaller than letters with flat tops in order for   them to appear the same size.\nThis illusion is hiding   in just about everything you’ve ever read.\nYes, it’s even in Comic Sans!  Your letters are lying to \nyou! But if this illusion   wasn’t there, words would look really weird. And that’s because we don’t read with a ruler.   We read with our brain. And \nour brains like to lie to us. The reason all this happens is related to \nanother illusion that maybe you’ve seen before. This line appears longer than this one. But \nin reality the two lines are the same length. This is one of the most famous \nillusions in visual science.   And there’s lots of different versions \nof it. I mean, this is one of the most   powerful illusions I’ve ever seen. Even \nwhen you know the lines are the same length,   it doesn’t change the story your brain tells you.\nIt’s really weird! So what does this have to do with letters? Well, we can explain what’s happening here if we turn the Müller-Lyer illusion on its side: This line, with its ends, \nlooks kinda like the letter O. The other line is more like an I or a T. Our brains decide round letters like O look \nsmaller than more squared off letters nearby,   so we have to make the O bigger \njust to look the same size.  So that’s a really cool \nillusion that fools you probably   hundreds of times a day. And it shows us \nthat there’s a lot more going on with how   we recognize letters and words and turn \nthem into meaning than you might expect. In other words: Reading is really weird. Now, a good reader can recognize \nhundreds of words per minute. And once you learn how to do it, most of us \ndon’t have to actually think about reading. It just happens. But while it feels automatic, there’s \na lot going on under the hood. Or under the skull really. You’re just not consciously aware of any of it. When ya think about it it’s actually \npretty weird that we can read at all. I mean, our brains evolved, pretty much in their \ncurrent form, a hundred thousand years ago or so. But writing is only a few thousand years old.  And standardized movable type, that was only \ninvented like one thousand years ago, in Asia. And then Gutenberg invented \nit again like 600 years ago. I mean think about this: As recently as the 1800s \nmaybe 1 in 8 people actually knew how to read. It’s clearly not something that we evolved \nto do. But we can. So what’s up with that? Luckily I happen to know a language expert, and \nshe just so happens to have her own YouTube show.   So I asked her.\nThanks, Joe! I’m   Dr. Erica Brozovsky, sociolinguist and \ncertified word nerd. On my show Otherwords, we delve into the amazing facets \nof human language,   and the ability to read is \none that almost defies logic. How can a brain that evolved like a hundred \nthousand of years ago be so naturally good   at a skill that we only invented 5,000 years \nago? It’s been called the “paradox of reading” The answer may be that we’ve repurposed \nsome existing brain functions for new uses.   It’s a theory neuroscientist Stanislas \nDehaene called \"neural recycling\" By studying the neural patterns of monkeys, \nscientists have been able to identify how   their brains identify and make sense of the \ncontours and lines that make up visual scenes.   A corner here, an edge there, some intersecting \nedges here. And it seems like there’s a basic   \"alphabet\" of simple shapes that their brains \nuse to decode any number of possible scenes. What’s interesting is these shapes are \nremarkably similar to the strokes that   make up most human writing. Whenever one \nobject is behind another, you get a T   shape. Corners of objects \nmake L's and F's and Y's. And an O can be found in anything from a \ndelicious fruit… to the eye of a predator. What these shapes have in common is that \nthey're \"non-accidental\". If you threw a bunch   of toothpicks on the floor, very rarely would \nthree land with their ends perfectly touching.   So if you see this pattern in real life… \nit's probably worth paying attention to,   and our brains are especially \nadept at spotting it. Each pattern in this “shape \nalphabet” triggers neurons,   and when certain combinations \nof neurons fire together,   they trigger higher order neurons that help \nus eventually decode the meaning of an image. So this combination from our shape \nalphabet triggers the meaning   “cat”. And so does this combination.\nOnly, one is a group of shapes in nature,   and one is just a collection of lines on paper. Early alphabets that used such shapes allowed \nmore people to read, and let them read faster,   eventually replacing cumbersome pictographic \nwriting systems like Egyptian hieroglyphics.   As Dehaene says, \"...our cortex did \nnot specifically evolve for writing…   writing evolved to fit the cortex.\" That… is amazing. So let’s take a closer look at what’s happening   when your brain decodes all these shapes \nand tries to make meaning out of them. How do we read?! One thing that we know about reading   is that your brain isn’t sounding \nout words as you scan the page, like   speaking them in your head. I mean, you might \nbe able to make yourself consciously do that… One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish That’s not how it works. When you read, your brain is directly \nturning those printed symbols into meaning. Now, words are made of letters. And we’ve already seen that we’re really   sensitive to the shapes combinations of \nletters have when they’re put together. So the big question to figure out is: When we \nrecognize a word, do we see a whole word and just   recognize it by its shape?\nOr do we actually read the letters?  You can think of the question this way: When I see \nan elephant, do I see all the individual parts:   it’s big, it’s gray, ears, trunk, \ntusks, and recognize it that way? Or do I just see the whole thing \nand say “that’s an elephant”? To figure that big question \nout, in the 1880s a psychologist   flashed words or letters in front of \npeople for just a few milliseconds. And people more accurately recognized \nthe whole words than letters all alone. And later experiments in the 1960s flashed either \nreal words or nonsense words in front of people   then asked if they recognized \nsome particular letter   And people recognized the right letter \nbetter when it was in a real word. These were a pretty good hint that, to our \nbrains, there’s something special about   whole words over just letters. \nThe “Word Superiority Effect.” And this is kind of strange when you think \nabout how we learn to read. When we’re young   we make words by sounding out the letters or \ncombinations of letters in the order they appear. av-o-cah-do That’s the “phonics” in “hooked on phonics” But the word superiority effect \nsays that once we learn to read,   we don’t actually process words like that. \nWe just… see the word. And we recognize it. Now, at first scientists thought we \nrecognized the literal shape of the word. Like if your brain sees this shape it \nanalyzes that pattern of ascending and   descending characters, and the \nword “shape” must be inside. And this makes sense! We tend to \nread lowercase faster than all caps,   where the letter shapes aren’t as prominent. And (unless you’re super emo) we are terrible \nat reading AlTeRnAtInG upper and lower case. But that word shape explanation turned \nout to be a little too simple. Because   you can’t spell READING… without the eye. Because . . . eye . . . reading . . . never mind. Now, obviously your eyes move when you \nscan a page. But they’re not scanning   smoothly across lines of text. They jump \naround. Sometimes they even jump backwards. These little movements are \ncalled saccades. And they’re   really fast. One jump takes 20 to 35 milliseconds. \nAround 10 times faster than the blink of an eye. You don’t even notice this jumping because \nit happens so fast it doesn’t even have time   to register in your brain. But why can’t we see \nthose jumps? Does anyone know a neuroscientist?! So here’s the crazy thing about saccades: \nYour eyes are jumping around about   three times a second, and in between \nthat they're making these little micro   saccades, they're making little tiny jitters. But you can't see the whole world streaking by.   Why not? Well it's because when your \neyes go on this ballistic jump if we   were actually seeing that it would look like \nthe world is streaking around all the time So we don't experience that. Instead we \njust experience the world out there. Why? It's a very deep reason actually. \nIt's because all you're ever seeing   is your internal model of the outside \nworld. You're not seeing the world as it is. Because it actually takes time for your \neye to move from one place to another.   So what happened to that time? Well it turns out   your brain says okay i'm going to fill \nin the gap with whatever I land on. When your eyes land on the thing \nyou've got this gap in time and so your brain \nessentially  retrospectively fills that in. Thanks David Eagleman! Your eyes stop \non a word for about 200 milliseconds,   then they jump forward 7 to 9 letters.\nBut somehow your eyes never land in between words. And some types of words: like short words \nor connector words like “the” and “and” Your eyes just skip right over them altogether. Now, how much information we gather each time \nour eyes stop is limited by how our eye is built. The fovea is the area in the center of your vision \nwhere the photoreceptors are most densely packed,   and where your vision is the sharpest. It \nsenses an area about the size of your fingertip   at arm’s length. Around that is \nan area called the parafovea.   The photoreceptors are less dense, and it can \nsee some details but things are kinda fuzzy.   And beyond that is basically your peripheral \nvision, where the photoreceptors can basically   just tell that there’s something there, but \nare absolutely terrible at figuring out what. Each time your eyes stop, \nin that split second you’re   gathering information from three different zones. In the center, your fovea clearly \nidentifies 3 to 4 letters around   where your eyes stop. This is usually \nenough to recognize that single word. The second zone is in the \nparafovea. It’s much more blurry,   but can get at least a hint at what the \nfirst few letters of the next word are. And beyond that is an even blurrier zone. No \nletters being identified here, but importantly   you are sensing how long the next word or two is. This gives you enough information to decide \nwhere your eyes will move next. If the next   word is short and can be skipped, or whether it’s \nlong and unfamiliar so you should stop on it. While you are recognizing the word you \nare actually looking at and focusing on,   another part of your eye is already reading \nahead to tell you what’s coming next.  All in all your eyes only stop on \nabout 60% of the words you read. Yet   somehow you still read all of them. AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA YOU’RE DOING THIS. So we seem to recognize words not because of their \nshape, but because of the letters they contain.   Which maybe isn’t that surprising,   except we’re seeing most of those \nletters without actually looking at them. We think the way we recognize \nwords works something like this:   When your eyes land on or near a word, say SOAP,   you see ALL the letters, that is, you process \ntheir shapes - basically simultaneously. You don’t scan the letters \nfrom left to right one by one,   as if your brain is looking \nup a word in a dictionary. You know, the first letter \"s\" the second \nletter \"o\" . . . it doesn’t work that way. Your brain simultaneously compares   each letter position with those in \nall the words you’ve seen before. Think of your mental dictionary as a pool \nfull of words. Every word with one letter   in common gets a little jolt in your brain’s \nneural networks and floats above the rest.  The words with two letters in common get a \nbigger jolt in your brain and rise above those. Then the words with three letters \nin common get an even bigger jolt. Until finally, the strongest signal in the \nneural network of your brain’s dictionary   rises to the top, and that’s the \nwinner: The word you recognize. This happens over and over as your eyes \njump from spot to spot across the page,   taking in different kinds of information from \nvarious parts of your eye, unconsciously reading   ahead in your brain, activating countless neural \nnetworks, all in less than a quarter of a second.   And then you move your eyes, and do it again, \nand again, and again. All thanks to some ancient   evolutionary ability you have to recognize \ncertain shapes, curves, and corners.  And the coolest part of all this is \nthe next time you pick up a book,   you won’t even think about \nany of this. You’ll just   enjoy a good story. As long as the I’s \nand the O’s are the right size at least… Stay curious.

But these weren’t shootouts. They were simply playing cards— for a mountain of chips\nworth their weight in gold. Most men wore loaded pistols\nin case a player was caught cheating. When they prepared to make\ntheir bets, however, these cowboys weren’t focused\non their holsters or their cards, but rather on their opponent’s face. Because not even a bullet could protect\nthem from a well-executed bluff. From its earliest incarnations,\npoker has always been a battle of nerves. The game first emerged around 1800\nin the melting pot of New Orleans. At this time, two games\nruled the card tables: French poque played with a 20-card deck,\nand English Brag which used 52-cards. Both these games saw players being dealt\nfive cards from a four-suit deck, and then trying to make the best hand\npossible according to a simple hierarchy. They would then wager on whether\nor not they had the best hand— either adding more money to the pot or folding and forfeiting\ntheir chance to win it. But since each player's cards were only\nrevealed at the end of the hand, someone with bad cards could always bluff— betting enough to scare\nhis opponents into folding. Both games had slightly different hand\ncombinations, but most importantly, Brag allowed players to discard\nand draw new cards, making better hands more likely and\nallowing for another round of betting. Eventually, the Southerners merged\nthe two games into a new version of poque—\nwhich they pronounced pokuh— that created bigger pots and\nopportunities for more complex bluffing. This winning combination of guile, guts,\nand gambling caught on quickly. But its popularity skyrocketed\nafter the invention of the steamboat, which carried livestock, goods,\nand card games up the Mississippi, Ohio,\nand Missouri rivers. By Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860, Americans in every state and territory\nwere playing the newfangled bluffing game. And while many played\nfor low, friendly stakes, some gamblers put their homes\nand livelihoods on the line. These life-changing bets even found\ntheir way into popular novels like “Gone with the Wind,” where Scarlett O’Hara’s father wins\nan entire plantation in a single hand of poker. But as pots became bigger, \nso did the temptation to cheat. Some players enlisted an accomplice\nto spy on opponents and used props to communicate their hands. Others marked important cards with nicks,\ndents, or invisible ink. But perhaps the most common method was\nsneaking a cold deck into the game. Cold decks were pre-sequenced\nto give victims powerful hands that encouraged them to bet big, while giving the cheater\nan even better one. However, even cheaters had to keep\nup with the game’s constant changes. As poker moved west with the Gold Rush,\nnew variants emerged. Five-card Stud became the game of choice among notorious gunmen like Doc Holliday,\nWyatt Earp, and Wild Bill Hickok. With four rounds of betting, Five-card Stud produced\neven more lucrative pots, encouraging so much cheating that\nCalifornia outlawed the game in 1885. Meanwhile, back in Texas,\nanother variant emerged to solve the common problem of having\ntoo many players and not enough cards. This game, known as Texas Hold'em, became a favorite because its low ratio\nof private, hidden cards to shared, exposed cards allowed for plenty of deductions\nand tactical maneuvering. Even more exciting was no-limit Hold’em,\nwhich allowed players to go all in, betting everything they had\nat any point in the hand. In 1928, Hungarian polymath\nJohn von Neumann sought to explain the nuances of betting\nand bluffing in mathematical terms. His work became the foundation\nfor a whole new branch of mathematics called game theory, which has grown to be vitally important\nnot only in high-stakes poker, but in economics and military strategy. In the late 20th century,\ngame theory became essential for navigating the geopolitical bluffing\ngame of nuclear warfare. Today, America’s card game\nis an international affair, attracting players\nfrom over a hundred countries to the annual World Series of Poker. Fortunes are made and lost every\nday on casino floors, poker websites, and in thousands of live\nand online tournaments. So while a single game's outcome\nwill never be certain, poker is definitely here to stay."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In what part of the world did poker originate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Southern Scotland"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The American South"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Southern California"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Southeastern China"}, {"label": "E", "text": "South America"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What invention helped spread the game of poker from New Orleans to many other cities, states, and territories?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Henry Ford’s automobile"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Robert Fulton’s steamboat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "George Washington Carver’s peanut thresher"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The airplane and the automobile"}, {"label": "E", "text": "The Wright Brothers’ airplane"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What scientist used poker logic to develop the branch of mathematics known as Game Theory?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gladys West"}, {"label": "B", "text": "John von Neumann"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Neil deGrasse Tyson"}, {"label": "D", "text": "George Washington Carver"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Marie Curie"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the most popular poker variant today?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Omaha blackjack"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Obama lowball draw"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Five-card stud"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Seven-card stud"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Texas hold’em"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What state banned stud poker in 1885?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "New Mexico"}, {"label": "B", "text": "California"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Louisiana"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mississippi"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Ohio"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 117, "lesson": 20, "title": "The science of laughter - Sasha Winkler", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-science-of-laughter-sasha-winkler", "transcript": {"en": "Isn’t it odd that, when something’s funny, you might show your teeth,\nchange your breathing, become weak and achy in some places,\nand maybe even cry? In other words, why do we do\nthis bizarre thing that is laughter? When you laugh, your abdominal muscles\ncontract rapidly. This alters your breathing patterns, increasing the pressure in your\nchest cavity, and pushing air out, which might audibly emerge as a snort,\nwheeze, or vocalization. Because you’re exerting your abdominal\nmuscles much more than you usually would while talking, they may start to hurt. Laughter also inhibits your reflexes\nand muscle control, causing sensations like leg weakness. So, where does this funny phenomenon\ncome from? Because there’s no archaeological\nrecord of laughter, it’s impossible to say exactly how and why\nit evolved, but scientists have some theories. Importantly, humans are not\nthe only animals today that do something like laughter. Using ultrasonic recorders, researchers in the late 90s realized\nthat rats were basically giggling while being tickled. Scientists have since compiled evidence\nof at least 65 species— mostly mammals, but also some birds—\nthat vocalize during social play. Some, unsurprisingly,\nare our closest relatives. By recording and analyzing the sounds\nprimates make while playing and being tickled, researchers grew more convinced that\nthe ancient ancestor of all great apes did something like laughter. And, because other apes make laughter-like\nsounds during rough-and-tumble play, they think laughter may have originally\ndeveloped to clearly signal friendly, non-aggressive intent. But of course, humans don’t just laugh\nwhen we’re wrestling, but also when we’re amused,\nand even surprised, confused, or nervous. Some scientists think laughter took\non expanded functions after humans split from other great apes and developed large social groups\nand more complex language abilities. They hypothesize that laughter gradually\nbecame something we could use not just during play but within speech\nto convey subtle meanings and a range of contexts\nto show our emotions. This is thought to be one of the reasons\nthat laughter is contagious: it’s like an invitation to share\nin someone’s emotional state. Just hearing clips of laughter can\nactivate key regions in your brain, triggering you to smile or laugh yourself. And, when participants in one study\nwatched a funny video, they laughed significantly longer\nand more often when another person was present— even though they reported feeling\nthe same level of amusement. Human laughter is also generally louder than the play vocalizations\nof most animals. Some scientists speculate that this\nis because our laughter functions not only as a signal between individuals,\nbut a broadcast to everyone around. Studies found that observers across the\nworld and as young as 5 months old could reliably tell the difference\nbetween close friends and acquaintances just from brief clips of them laughing. Similarly, we can tell whether a laugh\nis real or fake based just on the sound. Fake, or volitional, laughter is produced in entirely different networks\nin the brain, relying on speech-like pathways. Meanwhile, spontaneous laughter arises\nfrom older networks that other animals also use\nfor their vocalizations. And laughter is not just\nsocially important; it’s also thought to be good for us. When we laugh, our brains release\nfeel-good neurotransmitters like endorphins, and decrease levels of stress hormones\nlike cortisol. Some research even suggests that people\nwho laugh more can cope with stress more effectively\nand have better cardiovascular health. Laughter is a universal human behavior. Babies can laugh before they can speak. Whether it's the best medicine\ndepends on your ailment. But as something that makes\nlife more tolerable, strengthens bonds, and potentially\nimproves aspects of your health, you can’t go wrong with a good laugh. Unless you have a broken rib or something.

{"page": 117, "lesson": 21, "title": "Does planting trees actually cool the planet? - Carolyn Beans", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/does-planting-trees-actually-fight-climate-change-carolyn-beans", "transcript": {"en": "In the fight to curb climate change, there are few solutions more discussed\nthan planting lots and lots of trees. It sounds simple enough— trees absorb\nCO2 from the atmosphere to grow, so planting more of them should help\neliminate greenhouse gases. The trouble is, tree planting efforts\ndon't always work as planned. For example, between 1974 and 2012, the Chilean government helped\nfund the planting of over a million hectares of new trees. Yet a recent analysis suggests\nthis multi-million dollar effort resulted in no major carbon storage gains. What went wrong? Chile focused on afforestation: the planting of trees in places long\ndevoid of— or never home to— any forest, as opposed to reforestation, the practice of restoring recently\ndegraded forests. Many governments and international\norganizations champion afforestation in their efforts to meet\nlofty tree planting goals that require massive amounts of land. The Bonn Challenge, launched in 2011\nby the German government and the International Union\nfor Conservation of Nature, aims to restore 350 million hectares\nof degraded land across the globe by 2030, in part through afforestation. Many companies have also seized\non tree planting to offset emissions and, in some cases, negative PR from their\ncontributions to the climate emergency. A 2021 Oxfam analysis found that the area\nneeded to match the tree planting goals set by four of the largest\noil and gas producers would require land twice the size\nof the UK. Here's where things get complicated. In order to be a long-term carbon sink, trees need to grow to maturity\nand stay put. Most of Chile's afforestation funding went\nto the commercial forestry industry, which drastically expanded plantations\nof mostly non-native trees— in some cases even by plowing\ninto native forests. According to one study, on average, natural forests are 40 times better\nat carbon storage than plantations. A mature tree can absorb up to\n22 kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. But plantation trees are harvested. Further, pine and eucalyptus—\ntwo commonly grown plantation trees— are highly flammable, so gains in carbon storage\ncan quickly go up in smoke. And not all land should be forested. In 2019, researchers estimated that,\nof the 100 million hectares of land targeted for a tree planting initiative\nin Africa, most is savanna. Dropping trees into Africa’s savannas\nthreatens wildlife that thrive in sunlight and open spaces. And wildfires,\nnot to mention a passing elephant, can quickly stomp out years\nof tree growth. Meanwhile, a savanna’s natural vegetation\ntucks most of its carbon safely away below ground, where it’s protected\nfrom fire and hungry herbivores. Planting trees can also have\nunintended consequences in places that naturally reflect sunlight like drylands or snowy terrain. Trees in these regions could absorb\nmore of the Sun’s rays, contributing to a warmer planet. It’s not that we shouldn’t\nplant more trees. But for the best chance of success, programs should consider which\nspecies to plant, which lands to forest, and how to protect the land long-term. Today, Chile is prioritizing planting\nnative trees rather than timber plantations. Some researchers argue that a more\nefficient way to re-green the planet is to protect forests\nand let nature do the work. On recently deforested land, seeds wait in soil and new sprouts grow\nfrom old stumps. As time passes, birds and winds\ndeliver seeds from forests nearby. Others support programs that practice\nassisted natural regeneration— helping nature along by removing grasses\nthat compete with saplings, preventing grazing,\nand even planting trees in small patches. So when is it bad to plant trees? When programs put the wrong trees\nin the wrong places.

And while applying a coating of \nsalt is the time-tested method for rendering a frozen highway \ndrivable, that salt has major downsides. It’s toxic for plants, wildlife \nand freshwater ecosystems. It contaminates our drinking \nwater and air quality. It can even damage our cars, which, \nlike, feels a bit counter-productive. So, how do we make winter roads safe \nfor both drivers and the environment? Well, science says we have options. [♪ INTRO] Salting a road is by far the \nmost common de-icing technique. When salt mixes with water, the resulting solution has a lower freezing temperature \nthan water by itself. However, this is true for all kinds \nof solutions, not just salty ones. Thanks to a scientific principle \ncalled freezing point depression, the temperature at which \nplain H2O freezes is always higher than its freezing point when \nsomething is dissolved into it. Essentially, the salt keeps water \nmolecules from forming solid ice crystals because the salt interrupts \nthe watery ice structure. The temperature at which the \nsalty water eventually freezes depends on how salty the solution is. And although salting roads with the \nclassic sodium chloride is effective, it wreaks havoc on plants and wildlife, \ncontributes to poor air, soil and water quality, ruins infrastructure like water \ntreatment plants and bridges, and corrodes our stuff (like the steel in cars). Which is why some places are experimenting with a few solutions to this chilly conundrum. We can start simple: even a different \nkind of salt can make a difference! The sodium chloride you put on your food \nis chemically the same as the rock salt, or halite, that's spread on roads to melt ice. It's cheap, effective, and the infrastructure for delivering it to roads is already in place. The problem is that the \nchlorides in the sodium chloride don't ever break down in the environment. But other salts are better for the environment, if only because less is required \nin solution to achieve the same freezing point depression we get with a \nhigher concentration of sodium chloride. Remember, a salt is just any compound \nthat has positive and negative ions, which together make a neutral charge. There are a lot of options \nfor what salts you can use. For instance, magnesium \nchloride and calcium chloride lower the freezing point more effectively \ndue to some interesting chemistry. When sodium chloride dissolves in water, \nit dissociates into two ions: Na+ and Cl-. Magnesium chloride and calcium \nchloride, on the other hand, dissociate into three ions \neach, since they’re each made of three total atoms instead of the two in NaCl. And because the number of \ndissolved particles in a solution is what determines how low the \nfreezing point of a solution can get, salts like calcium chloride can do \nthe same job as sodium chloride, while using less raw salt to do it. Some states like Connecticut have used \nmagnesium chloride salts for de-icing, citing the lower cost of the solution. However, there is a downside: they’re \nstill somewhat corrosive to cars, making them less than ideal. And these salts are also bad for the \nenvironment when they accumulate; it just doesn't happen as \nfast as with sodium chloride, because less is needed to do the job. Figuring out which ions react with \nwhat can be a major chemistry puzzle.

So, if your ears perked up at the \nmere mention of the environment, just wait until you hear about \nthis next de-icing alternative. Of course, there are other options \nbeyond salts for de-icing roads. Some state road agencies have \ntested all kinds of weird stuff: cheese brine, pickle juice, beet \njuice and pig pee, to name a few. Welcome to the wild world of potentially \neco-friendly methods for melting road ice! Byproducts from vodka distilleries or \nsugar beet processing facilities contain a lot of sugars, which, when added to \nroad salts, helps lower the melting point of the ice, meaning the salt will work \nbetter at even lower temperatures. But not all eco-options are created equal. For instance, some communities have \ncomplained about the smell from that beet wastewater, and some research \nshows that distillery byproducts can also cause some of those ecosystem \nproblems that we’re trying to avoid. Urea is also marketed as an eco-friendly \nsolution to road salt, since it’s also water-soluble and makes a solution with \na lower freezing point than pure water. And while urea is great at \nde-icing and is generally safe for pets and children to be around, \nthere are some downsides. It doesn't perform well below - 4 degrees \ncelsius and once it gets into a waterway, it decreases dissolved oxygen \nand causes algal blooms. ~ Plus, urea is actually somewhat expensive, at least compared to the other options out there. Still, there’s definitely a market for more \nof these less harmful options for de-icing. The other way to help de-ice our roads \nis also the way to make pickles - brine. But I’m not talking about \nyour leftover pickle juice! Brine is just water that’s got a lot of \nsalts dissolved in it, and using brine on the roads is a pretty neat way to prevent \nthe ice from forming in the first place. When you de-ice a road that's already \nbeen snowed upon, transportation agencies use wet rock salt to break the bond between the ice and the road, making it safer to drive. But the idea behind the brine is to apply \nliquid salt to the road ahead of time. Some places have started brining the roads with liquid salt solution before \nthe snow or ice shows up. This limits the amount of ice that \ncan form on the road to begin with, and uses about a quarter of the salt of de-icing. Brining requires a lot of infrastructure \nand planning; a community needs trucks with big tanks and pumps to spray \nthe brine onto the pavement surface. This stuff can be expensive. However, communities that have \ninvested in brining roads have reported reducing the overall cost of maintaining \nwinter roads, even after accounting for the extra equipment and staffing. And the reason for the savings is simple: \nthey're just not buying as much salt! So, while nothing is perfect, there are \nabsolutely some ways we can move ahead on making our roads safer and more eco-friendly. Let’s just hope they don’t all smell like pig pee.

Whalers saw a 58% drop in their successful\nstrikes within just a few years. Sperm whales in the region had\nsuddenly become much harder to kill. Generally, when predators\nlike orcas are nearby, sperm whales protect their most vulnerable by forming defensive circles\nat the surface. But this behavior made them\nsusceptible to whaling ships. It seems that sperm whales\nin the North Pacific were somehow able to quickly\nadapt to this reality. Groups that likely hadn’t yet experienced\nhuman attacks began escaping whaling boats\non fast currents instead of forming defensive circles. And, based on what we’re starting\nto understand about sperm whales, it seems possible they were actually\nbroadcasting survival strategies to one another. Indeed, unbeknownst to whalers, spermaceti, the material they killed for, is an essential part of the sperm whale’s\nsophisticated communication and echolocation system. This waxy substance fills a cavity\nin the sperm whale’s head. And their head is mostly comprised\nof an expanded nose that serves as a highly calibrated\nsonar system. Sperm whales generate some of the loudest\nbiological noises on record, communicate copiously using\nan array of complex vocalization styles, and have the largest brains on Earth. They spend most of their time searching\nthe ocean's depths for prey. They can stay submerged for over an hour,\nand dive deeper than 1,200 meters, far beyond sunlight’s reach,\nwhere they’re guided by sound. The loudest noise recorded underwater\nis around 270 decibels. Sperm whale-generated sounds\ncan reach 230. And they frequently fix\ntheir high-intensity echolocation clicks on squid. Some of the air they inhale through their\nblowhole is routed into their lungs, while the rest enters a complex,\nsound-producing system. There, air is funneled through lip-like\nappendages at the front of their heads. This generates a sound that travels\nbackwards through their spermaceti organ, bounces off an air sac,\nthen traverses another waxy organ, which amplifies and directs the sound. The click exits the sperm whale’s head\na powerful, focused beam. It’s suspected that\nthe returning vibrations are received by the whale’s lower jaw\nand directed into the ears. Then, their brain’s expanded\nauditory processing region analyzes the quality of the echoes\nto map their surroundings in the darkness. With this mechanism, sperm whales\ncan locate squid 300 meters away. Scientists think squid don’t hear\nthese high-frequency clicks— even as they turn into rapid buzzes\nand creaks as the whale closes in. Sperm whales can eat more than a ton\nof squid every day. Their stomachs and feces are usually\nfull of indigestible squid beaks, and their skin often scarred\nby squid tentacles. When they're not hunting, however, sperm whales use an entirely\ndifferent vocal repertoire. Mature males make clang noises, which scientists suspect play a role\nin mating. And most other sperm whales live\nin social family groups. Though their communication might get\ninterrupted when predators are near or human-generated noises dominate, they generally chatter at length\nat the water’s surface. Sperm whales do this using patterned click\nsequences akin to Morse code, called codas, which are thought to function\nas social identity markers. Researchers have identified dozens\nof distinct types of codas, according to patterns in the numbers\nof clicks used and their rhythm and tempo. Some codas are more ubiquitous, while others vary greatly according\nto family groups and individuals. All families in a given region that consistently use some of the same\ncharacteristic coda patterns share a dialect\nand belong to the same vocal clan. Each sperm whale calf goes\nthrough a multi-year period of babbling, where they experiment\nwith different sounds before becoming fluent\nin their clan’s coda dialect. How and what exactly sperm whales\ncommunicate to each other is currently unknown, but there are indications that the\ninformation can be sophisticated. Biologists, roboticists, linguists,\ncryptographers, and artificial intelligence experts are collaborating to monitor and analyze\nsperm whale vocalizations. The aim is to finally decipher\nwhat they're saying."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Sperm whales can generate sounds that can reach up to ____ decibels as measured underwater.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "180"}, {"label": "B", "text": "200 "}, {"label": "C", "text": "230 "}, {"label": "D", "text": "270"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Sperm whale communication is based on exchanging patterns of clicks with distinct rhythm and tempo called ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Codes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Codas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Morse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Echolocation"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The sperm whale gets its name from this waxy substance for which the whalers killed them.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spermaceti"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cachalot"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spermatozoa"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Spermacite"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Sperm whales are ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The loudest animal on the planet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The largest predator in the oceans"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The largest-brained animal to ever live"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The deepest divers of all whales"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Sperm whale families which share the same vocal dialect are called a ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tribe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Team"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Community"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Clan"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
