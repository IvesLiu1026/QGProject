However, he wasn’t the first person\nto hunt that specific bird. Upon recovering the stork, von Bothmer found it impaled \nby a yard long wooden spear. A local professor determined \nthe weapon was African in origin, suggesting that somehow, \nthis stork was speared in Africa and then flew over 2,500 kilometers \nto the count’s castle. This astonishing flight wasn’t just\nevidence of the stork’s resilience. It was an essential clue in a mystery\nthat plagued scientists for centuries: the seasonal disappearance of birds. Ancient naturalists had various theories\nto explain the annual vanishing act we now know as migration. Aristotle himself proposed \nthree particularly popular ideas. One theory was that birds transformed into\ndifferent bodies that suited the season. For example, summer time garden warblers were believed to transform \ninto black caps every winter. In reality these are two distinct species—\nsimilar in shape and size, but never appearing at the same time. Over the following centuries, birds \nwere said to morph into humans, plants, and even the timbers of ships. This last transmutation was especially\npopular with many Christian clergy. If barnacle geese were truly made of wood, they could be deemed vegetarian \nand enjoyed during meatless fasts. Aristotle’s second and even more enduring\nhypothesis was that birds hibernate. This isn’t so far-fetched. Some species do enter short, deep sleeps which lower their heart rates\nand metabolisms. And there’s at least one truly \nhibernating bird: the common poorwill sleeps out winters\nin the deserts of North America. But researchers were proposing much more\noutlandish forms of hibernation well into the 19th century. Barn swallows were said to remove \ntheir feathers and hibernate in holes, or sleep through the winter at the bottom\nof lakes and rivers. Aristotle’s final theory \nwas much more reasonable, and resembled something\nlike realistic migration. However, this idea was also taken \nto extremes. In 1666, the leading migration advocate\nwas convinced that each winter, birds flew to the moon. It might seem strange that prominent \nresearchers considered such bizarre ideas. But to be fair, the true story \nof migration may be even harder\nto believe than their wildest theories. Roughly 20% of all bird species \nmigrate each year, following warm weather and fresh food\naround the planet. For birds who spend their summers\nin the northern hemisphere, this journey can span \nfrom 700 to over 17,000 kilometers, with some flights lasting as long\nas four months. Birds who migrate across oceans may soar\nwithout stopping for over 100 hours. Sleeping and eating on the fly, \nthey navigate the endless ocean by the stars, wind currents, \nand Earth’s magnetic field. Tracking the specifics of these epic\nexpeditions is notoriously difficult. And while birds often take \nthe most direct route possible, storms and human development\ncan alter their paths, further complicating our attempts\nto chart migration. Fortunately, Count von Bothmer’s stork\noffered physical proof not only that European storks were\nmigrating south for the winter, but also where they were migrating to. Ornithologists across the continent were eager to map the trajectory\nof this flight, including Johannes Thienemann. Owner of the world’s first permanent\nbird observatory, Thienemann was a major public advocate\nfor the study of birds. And to solve the field’s biggest mystery, he wrangled an army of volunteers\nfrom across Germany. His team used aluminum rings to tag\nthe legs of two thousand storks with unique numbers and the address\nof his offices. Then he advertised the initiative \nas widely as possible. His hope was that word of the experiment\nwould find its way to Africa, so people finding the tags would know\nto mail them back with more information. Sure enough, from 1908 to 1913, Thienemann received 178 rings, \n48 of which had been found in Africa. Using this data, he plotted the first\nmigration route ever discovered, and definitively established that storks\nwere not, in fact, flying to the moon."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following events contributed to Count von Bothmer’s discovery?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Count von Bothmer shot down a stork while hunting."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The unlucky stork had also been impaled by a 3 feet wooden spear"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The spear was African in origin, some nearly 2500 kms (1500 miles) away"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following cannot be one of Aristotle’s 3 theories relating to migration?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Birds transformed into different bodies that suited the season"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Birds hibernated."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Birds were gathered up by a secret society of ornithologists"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Birds went somewhere else"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "True or False: The theory of transmutation as it relates to bird migration believed that birds could morph into humans.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "True or False: The theory of transmutation has been scientifically proven.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following was not an outlandish scientific theory associated with the migration of birds?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Birds flew to the moon each winter"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Birds changed into a different species of birds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Birds removed their feathers and hid in holes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Birds slept through the winter at the bottom of lakes and rivers"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None of the above."}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Birds that migrate across oceans…", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "may soar without stopping for 100 hours"}, {"label": "B", "text": "sleep and eat while flying"}, {"label": "C", "text": "navigate by the stars, wind, and earth’s magnetic field"}, {"label": "D", "text": "take flights that might last up to 4 months"}, {"label": "E", "text": "cover distances between 700 to 17000 kms (approx. 450 to 11000 miles)"}, {"label": "F", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "F"}, {"question": "What was the one thing von Bothmer didn’t do once he found proof that birds were migrating instead of mysteriously vanishing every winter?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Kept it quiet by not telling anyone about his work."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Collaborate with other ornithologists and volunteers to map bird flight trajectories"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Place aluminum individually numbered ring tags on the legs of 2000 storks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Use the data collected to plot the first migration route ever discovered and documented"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
