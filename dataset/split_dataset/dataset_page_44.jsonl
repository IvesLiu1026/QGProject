{"page": 44, "lesson": 4, "title": "What are trees made of?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/tt8nl9uK", "transcript": {"en": "Trees are some of the \nbiggest organisms on the planet, but where do they get that matter to grow? Man: Rich nutrients out the ground. Man: Start with soil or in the air. Man: Goodness out of the soil, I suppose. Derek Muller: Comes out of the soil? Man: Yeah... Derek Muller: Yeah... Derek Muller: Goodness. Man: Goodness. Derek Muller: Why isn't there a big hole \naround the tree where it's taking out all the soil? Man (right): 'Cause it does it so \ngradually that the soil is time to recover. Derek Muller: Now, I think it's intuitive to believe that the tree gets most of its mass from the soil because you can see those roots\ndigging into the soil and they must be taking something out of there and I mean\na tree looks like dirt and it feels solid like dirt but it's not. In the early 1600 a scientist \nnamed Johann Baptist Van Helmholt tried to figure out where the mass\nof a tree was coming from so he got a pot of soil and very carefully \nmeasured the amount of soil in there. Then he planted the tree and  \ntook care of it for five years making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot . At the end of this experiment he was weighted the tree \nto find that it was 72 kilograms but the massive soil had\nonly decreased by about 60 grams. This was pretty strong evidence that the\nmass of the tree does not come from the soil. I've never thought about that actually\nbecause they don't really eat anything, trees. They don't eat anything?\n--No. They don't eat anything? Water, it's all basically absorbed.\n--That's all they eat? Yeah.\n--They don't eat anything else? No.\n--That's all they eat. Well presumably from the water \nand the nutrients from the soil. Is there anything else that you need \nbesides the soil and the water? I suppose that's all you need, isn't it? To make--\n--Other than the original seed for that particular tree, I suppose. The seed, the soil, and the water and\nthat makes this big tree. Derek Muller: Of course Johann Baptist Van Helmholt\ndid conclude that the tree was made entirely of water. Now while that's not correct \nat least he was on the right track realizing that the matter of a tree \ndoesn't  come out of the soil. The sun energy, yeah. The sun energy?\n--Yeah. Are they converting energy into mass or--? Do you know what I mean?\n--Yeah. Like that there wasn't stuff and then  there was. Where did that stuff come from? Magic. [laughing]\nI have no idea. My question is where do they \nget that mass to grow big? Sun. Get it from the rain and the sun presuably. Light.\n--Sunlight. The sunshine.\nThe sunshine? Does the sunshine add mass to the tree? It would need sunshine to grow. Yes, they wouldn't grow without it.\nI don't know whether it adds mass, but they wouldn't go without it. Of course the sun's energy is needed for\nthe tree to build the matter into its branches and leaves but the Sun itself\nthe energy is not matter. Well I suppose you've got to put air into this as well. There's got to be something, you know. What is it about the air?\n--A gas in the air that it needs as well. Oxygen.\nThe trees need the oxygen? And I guess oxygen. The oxygen, of course. The oxygen? Are there any ingredients that we're missing? Carbon dioxide. Would it surprise you to find out that 95% \nof a tree is actually from carbon dioxide. Trees are largely made up of air. Yeah.\n--Surprising. I need this reaction like, \"Oh holy sh-- [laughing] So as it turns out trees are mostly made out of air, out of the carbon dioxide that they take in. What's interesting is that we breathe\nout carbon dioxide and water that's how we lose mass but it's the exact same substances\n that trees breathe in to gain mass. So if you can imagine a closed system \nwhere it's just you and a tree. You would breathe out that carbon\ndioxide and water the tree would take it in. So you would get smaller \nwhile the tree is getting bigger and in a sense you're becoming the tree."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "3. 95% of a tree's mass is from", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "oxygen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "dirt"}, {"label": "D", "text": "carbon dioxide"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "4.

They can all shred, but how exactly do the iconic \ncontraptions in their hands produce notes, rhythm, melody and music. When you pluck a guitar string, you create\na vibration called a standing wave. Some points on the string, called nodes,\ndon't move at all, while other points, anti-nodes, \noscillate back and forth. The vibration translates through the neck\nand bridge to the guitar's body, where the thin and flexible wood vibrates, jostling the surrounding air molecules\ntogether and apart. These sequential compressions\ncreate sound waves, and the ones inside the guitar\nmostly escape through the hole. They eventually propagate to your ear, which translates them into\nelectrical impulses that your brain interprets as sound. The pitch of that sound depends on\nthe frequency of the compressions. A quickly vibrating string will cause\na lot of compressions close together, making a high-pitched sound, and a slow vibration \nproduces a low-pitched sound. Four things affect the frequency\nof a vibrating string: the length, the tension,\nthe density and the thickness. Typical guitar strings \nare all the same length, and have similar tension,\nbut vary in thickness and density. Thicker strings vibrate more slowly,\nproducing lower notes. Each time you pluck a string, you actually create \nseveral standing waves. There's the first fundamental wave,\nwhich determines the pitch of the note, but there are also waves\ncalled overtones, whose frequencies \nare multiples of the first one. All these standing waves combine\nto form a complex wave with a rich sound. Changing the way you pluck the string\naffects which overtones you get. If you pluck it near the middle, you get mainly the fundamental\nand the odd multiple overtones, which have anti-nodes\nin the middle of the string. If you pluck it near the bridge,\nyou get mainly even multiple overtones and a twangier sound. The familiar Western scale is based on\nthe overtone series of a vibrating string. When we hear one note played with another\nthat has exactly twice its frequency, its first overtone, they sound so harmonious\nthat we assign them the same letter, and define the difference between them\nas an octave. The rest of the scale \nis squeezed into that octave divided into twelve half steps whose frequency is each 2^(1/12)\nhigher than the one before. That factor determines the fret spacing. Each fret divides the string's\nremaining length by 2^(1/12), making the frequencies \nincrease by half steps. Fretless instruments, like violins, make it easier to produce the infinite\nfrequencies between each note, but add to the challenge \nof playing intune. The number of strings and their tuning are custom tailored \nto the chords we like to play and the physiology of our hands. Guitar shapes and materials can also vary, and both change the nature \nand sound of the vibrations. Playing two or more \nstrings at the same time allows you to create new wave patterns\nlike chords and other sound effects. For example, when you play two notes\nwhose frequencies are close together, they add together to create a sound wave\nwhose amplitude rises and falls, producing a throbbing effect,\nwhich guitarists call the beats. And electric guitars give you \neven more to play with. The vibrations still start in the strings, but then they're translated \ninto electrical signals by pickups and transmitted to speakers \nthat create the sound waves. Between the pickups and speakers, it's possible to process \nthe wave in various ways, to create effects like distortion,\noverdrive, wah-wah, delay and flanger. And lest you think that the physics \nof music is only useful for entertainment, consider this. Some physicists think that everything\nin the universe is created by the harmonic series\nof very tiny, very tense strings. So might our entire reality be the extended solo \nof some cosmic Jimi Hendrix? Clearly, there's a lot more to strings\nthan meets the ear."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Many factors affect the frequency of a vibrating string.

If you're cooking just for yourself and your\nspouse, it's easy: you make something you both like. But if you've got guests, things\nget harder. If you need to accommodate a vegetarian, and someone who is gluten free, and someone\nwith a soy allergy, your options get really limited. And that's the problem with Europe's\nidea of having a whole bunch of countries all use the same currency. So Greece's economy\nis in a disaster. A quarter of the population is unemployed, and it has this very high debt\nburden. Normally, if you've got really high unemployment, what happens is that a country\nmakes its currency cheaper by printing extra money. That makes its products cheaper on\nworld markets, it makes it a more attractive tourist destination, and it means that foreign\ninvestors can get great bargains. But if unemployment is really low, a country likes to have an\nexpensive currency. That increases people's purchasing power and it keeps prices down.\nAnd in Europe, you have a bunch of economies that are really different. A price of Euros\nthat's appropriate for Greece, where they have a 25% unemployment rate is way too low\nfor Germany, where the unemployment rate is below 5%. And Greece's problem is that it's\nsmall, poor, and geographically isolated from the rest of the Eurozone. It's like the only\nvegetarian at a barbeque, except when it comes to currencies, there's no side dishes. And\nso there's plenty of specific decisions we can second-guess, plenty of things Greece\ndid and various banks did that we can question, but fundamentally having all these countries\ncome to a dinner party with only one dish on the menu was a mistake. The euro was a\nproject that Europe set about on for really political reasons. It was a symbol of their\ndetermination to have peace on the continent, but they didn't really take the economics\nof it seriously. So Greece joins the euro in 2001 and initially, it works out great\nfor Greece because all of a sudden everyone was like 'yeah, sure, let's lend them money.'\nSo they borrowed lots and lots and lots of euros, except that didn't change the fact\nthat their economy is a lot weaker than some of the other European countries. So to really\nwork, you would need a much, much, much closer union, where you had big financial transfers\ncoming from the richer places to the poorer places all the time. In the United States,\nthe poor states like Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, they're constantly getting money\nfrom the richer states like Massachusetts, California, New York, through the welfare\nsystem, through Social Security, through Medicare, through Medicaid. And you know, people may\ncomplain about this or that program, but we don't dispute the idea that it's all one country\nso money is going to circulate around. Europeans, you know, they just don't feel that way. Germans\nare willing to support poor German people, but they don't want to support Greek people\nwith their tax dollars.

A philosophical inquiry - Amy Adkins", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/who-am-i-a-philosophical-inquiry-amy-adkins", "transcript": {"en": "Throughout the history of mankind, three little words have sent poets\nto the blank page, philosophers to the Agora, and seekers to the oracles: \"Who am I?\" From the ancient Greek aphorism\ninscribed on the Temple of Apollo, \"Know thyself,\" to The Who's rock anthem, \"Who Are You?\" philosophers, psychologists, academics, scientists, artists,\ntheologians and politicians have all tackled the subject of identity. Their hypotheses are widely varied\nand lack significant consensus. These are smart, creative people, so what's so hard about coming up\nwith the right answer? One challenge certainly lies with the complex concept \nof the persistence of identity. Which you is who? The person you are today? Five years ago? Who you'll be in 50 years? And when is \"am\"? This week? Today? This hour? This second? And which aspect of you is \"I\"? Are you your physical body? Your thoughts and feelings? Your actions? These murky waters of abstract logic\nare tricky to navigate, and so it's probably fitting\nthat to demonstrate the complexity, the Greek historian Plutarch\nused the story of a ship. How are you \"I\"? As the tale goes, Theseus, the mythical\nfounder King of Athens, single-handedly slayed \nthe evil Minotaur at Crete, then returned home on a ship. To honor this heroic feat, for 1000 years Athenians painstakingly\nmaintained his ship in the harbor, and annually reenacted his voyage. Whenever a part of the ship\nwas worn or damaged, it was replaced with an identical piece\nof the same material until, at some point, \nno original parts remained. Plutarch noted the Ship of Theseus was an example \nof the philosophical paradox revolving around \nthe persistence of identity. How can every single part \nof something be replaced, yet it still remains the same thing? Let's imagine there are two ships: the ship that Theseus \ndocked in Athens, Ship A, and the ship sailed by the Athenians\n1000 years later, Ship B. Very simply, our question is this:\ndoes A equal B? Some would say that for 1000 years\nthere has been only one Ship of Theseus, and because the changes made to it\nhappened gradually, it never at any point in time\nstopped being the legendary ship. Though they have absolutely \nno parts in common, the two ships are numerically identical,\nmeaning one and the same, so A equals B. However, others could argue\nthat Theseus never set foot on Ship B, and his presence on the ship\nis an essential qualitative property of the Ship of Theseus. It cannot survive without him. So, though the two ships \nare numerically identical, they are not qualitatively identical. Thus, A does not equal B. But what happens \nwhen we consider this twist? What if, as each piece \nof the original ship was cast off, somebody collected them all,\nand rebuilt the entire original ship? When it was finished, undeniably\ntwo physical ships would exist: the one that's docked in Athens, and the one in some guy's backyard. Each could lay claim to the title,\n\"The Ship of Theseus,\" but only would could actually\nbe the real thing. So which one is it, and more importantly, \nwhat does this have to do with you? Like the Ship of Theseus, you are a collection of constantly\nchanging parts: your physical body, mind, emotions,\ncircumstances, and even your quirks, always changing, but still in an amazing\nand sometimes illogical way, you stay the same, too. This is one of the reasons that \nthe question, \"Who am I?\" is so complex. And in order to answer it, like so many great minds before you, you must be willing to dive into the\nbottomless ocean of philosophical paradox. Or maybe you could just answer, \"I am a legendary hero sailing \na powerful ship on an epic journey.\" That could work, too."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who was Theseus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Minotaur"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The mythical founder king of Athens"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A famous Greek historian"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A ship salesman"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What did Theseus do in Crete before sailing home to Athens?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Picked up his dry cleaning"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Competed in the ancient Olympics"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Killed the Minotaur"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Built a ship"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How long did the Athenians maintain the ship of Theseus in the harbor?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1,000 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10,000 years"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "To maintain the ship of Theseus, how often did Athenians replace the parts on it?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Once a year"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Whenever necessary"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Once every thousand years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They never replaced any parts of the ship"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When two things are numerically identical, it means:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are one and the same thing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are two different things in the same place at the same time"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are each half of a whole single thing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Actually, it is impossible for two things to be numerically identical"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

When the tingling sets in, you realize you've been stung \nby a jellyfish. How do these beautiful, gelatinous\ncreatures pack such a painful punch? Jellyfish are soft \nbecause they are 95% water and are mostly made of a translucent \ngel-like substance called mesoglea. With such delicate bodies, they rely on thousands of venom-containing\nstinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture. Even baby jellyfish, \nthe size of a pencil eraser, have the ability to sting. Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like\ntiny flowers pulsating in the sea. As they grow, they become umbrella-shaped\nwith a bell at the top and descending tentacles \naround the margin. The largest species of jellyfish,\nthe lion's mane, has tentacles that can extend \nmore than 100 feet, longer than a blue whale. These tentacles contain \nmost of the stinging cells, although some species have them\non their bells, too. Venom is ejected via a nematocyst, a whip-like hollow tubule, which lies coiled under \nhigh osmotic pressure. When mechanical or chemical stimuli\nactivate an external trigger, the lid of the cell pops open\nand sea water rushes in. This forces a microscopic barbed\nharpoon to shoot out, penetrate and inject \nvenom into its victim. Nematocyst discharge can occur\nin less than a millionth of a second, making it one of nature's fastest\nbiomechanical processes. Nematocysts can continue\nto fire even after a jellyfish has died, so it's important to remove\nlingering tentacles stuck to the skin. Rinsing with vinegar will usually render\nundischarged nematocysts inactive. Seawater can also help \nremove residual nematocysts. But don't use fresh water\nbecause any change in salt balance alters the osmotic pressure \noutside of the cnidocyte and will trigger the nematocyst to fire. That's why urinating on the affected area,\na common folk remedy, may do more harm that good,\ndepending on the composition of the urine. Most jellyfish stings \nare a painful nuisance, but some can be deadly. An Indo-Pacific box jelly,\nalso called a sea wasp, releases venom which can cause\ncontraction of the heart muscles and rapid death in large doses. There's an anti-venom,\nbut the venom is fast-acting, so you'd need immediate \nmedical intervention. Despite the impressive power\nin their tentacles, jellies aren't invincible. Their stinging cells are no match\nfor the armor of thick-skin predators, like the leatherback turtle\nand ocean sunfish. These predators both have adaptations\nthat prevents slippery jellyfish from escaping after they are engulfed: backwards pointing spines \nin the turtle's mouth and esophagus and recurved teeth \nbehind the sunfish's cheeks. Even tiny lobster slipper larvae\ncan cling to the bell of a jellyfish and hitch a ride, snacking on the jelly while they preserve\ntheir own energy for growth. Small agile fish use the jellies\nas moving reefs for protection, darting between tentacles\nwithout ever touching them. Nudibranchs, which are sea slugs\ncovered in protective slime, can actually steal the jelly's defenses\nby eating the cnidocytes and transferring them \nto specialized sacks for later use, as weapons against their own predators. Even humans might benefit\nfrom the sting of a jellyfish one day. Scientists are working on manipulating\ncnidocytes to deliver medicine, with nematocysts rarely 3% of the size\nof a typical syringe needle. So, the next time you're out \nin the ocean, be careful. But also, take a second \nto marvel at its wonders."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the jellyfish's stinging cell called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cnideria"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cnidocyte"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nudibranch"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cnidocil"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The maximum length of a lion's mane jellyfish's tentacles is as long as a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Leatherback turtle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Human"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Blue whale"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lion"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Jellyfish are mostly made of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gelatin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Slime"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Muscle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mesoglea"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The nematocyst can eject in less than a _____ of a second:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Millionth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hundredth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thousandth"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tenth"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Jellyfish are eaten by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Leatherback turtles"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ocean sunfish"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nudibranchs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

{"page": 44, "lesson": 11, "title": "The benefits of good posture - Murat Dalkilinç", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-benefits-of-good-posture-murat-dalkinic", "transcript": {"en": "Has anyone ever told you,\n\"Stand up straight!\" or scolded you for slouching\nat a family dinner? Comments like that might be annoying,\nbut they're not wrong. Your posture, the way you hold your body\nwhen you're sitting or standing, is the foundation for every movement\nyour body makes, and can determine how well your body\nadapts to the stresses on it. These stresses can be things \nlike carrying weight, or sitting in an awkward position. And the big one we all experience \nall day every day: gravity. If your posture isn't optimal, your muscles have to work harder\nto keep you upright and balanced. Some muscles will become tight\nand inflexbile. Others will be inhibited. Over time, these dysfunctional adaptations impair your body's ability \nto deal with the forces on it. Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear\non your joints and ligaments, increases the likelihood of accidents, and makes some organs, \nlike your lungs, less efficient. Researchers have linked \npoor posture to scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain, though it isn't the exclusive \ncause of any of them. Posture can even influence \nyour emotional state and your sensitivity to pain. So there are a lot of reasons\nto aim for good posture. But it's getting harder these days. Sitting in an awkward position \nfor a long time can promote poor posture, and so can using computers \nor mobile devices, which encourage you to look downward. Many studies suggest that, on average,\nposture is getting worse. So what does good posture look like? When you look at the spine \nfrom the front or the back, all 33 vertebrae should appear stacked\nin a straight line. From the side, the spine\nshould have three curves: one at your neck, one at your shoulders,\nand one at the small of your back. You aren't born with this s-shaped spine. Babies' spines just have one curve like a \"c.\" The other curves usually develop\nby 12-18 months as the muscles strengthen. These curves help us stay upright\nand absorb some of the stress from activities like walking and jumping. If they are aligned properly, when you're standing up, you should be able to draw a straight line from a point just in front \nof your shoulders, to behind your hip, to the front of your knee, to a few inches in front of your ankle. This keeps your center of gravity\ndirectly over your base of support, which allows you to move efficiently with the least amount of fatigue\nand muscle strain. If you're sitting, \nyour neck should be vertical, not tilted forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed\nwith your arms close to your trunk. Your knees should be at a right angle\nwith your feet flat on the floor. But what if your posture isn't that great? Try redesigning your environment. Adjust your screen so it's at\nor slightly below eyelevel. Make sure all parts of your body, like your elbows and wrists, \nare supported, using ergonomic aids if you need to. Try sleeping on your side\nwith your neck supported and with a pillow between your legs. Wear shoes with low heels\nand good arch support, and use a headset for phone calls. It's also not enough \nto just have good posture. Keeping your muscles and joints moving\nis extremely important. In fact, being stationary for long periods\nwith good posture can be worse than regular movement\nwith bad posture. When you do move, move smartly. Keep anything you're carrying\nclose to your body. Backpacks should be in contact \nwith your back carried symetrically. If you sit a lot, get up and move around\non occassion, and be sure to exercise. Using your muscles will keep them\nstrong enough to support you effectively, on top of all the other benefits \nto your joints, bones, brain and heart. And if you're really worried,\ncheck with a physical therapist, because yes, \nyou really should stand up straight."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which force on our bodies do we have to deal with all the time?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Compression"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gravity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Traction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pressure"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Sheer"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is the besto ption for musculoskeletal health?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ideal posture"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bad posture along with regular movement/exercise"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bad posture along with less movement/exercise"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ideal posture along with regular movement/exercise"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "which of the following professions may help you if you have bad posture?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Athletic trainer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Physical therapist"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Surgeon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Yoga instructor"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which accessories are available to help people work comfortably in an office?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Office chair"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Wrist support"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Headset"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Foot rest"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

What is that spark? What about lightning, the Northern Lights, or the tail of a comet? All of those things, and many others, in fact 99.9% of the universe,\nare made of plasma. Plasma is a state of matter drastically different \nfrom the more familiar forms. Take ice, for example. Ice, a solid, \nmelts to become water, a liquid, which, when heated, \nvaporizes into steam, a gas. Continued heating of the steam\nat a high enough temperature causes the water molecules \nin it to separate into freely roaming hydrogen \nand oxygen atoms. With a little more heat,\nthe ionization process occurs and the negatively charged electrons\nescape the atoms, leaving behind positively charged ions. This mixture of freely roaming negative\nand positive charges is plasma, and at a high enough temperature,\nany gas can be made into one. These freely moving charged particles\nbehave very differently from the particles \nin other types of matter. When a doorknob, a solid,\nhas static electricity on it, it doesn't look or behave any differently. And with the exception of a compass\nor other magnetic object, we rarely see matter \nrespond to a magnetic field. But put a plasma in an electric field\nor magnetic field, and you'll get a very different reaction. Because plasmas are charged, electric fields accelerate them, and magnetic fields steer them\nin circular orbits. And when the particles \nwithin plasma collide, or accelerated \nby electricity or magnetism, light is generated, which is what we see \nwhen we look at plasmas like the Aurora Borealis. Plasmas aren't just beautiful,\ncelestial phenomena, though. Imagine a tiny cube made of normal gas\nwith a very high voltage across it. The resulting electric field pushes some of the electrons off the atoms\nand accelerates them to high speeds causing the ionization of other atoms. Imbedded impurities \nin the tiny cube of gas cause it to gain and release \na precise amount of energy in the form of ultraviolet radiation. Attached to each tiny cube, a fluorescent material glows\nwith a specific color when ultraviolet light \nat just the right intensity reaches it. Now, make a rectangle \nout of a million of these tiny cubes, each separately controlled\nby sophisticated electronics. You may be looking at one now. This is called a plasma TV. Plasmas also have implications\nfor health care. Plasma chemists create \nhighly specific plasmas that can destroy \nor alter targeted chemicals, thereby killing pathogenic organisms\non food or hospital surfaces. Plasmas are all around us, in forms that are both spectacular\nand practical. And in the future, plasma could be used to permanently rid \nlandfills of their waste, efficiently remove toxins \nfrom our air and water, and provide us with a potentially\nunlimited supply of renewable clean energy."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What applications of plasma are possible?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fusion energy reactors"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cleaning surfaces, such as food surfaces, of pathogens"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Improving the properties of material surfaces"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How much of the universe is made of plasma?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Almost none of it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "31.415%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "More than 99%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When gases are heated enough, what happens?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nothing in particular; they just have more energy in them"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The atoms and molecules break apart to form free electrons and ions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They recombine to form molecules"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vapor is formed that condenses into a liquid"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What does a magnetic field do to a charged particle in a plasma?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Forces the particle to undergo circular orbits"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It stops its motion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The particle changes its charge"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nothing.

{"page": 44, "lesson": 15, "title": "The nerd's guide to learning everything online - John Green", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/fFV0BAV1", "transcript": {"en": "Transcriber: Sara Xiao Fei\nReviewer: Sebastian Betti So, this is a map of New York State that was made in 1937\nby the General Drafting Company. It's an extremely famous map\namong cartography nerds, because down here at the bottom\nof the Catskill Mountains there is a little town called Roscoe - actually, this will go easier\nif I just put it up here - There's Roscoe, and then,\nright above Roscoe, is Rockland, New York, and then right above that\nis the tiny town of Agloe, New York. Agloe, New York,\nis very famous to cartographers, because it's a paper town. It's also known as a copyright trap. Because my map of New York\nand your map of New York are going to look very similar,\non account of the shape of New York. Often, map makers will insert\nfake places onto their maps, in order to protect their copyright,\nbecause then, if my fake place shows up on your map, I can be well and truly sure\nthat you have robbed me. Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials\nof the two guys who made this map Ernest G. Alpers and Otto Lindberg, and they released this map in 1937. Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map with Agloe, New York, on it,\nat the same exact intersection of two dirt roads\nin the middle of nowhere. Well, you can imagine the delight\nover at General Drafting. They immediately called\nRand McNally, and they say, \"We've caught you!\nWe made Agloe, New York, up. It is a fake place. It's a paper town. We're going to sue your pants off!\" And Rand McNally says,\n\"No, no, no, no, Agloe is real.\" Because people kept going\nto that intersection of two dirt roads (Laughter) in the middle of nowhere, expecting there\nto be a place called Agloe, someone built a place\ncalled Agloe, New York. It had a gas station, a general store,\ntwo houses at its peak. (Laughter) And this is of course a completely\nirresistible metaphor to a novelist, because we would all like to believe\nthat the stuff that we write down on paper can change the actual world\nin which we're actually living - which is why my third book\nis called \"Paper Towns\". But what interests me ultimately more\nthan the medium in which this happened is the phenomenon itself. It's easy enough to say that the world\nshapes our maps of the world, right? Like the overall shape of the world\nis obviously going to affect our maps. But what I find a lot\nmore interesting is the way that the manner in which we map\nthe world changes the world. Because the world would truly be\na different place if North were down. And the world would be a truly\ndifferent place if Alaska and Russia weren't on opposite sides of the map. And the world would be a different place if we projected Europe\nto show it in its actual size. The world is changed\nby our maps of the world. The way that we choose to, sort of,\nour personal cartographic enterprise also shapes the map of our lives, and that in turn shapes our lives. I believe that what we map\nchanges the life we lead. And I don't mean that in some, like,\nsecrecy Oprah's Angels network, like, you-can-think-your-way-out\n-of-cancer sense. But I do believe that while maps\ndon't show you where you will go in your life, they show you where you might go. You very rarely go to a place\nthat isn't on your personal map. So I was a really terrible\nstudent when I was a kid. My GPA was consistently in the low 2s, and I think the reason\nthat I was such a terrible student is that I felt like education\nwas just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me, and I had to jump over\nin order to achieve adulthood. And I didn't really want\nto jump over these hurdles, because they seemed completely arbitrary,\nso I often wouldn't, and then people would threaten me,\nyou know, they'd threaten me with\n\"this going on my permanent record\", or \"you'll never get a good job\". I didn't want a good job! As far as I could tell\nat eleven or twelve years old, like, people with good jobs woke up\nvery early in the morning, (Laughter) and the men who had good jobs,\none of the first things they did was tie a strangulation item\nof clothing around their necks. They literally put nooses on themselves, and then they went off to their jobs,\nwhatever they were. That's not a recipe for a happy life. These people - in my, symbol-obsessed,\ntwelve-year-old imagination, these people who are strangling themselves as one of the first things\nthey do each morning, they can't possibly be happy. Why would I want to jump over\nall these hurdles and have that be the end? That's a terrible end! And then, when I was in tenth grade,\nI went to this school, Indian Springs School,\na small boarding school, outside of Birmingham, Alabama, and all at once I became a learner. And I became a learner,\nbecause I found myself in a community of learners. I found myself surrounded by people who celebrated intellectualism\nand engagement, and who thought that my ironic\noh-so-cool disengagement wasn't clever, or funny, but, like, it was a simple\nand unspectacular response to very complicated\nand compelling problems. And so I started to learn,\nbecause learning was cool. I learned that some infinite sets\nare bigger than other infinite sets, and I learned what iambic pentameter is\nand why it sounds so good to human ears. I learned that the Civil War\nwas a nationalizing conflict, I learned some physics, I learned that correlation\nshouldn't be confused with causation - all of these things, by the way, enriched my life\non a literally daily basis. And it's true that I don't use\nmost of them for my \"job\", but that's not what it's about for me. It's about cartography. What is the process of cartography? It's, you know, sailing upon some land,\nand thinking \"I think I'll draw that bit of land\", and then wondering,\n\"Maybe there's some more land to draw\". And that's when learning\nreally began for me. It's true that I had teachers\nthat didn't give up on me, and I was very fortunate\nto have those teachers, because I often gave them cause to think\nthere was no reason to invest in me. But a lot of the learning\nthat I did in high school wasn't about what happened\ninside the classroom, it was about what happened\noutside of the classroom. For instance, I can tell you that, \"There's a certain slant of light,\n[On] winter afternoons, That oppresses, like the heft [weight]\nOf cathedral tunes\", not because I memorized\nEmily Dickinson in school, when I was in high school, but because there was a girl,\nwhen I was in high school, and her name was Amanda, and I had a crush on her,\nand she liked Emily Dickinson poetry. The reason I can tell you\nwhat opportunity cost is, is because one day when I was playing\nSuper Mario Kart on my couch, my friend Emmet walked in, and he said, \"How long have you been playing\nSuper Mario Kart?\", and I said, \"I don't know,\nlike, six hours?\", and he said, \"You realize that if you'd worked\nat Baskin-Robbins those six hours, you could have made thirty dollars,\nso in some ways, you just paid thirty dollars\nto play Super Mario Kart\", and I was, like, \"I'll take that deal.\"\n(Laughter) But I learned what opportunity cost is, and along the way, the map of my life got better,\nit got bigger, it contained more places. There were more things that might happen,\nmore futures I might have. It wasn't a formal\norganized learning process, and I'm happy to admit that. It was spotty, it was inconsistent,\nthere was a lot I didn't know. I might know, you know,\nthat Cantor's idea that some infinite sets are larger\nthan other infinite sets, but I didn't really understand\nthe calculus behind that idea. I might know the idea of opportunity cost, but I didn't know the law\nof diminishing returns. But the great thing about imagining\nlearning as cartography, instead of imagining it\nas arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over is that you see a bit of coast line,\nand that makes you want to see more. And so now I do know\nat least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff. So, I had one learning community\nin high school, then I went to another for college, and then I went to another,\nwhen I started working at a magazine called \"Booklist\", where I was an assistant surrounded by astonishingly\nwell-read people, and then I wrote a book,\nand like all authors dream of doing, I promptly quit my job. And for the first time since high school, I found myself\nwithout a learning community, and it was miserable. I hated it. I read many, many books\nduring this two-year period. I read books about Stalin, and books about how the Uzbek people\ncame to identify as Muslims, and I read books about\nhow to make atomic bombs, but it just felt like\nI was creating my own hurdles, and then jumping over them myself,\ninstead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners,\na community of people who are engaged together\nin a cartographic enterprise of trying to better understand\nand map the world around us. And then, in 2006, I met that guy. His name is Ze Frank. I didn't actually meet him,\njust on the Internet. Ze Frank was running, at the time,\na show called \"The Show with Ze Frank\", and that was my way back\ninto being a community learner again. Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas: (Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built\nin the middle of a huge hot desert, almost everything here\nwas brought from somewhere else - the sort of rocks,\nthe trees, the waterfalls. These fish are almost as out of place\nas my pig that flew. Contrasted to the scorching desert\nthat surrounds this place, so are these people. Things from all over the world\nhave been rebuilt here, away from their histories, and the people\nthat experience them differently. Sometimes, improvements were made. Even the Sphinx got a nose job. Here, what you see is what you get, and there's no reason to feel\nlike you're missing anything. This New York means the same to me\nas it does to everyone else. Everything is out of context, and that means\ncontext allows for everything. Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef. This fabrication of place could be one\nof the world's greatest achievements, because no one belongs here,\neveryone does. As I walked around this morning,\nI noticed most of the buildings were huge mirrors reflecting\nthe sun back into the desert. But unlike most mirrors,\nwhich present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place,\nthese mirrors come back empty. John Green:\nIt makes me nostalgic for the days when you could see\nthe pixels in online video. (Laughter) Ze isn't just a great public intellectual,\nhe's also a brilliant community builder, and the community of people that built up around these videos was in many ways\na community of learners, so we played Ze Frank at chess\ncollaboratively, and we beat him. We organized ourselves to take a young man\non a road trip across the United States. We turned the Earth into a sandwich by having one person hold a piece of bread\nat one point on the Earth, and on the exact opposite point\nof the Earth having another person\nholding a piece of bread. I realize that these are silly ideas,\nbut they are also 'learny' ideas, and that was what was so exciting to me, and if you go online, you can find\ncommunities like this all over the place. Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr,\nand yes, you will see people complaining\nabout calculus, but you'll also see people\nre-blogging those complaints, making the argument that calculus\nis interesting and beautiful, and here's a way in to thinking about\nthe problem that you find unsolvable. You can go to places like Reddit,\nand find sub-Reddits, like 'Ask a Historian', or 'Ask Science', where you can ask people\nwho are in these fields a wide range of questions, from very serious ones to very silly ones. But to me, the most interesting\ncommunities of learners that are growing up on the Internet\nright now are on YouTube, and admittedly I am biased. But I think in a lot of ways,\nthe YouTube page resembles a classroom. Look for instance at \"Minute Physics\", a guy who's teaching\nthe world about physics. (Video) Let's cut to the chase. As of July 4th, 2012, the Higgs Boson\nis the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics\nto be discovered experimentally. But, you might ask,\nwhy was the Higgs Boson included in the standard model, alongside well-known particles\nlike electrons and photons and quarks, if it hadn't been discovered\nback then in the 1970s? Good question.\nThere are two main reasons. First, just like the electron\nis an excitation in the electron field, the Higgs Boson is simply a particle\nwhich is an excitation of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field. The Higgs field in turn\nplays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force. In particular, the Higgs field\nhelps explain why it's so weak. We'll talk more about this\nin a later video, but even though weak nuclear theory\nwas confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations, the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled\nwith the weak force, that until now we've been unable\nto confirm its actual and independent existence. JG: Or here's a video that I made as part of my show \"Crash Course\",\ntalking about World War I: (Video) The immediate cause was of course\nthe assassination in Sarajevo of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,\non June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb nationalist\nnamed Gavrilo Princip. Quick aside: it's worth noting\nthat the first big war of the twentieth century\nbegan with an act of terrorism. So Franz Ferdinand\nwasn't particularly well-liked by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph - now that is a moustache! - but even so, the assassination led Austria\nto issue an ultimatum to Serbia, whereupon Serbia accepted some,\nbut not all, of Austria's demands, leading Austria to declare\nwar against Serbia. And then Russia, due to its alliance\nwith the Serbs, mobilized its army. Germany, because it had an alliance\nwith Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizing, which Russia failed to do,\nso then Germany mobilized its own army, declared war on Russia,\ncemented an alliance with the Ottomans, and then declared war on France,\nbecause, you know - France! (Laughter) And it's not just physics\nand world history that people are choosing to learn\nthrough YouTube. Here's a video about abstract mathematics. (Video) So you're me,\nand you're in math class yet again, because they make you go,\nlike, every single day. And you're learning about, I don't know,\nthe sums of infinite series. That's a high school topic, right?\nWhich is odd, because it's a cool topic, but they\nsomehow manage to ruin it anyway. So I guess that's why they allow\ninfinite series in the curriculum. So, in a quite understandable need\nfor distraction, you're doodling and thinking more about what the plural of \"series\" should be\nthan about the topic at hand. \"Serieses,\" \"seriese,\"\n\"seriesen,\" and \"serii?\" Or is it that the singular\nshould be changed? One \"serie,\" or \"serus,\" or \"serum?\" Just like the singular\nof \"sheep\" should be \"shoop.\" But the whole concept of things like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on,\napproaching one, is useful if, say, you want\nto draw a line of elephants each holding the tail of the next one: normal elephant, young elephant,\nbaby elephant, dog-sized elephant,\npuppy-sized elephant... All the way down to Mr. Tusks and beyond. Which is at least a tiny bit awesome, because you can get an infinite number\nof elephants in a line and still have it fit across\na single notebook page. JG: And lastly, here's Destin,\nfrom \"Smarter Every Day\", talking about the conservation\nof angular momentum and, since it's YouTube, cats: (Video) Hey, it's me, Destin.\nWelcome back to \"Smarter Every Day\". So you've probably observed that cats\nalmost always land on their feet. Today's question is why? Like most simple questions,\nthere's a very complex answer. For instance, let me\nreword this question: How does a cat go from feet up\nto feet down in a falling reference frame without violating the conservation\nof angular momentum? JG: So, here's something\nall of these videos have in common: they all have more than\nhalf a million views on YouTube. And those are people\nwatching not in classrooms, but because they are part\nof the communities of learning that are being set up\nby these channels. And I said earlier that YouTube\nis like a classroom to me, and in many ways it is,\nbecause here is the instructor - it's like the old-fashioned classroom -\nhere's the instructor, and then beneath the instructor\nis the students, and they're all having a conversation. And I know that YouTube Comments have a very bad reputation\nin the world of the Internet, but in fact, if you go\non comments for these channels, what you'll find is people\nengaging the subject matter, asking difficult, complicated questions\nthat are about the subject matter, and then other people\nanswering those questions. And because the YouTube page is set up so that the place\nin which I'm talking to you is on the exact same page as your comments,\nyou are participating in a live and real and active way\nin the conversation. And because I'm in comments usually,\nI get to participate with you, and you find this\nwhether it's world history, or mathematics, or science,\nor whatever it is. You also see young people using the tools and the sort of genres of the Internet\nin order to create places for intellectual engagement\ninstead of the ironic detachment that maybe most of us associate\nwith memes and other Internet conventions, you know \"Got bored - Invented calculus\", or here's Honey Boo Boo\ncriticizing industrial capitalism [\"Liberal capitalism is not at all\nthe Good of humanity. Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle\nof savage destructive nihilism\"]. In case you can't see what she says...\nYeah. I really believe that\nthese spaces, these communities have become, for a new generation\nof learners, the kind of communities,\nthe kind of cartographic communities that I had when I was in high school,\nand then again when I was in college. And as an adult,\nre-finding these communities has re-introduced me\nto a community of learners, and has encouraged me to continue\nto be a learner even in my adulthood, so that I no longer feel like learning\nis something reserved for the young. Vi Hart and \"Minute Physics\" introduced me to all kinds of things\nthat I didn't know before. And I know that we all hearken back to the days of the Parisian salon\nin the Enlightenment, or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish, \"Oh, I wish I could have been\na part of that, I wish I could have laughed\nat Dorothy Parker's jokes\". But I'm here to tell you\nthat these places exist, they still exist. They exist in corners of the Internet,\nwhere old men fear to tread. (Laughter) And I truly, truly believe that when\nwe invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s, when we made Agloe real,\nwe were just getting started. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

After all, you're the human around here. You're an intelligent being,\nnot a simple creature of instinct. You can plan and dream, and oh- Did your dog just outsmart you\nand feel happy about it? Or was he just following his instincts? Is there even a difference? What is he thinking? Well, it depends on \nwhat we mean by \"thinking\" and the criteria we use to evaluate it. Aristotle and Descartes both use \nthe criteria of instinct and intelligence to divide animals from humans. Aristotle believed \nthat humans possess reason, while animals could only follow brute\ninstincts for survival and reproduction. Almost 2000 years later, Descartes suggested \na more extreme version of that idea, arguing that animals following instincts\nwere indistinguishable from robots responding mechanically \nto stimuli in their environments. But the consensus against animal \nintelligence began to unravel with Darwin's Theory of Evolution. Darwin hypothesized that intelligence\ncould evolve from simpler instincts. He had observed earthworms making choices\nabout how to drag oddly shaped leaves into their boroughs, and was struck that a human might employ\nsimilar means to solve a similar problem. And if, as he thought, humans \nare descended from simpler creatures, then perhaps our minds lie\nat the far end of a continuum, differing from theirs in degree,\nbut not in kind. Recent experiments showing that many\nspecies can solve complex problems confirm Darwin's initial hypothesis. Elephants use objects to reach\ninaccessible places. Crows make their own tools, and can use water displacement \nto get a reward. Octopuses can open jars \nafter watching others do so, and can even remember \nthe process months later. Such tasks involve considering \naspects of a problem separately from the immediate situation,\nand retaining the strategy for later use. Still, while animals \ncan solve complex problems, how do we know what, or even that, \nthey are thinking? Behaviorists, such as Pavlov\nand Thorndike, argue that animals that appear to think are usually only responding \nto reward or punishment. This was the case with Clever Hans, a horse with the amazing ability\nto tap out answers to math problems. But it turns out Hans \nwasn't especially good at math, but at reading his unwitting \ntrainer's subtle nonverbal cues for when to stop tapping. So Hans couldn't count,\nbut does that mean he wasn't thinking? After all, he could interpret \nnuanced social messages, a quality he shared with many other\nnon-human animals. Elephants recognize each other\nafter years apart, and even seem to mourn their dead. Bees communicate \nusing a special waggle dance to indicate the location and quality \nof a food source to other bees. Chimpanzees engage \nin complex deception schemes, suggesting not only do they think,\nbut they understand that others do, too. And then there is Alex the Grey Parrot, who could use human language to distinguish the colors \nand shapes of absent objects, and even understand abstract concepts,\nlike bigger and smaller. That sounds a lot like intelligence, and not just the work \nof mindless machines. But while a non-human animal can solve\nproblems and even communicate, for humans, thinking \nalso involves consciousness, the ability to reflect on our actions,\nnot simply to perform them. So far, none of our studies tell us\nif having the intelligence to outsmart us means that our dog \ncan also feel good about doing so. What we really want to know is\nwhat is it like to be a dog, or an octopus, or a crow? Philosophers of mind call this\nThe Hard Problem, because while you and I can report\nwhat it feels like to be a human, nobody speaks horse. Even a talking parrot, like Alex, couldn't tell us how he feels \nabout the colors he could name. And what if consciousness \ncomes in different forms? Would we even recognize \nthe consciousness of bees? For that matter, how can we know for sure\nthat other people have consciouness? Perhaps they're just \nwell-functioning zombies. Regardless, animal minds continue to test\nthe limits of our understanding and how we frame them may reveal more\nabout our minds than theirs."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following criteria did Aristotle and Descartes use to distinguish animals from humans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Instinct"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Intelligence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tool use"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A & B"}, {"label": "E", "text": "B & C"}, {"label": "F", "text": "C & D"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Charles Darwin's theory of evolution allowed for what insight into the question of animal intelligence?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Human and nonhuman animals probably think more similarly than differently"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Human and nonhuman animals solve problems very differently"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only humans can remember and learn"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nonhuman animals are driven solely by their instincts"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "From a behaviorist perspective, which of the following would seem to be true?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "What we think of as \"intelligence\" is probably better understood as a response to an external stimulus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Many human behaviors might simply be the result of responses to stimuli"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nonhuman animal intelligence might be an illusion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is difficult to prove that nonhuman animals \"think\""}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Consciousness--the ability to reflect on or experience one's own actions--is sometimes called the \"hard problem\" among philosophers of mind.

{"page": 44, "lesson": 20, "title": "Jean-Paul Sartre and Existentialism", "category": "Philosophy & Religion", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/07ZG16ZY", "transcript": {"en": "Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy\nglamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,\na navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until\nshe remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where\nhe often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore\ndistinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described\nhimself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name\nin both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book\nBeing and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people\ncould understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of\nkey insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when\nthe world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments\nwhen the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be\nhighly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published\nin 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,\na 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls\nit back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely\nworth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,\nthe object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never\nseen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is\nsomething for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre\ncalls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s\nphilosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped\nof any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many\naspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly\nlogical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness\nlurking beneath. Dinner really means that:\nwhen your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and\nhelium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up\ntree and put sections of dead animals and plants\nin your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals\nyou sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting\nand rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:\nbecause of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s\nalso as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they\nare. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.\nEverything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense\nor purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,\nand are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living\nwithout taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves\nthat things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to\ndo a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given\nplace. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’\ncomes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly\ndevoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human\nbeing. His movement is quick and forward, a little\ntoo precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a\nlittle too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an\ninterest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone\nin Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily\na waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North\nSea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.\nMost of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,\nleaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged\nSartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to\ncreate a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work\na certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom\n– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other\nways. It was because of these views that Sartre\nhad a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore\ntheir freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets\nof Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him\npardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara\nand admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,\nthe FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might\nreally mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that\nthings do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,\nas individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks\nand ideas.

{"page": 44, "lesson": 23, "title": "How do pregnancy tests work? - Tien Nguyen", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-pregnancy-tests-work-tien-nguyen", "transcript": {"en": "The earliest known pregnancy test\ndates back to 1350 BC in Ancient Egypt. According to the Egyptians, all you have to do is urinate on wheat \nand barley seeds, and wait. If either sprouts, \ncongratulations, you're pregnant! And if wheat sprouts faster, it's a girl,\nbut if barley, it's a boy. In 1963, a small study \nreproduced this test and found that it predicted pregnancy\nwith a respectable 70% accuracy, though it couldn't reliably \ntell the sex of the baby. Scientists hypothesized \nthat the test worked because pregnant women's urine\ncontains more estrogen, which can promote seed growth. Now it's easy to take \nthis ancient method for granted because modern pregnancy tests give\nhighly accurate results within minutes. So how do they work? Over-the-counter pregnancy tests\nare all designed to detect one thing: a hormone called HCG. HCG is produced in \nthe earliest stages of pregnancy and starts a game of telephone that tells the body not to shed \nthe inner lining of the uterus that month. As the pregnancy progresses, HCG supports the formation\nof the placenta, which transfers nutrients \nfrom mother to fetus. The test starts when urine is applied\nto the exposed end of the strip. As the fluid travels up \nthe absorbent fibers, it will cross three separate zones,\neach with an important task. When the wave hits the first zone,\nthe reaction zone, Y-shaped proteins called antibodies\nwill grab onto any HCG. Attached to these antibodies\nis a handy enzyme with the ability to turn on dye molecules,\nwhich will be crucial later down the road. Then the urine picks up \nall the AB1 enzymes and carries them to the test zone,\nwhich is where the results show up. Secured to this zone are more\nY-shaped antibodies that will also stick to HCG\non one of its five binding sites. Scientists call this type of test\na sandwich assay. If HCG is present, it gets sandwiched\nbetween the AB1 enzyme and AB2, and sticks to the test zone, allowing the attached dye-activating\nenzyme to do its job and create a visible pattern. If there's no HCG, the wave of urine\nand enzymes just passes on by. Finally, there's one last stop to make,\nthe control zone. As in any good experiment, this step confirms that \nthe test is working properly. Whether the AB1 enzymes never saw HCG, or they're extras because Zone 1\nis overstocked with them, all the unbound AB1 enzymes picked up\nin Zone 1 should end up here and activate more dye. So if no pattern appears,\nthat indicates that the test was faulty. These tests are pretty reliable,\nbut they're not failproof. For instance, false negatives can occur if concentrations of HCG \naren't high enough for detection. After implantation, HCG levels double\nevery two to three days, so it may just be too early to tell. And beverages can dilute the urine sample, which is why doctors recommend taking\nthe test first thing in the morning. On the other hand, false positives\ncan come from other sources of HCG, like IVF injections, ectopic pregnancies, or certain cancers such as uterine cancer\nor testicular cancer, making it possible for one of these tests\nto tell a man he's pregnant. The best way for a woman to find out \nfor sure is at the doctor's office. The doctors are also looking for HCG, but with tests that are more sensitive\nand quantitative, which means they can determine\nthe exact level of HCG in your blood. A few minutes can feel like forever when you're waiting on the results \nof a pregnancy test. But in that brief time, you're witnessing\nthe power of the scientific method. That one little stick \nlets you ask a question, perform a controlled experiment, and then analyze the results\nto check your original hypothesis. And the best part is you won't even\nhave to wait until the next harvest."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is not true about human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is produced in the earliest stages of pregnancy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Levels of hCG in the body double every 2-3 days"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Men cannot produce the hCG hormone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pregnancy tests work by detecting hCG"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which zone contains antibodies that can become dissolved in urine and pushed along the strip?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The reaction zone"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The test zone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The control zone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What can give a false positive?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In vitro fertilization injections"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ectopic pregnancies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Uterine cancer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What happens in the control zone of the test?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Reaction zone antibodies bind to hCG"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reaction zone antibodies get stuck here and activate dye molecules"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Reaction zone antibodies, hCG and test zone antibodies bind to make a \"sandwich\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reaction zone antibodies get picked up and pushed along the stick by the urine"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which zone does not contain any dye molecules waiting to be activated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The reaction zone"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The test zone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The control zone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
