Sotomayor", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-does-your-body-know-what-time-it-is-marco-a-sotomayor", "transcript": {"en": "In 1962, a cave explorer \nnamed Michel Siffre started a series of experiments where\nhe isolated himself underground for months without light or clocks. He attached himself to electrodes\nthat monitored his vital signs and kept track of when he slept and ate. When Siffre finally emerged, the results of his pioneering experiments revealed that his body had kept\nto a regular sleeping-waking cycle. Despite having no external cues, he fell asleep, woke up, and ate at fixed intervals. This became known as a circadian rhythm\nfrom the Latin for \"about a day.\" Scientists later found these rhythms\naffect our hormone secretion, how our bodies process food, and even the effects \nof drugs on our bodies. The field of sciences studying\nthese changes is called chronobiology. Being able to sense time helps us do\neverything from waking and sleeping to knowing precisely when to catch a ball\nthat's hurtling towards us. We owe all these abilities to \nan interconnected system of timekeepers in our brains. It contains the equivalent of a stopwatch\ntelling us how many seconds elapsed, a clock counting the hours of the day, and a calendar notifying us \nof the seasons. Each one is located in \na different brain region. Siffre, stuck in his dark cave, relied\non the most primitive clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN\nof the hypothalamus. Here's the basics of how we think it works\nbased on fruitfly and mouse studies. Proteins known as CLK, or clock,\naccumulate in the SCN throughout the day. In addition to activating genes\nthat tell us to stay awake, they make another protein called PER. When enough PER accumulates, it deactivates the gene that makes CLK, eventually making us fall asleep. Then, clock falls low, so PER \nconcentrations also drop again, allowing CLK to rise, starting the cycle over. There are other proteins involved, but our day and night cycle may be driven\nin part by this seesaw effect between CLK by day and PER by night. For more precision, our SCNs also rely \non external cues like light, food, noise, and temperature. We called these zeitgebers, German for \"givers of time.\" Siffre lacked many \nof these cues underground, but in normal life, they fine tune\nour daily behavior. For instance, as natural morning light\nfilters into our eyes, it helps wake us up. Traveling through the optic nerve\nto the SCN, it communicates what's happening\nin the outside world. The hypothalamus then halts\nthe production of melatonin, a hormone that triggers sleep. At the same time, it increases the production\nof vasopressin and noradrenaline throughout the brain, which help control our sleep cycles. At about 10 am, the body's rising temperature drives up\nour energy and alertness, and later in the afternoon, it also improves our muscle activity\nand coordination. Bright screens at night can confuse\nthese signals, which is why binging on TV before bed\nmakes it harder to sleep. But sometimes we need to be\neven more precise when telling the time, which is where the brain's internal \nstopwatch chimes in. One theory for how this works \ninvolves the fact that communication between a given\npair of neurons always takes roughly the same\namount of time. So neurons in our cortex \nand other brain areas may communicate in scheduled,\npredictable loops that the cortex uses to judge\nwith precision how much time has passed. That creates our perception of time. In his cave, Siffre made a fascinating\nadditional discovery about this. Every day, he challenged himself \nto count up to 120 at the rate of one digit per second. Over time, instead of taking two minutes,\nit began taking him as long as five. Life in the lonely, dark cave had warped\nSiffre's own perception of time despite his brain's best efforts\nto keep him on track. This makes us wonder what else influences\nour sense of time. And if time isn't objective, \nwhat does that mean? Could each of us \nbe experiencing it differently? Only time will tell."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where in our brains is our most primitive clock?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Brain cortex"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Basal ganglia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Suprachiasmatic nucleus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cerebellum"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "To increase precision, our brain takes cues from the outside world such as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Light and food"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Heat and wind"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Music and food"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Light and study"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "To stay awake, our brain increases the production of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Melatonin and noradrenaline"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Vasopressin and melatonin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Vasopressin and noradrenaline"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Serotonin and melatonin"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Where is the stopwatch in our brain believed to reside?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Brain cortex"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Basal ganglia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Suprachiasmatic nucleus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cerebellum"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which are the main proteins in the circadian rhythm?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "PER and LGT"}, {"label": "B", "text": "CLK and SCN"}, {"label": "C", "text": "LGT and SCN"}, {"label": "D", "text": "PER and CLK"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Despite six months of double checking,\nthe bizarre discovery refused to yield. But rather than celebrating \na physics revolution, the researchers published a cautious paper arguing for continued research in an\neffort to explain the observed anomaly. In time, the error was tracked to a single\nincorrectly connected fiber optic cable. This example reminds us that real\nscience is more than static textbooks. Instead, researchers around the world\nare continuously publishing their latest discoveries with each paper adding \nto the scientific conversation. Published studies \ncan motivate future research, inspire new products, and inform government policy. So it's important that we have confidence\nin the published results. If their conclusions are wrong, we risk time, resources, and even our health in the pursuit\nof false leads. When findings are significant, they are frequently double-checked\nby other researchers, either by reanalyzing the data or by redoing the entire experiment. For example, it took repeated \ninvestigation of the CERN data before the timing error was tracked down. Unfortunately, there are currently neither\nthe resources nor professional incentives to double check the more than 1 million\nscientific papers published annually. Even when papers are challenged,\nthe results are not reassuring. Recent studies that examined dozens\nof published pharmaceutical papers managed to replicate the results of\nless than 25% of them. And similar results have been found\nin other scientific disciplines. There are a variety of sources \nfor irreproducible results. Errors could hide in their original\ndesign, execution, or analysis of the data. Unknown factors, such as patients' undisclosed condition\nin a medical study, can produce results that are \nnot repeatable in new test subjects. And sometimes, the second research group\ncan't reproduce the original results simply because they don't know\nexactly what the original group did. However, some problems might stem\nfrom systematic decisions in how we do science. Researchers, the institutions that employ them, and the scientific journals \nthat publish findings are expected to produce \nbig results frequently. Important papers can advance careers, generate media interest, and secure essential funding, so there's slim motivation for researchers\nto challenge their own exciting results. In addition, little incentive exists to publish results unsupportive\nof the expected hypothesis. That results in a deluge of agreement\nbetween what was expected and what was found. In rare occasions, this can even lead\nto deliberate fabrication, such as in 2013, when a researcher\nspiked rabbit blood with human blood to give false evidence that \nhis HIV vaccine was working. The publish or perish mindset can also compromise academic journals'\ntraditional peer-review processes which are safety checks where experts examine submitted papers\nfor potential shortcomings. The current system, which might involve only one\nor two reviewers, can be woefully ineffective. That was demonstrated in a 1998 study where eight weaknesses were deliberately\ninserted into papers, but only around 25% \nwere caught upon review. Many scientists are working toward\nimproving reproducibility in their fields. There's a push to make researchers\nraw data, experimental procedures, and analytical techniques \nmore openly available in order to ease replication efforts. The peer review process can also\nbe strengthened to more efficiently weed out weak papers\nprior to publication. And we could temper the pressure\nto find big results by publishing more papers that fail\nto confirm the original hypothesis, an event that happens far more than\ncurrent scientific literature suggests. Science always has, and always will,\nencounter some false starts as part of the collective acquisition\nof new knowledge. Finding ways to improve \nthe reproducibility of our results can help us weed out those false starts\nmore effectively, keeping us moving steadily toward\nexciting new discoveries."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What unexpected event did CERN researchers ultimately track down due to an experimental error?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They observed an isolated object gaining mass over time"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They discovered an element with a ‘half-neutron’"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They measured an object moving faster than the speed of light"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They discovered a previously unknown form of matter"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not a possible cause of irreproducible results?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Faults in the original data collection"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Errors in the original data analysis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Incomplete directions to follow when attempting to reproduce the results"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Any of the above are possible"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What does the phrase “Publish or Perish” refer to?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A scientist is often judged by the papers that they publish in scientific journals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "If a scientist does not publish their results quickly, someone else might beat them to it"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A scientist is responsible for publishing their own results on their personal website"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Failure to properly cite published sources can lead to a scientist’s dismissal"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is “Peer Review”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A morale-building exercise that all university researchers attend yearly camps for"}, {"label": "B", "text": "When other scientists check research results before giving a thumbs-up for publication"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A British sitcom popular among scientists that pokes fun at research in general"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A U.S. law passed in 2013 requiring all scientists to register in a national database"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT at least a partial potential remedy for irreproducibility?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Encourage research techniques to be openly available to review"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Improve the peer-review process"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Require all scientists to pay journals before their results can be published"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Publish more papers that do not show ‘big results'"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Schorr", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-airplane-riddle-judd-a-schorr", "transcript": {"en": "Professor Fukanō, the famous \neccentric scientist and adventurer, has embarked on a new challenge: flying around the world nonstop\nin a plane of his own design. Able to travel consistently at the\nincredible speed of one degree longitude around the equator per minute, the plane would take six hours\nto circle the world. There's just one problem: the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters\nof fuel, only enough for exactly half the journey. Let's be honest. The professor probably could have\ndesigned the plane to hold more fuel, but where's the fun in that? Instead, he's devised a slightly more\nelaborate solution: building three identical planes\nfor the mission. In addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them\nwith a few other incredible features. Each of the planes can turn on a dime and instantly transfer any amount\nof its fuel to any of the others in midair without slowing down, provided they're next to each other. The professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants Fugōri\nand Orokana will pilot each of the others. However, only one airport,\nlocated on the equator, has granted permission for the experiment, making it the starting point, the finish line, and the only spot where \nthe planes can land, takeoff, or refuel on the ground. How should the three planes coordinate so the professor can fly continuously\nfor the whole trip and achieve his dream without anyone running out \nof fuel and crashing? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 According to the professor's calculations, they should be able to pull it off\nby a hair. The key is to maximize the support\neach assistant provides, not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel. It also helps us to think symmetrically so they can make shorter trips\nin either direction while setting the professor up for a long\nunsupported stretch in the middle. Here's his solution. All three planes take off at noon\nflying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters. After 45 minutes, or one-eighth\nof the way around, each plane has 135 kiloliters left. Orokana gives 45 to the professor\nand 45 to Fugōri, fully refueling them both. With her remaining 45, \nOrokana returns to the airport and heads to the lounge\nfor a well-deserved break. 45 minutes later, with one-quarter\nof the trip complete, the professor and Fugōri\nare both at 135 kiloliters again. Fugōri transfers 45 \ninto the professor's tank, leaving himself with the 90\nhe needs to return. Professor Fukanō stretches\nand puts on his favorite album. He'll be alone for a while. In the meantime, Orokana has been\nanxiously awaiting Fugōri's return, her plane fully refueled and ready to go. As soon as his plane touches the ground,\nshe takes off, this time flying east. At this point, exactly 180 minutes \nhave passed and the professor is at the halfway point\nof his journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel left. For the next 90 minutes, the professor and Orokana's planes \nfly towards each other, meeting at the three-quarter mark. Just as the professor's fuel \nis about the run out, he sees Orokana's plane. She gives him 45 kiloliters \nof her remaining 90, leaving them with 45 each. But that's just half of what they need\nto make it to the airport. Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri,\nhaving refueled, takes off. 45 minutes later, just as the other two\nplanes are about to run empty, he meets them at the 315 degree point and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel\nto each, leaving 45 for himself. All three planes land at the airport\njust as their fuel gauges reach zero. As the reporters and photographers cheer, the professor promises his planes will\nsoon be available for commercial flights, just as soon as they figure out how \nto keep their inflight meals from spilling everywhere."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many degrees of longitude is the entire Earth divided into?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "60"}, {"label": "B", "text": "360"}, {"label": "C", "text": "600"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1600"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How much total fuel (in kiloliters) is contained within all three airplanes when combined at the beginning of this trip?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "180"}, {"label": "B", "text": "270"}, {"label": "C", "text": "360"}, {"label": "D", "text": "540"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the key to completing the mission of flying around the world in one airplane?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Maximizing the support each assistance provides"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Landing and taking off safely"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Refueling on the ground frequently"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What makes this riddle easier to solve?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Thinking symmetrically"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Thinking of the earth as a circle divided into degrees"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Realising the plane is traveling at the speed of 1degree longitude/minute"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The professor is flying but is only half way around the world with 90 kiloliters of fuel left.

{"page": 35, "lesson": 5, "title": "How bird vomit helps us understand history", "category": "Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/iVG1evdO", "transcript": {"en": "What if I told you that this 10,000-year-old owl pellet can hold crucial information for preserving the future of Australia's fragile ecosystems? It's true. The specimen along with a 100,000 others\nwas collected by Field curator Bill Turnbull from the Nullarbor plain region of\nsouthern Australia in the 1950s. And today, its information is being used\nto help perserve Australian habitats. Here's the neat thing about this\ncongealed bird vomit. Nocturnal raptors like owls primarily feed\non rodents and they eat a lot to satisfy their dietary needs. The bones and fur aren't digested\nso those parts are regurgitated in the form of pellets. Some owl species return to the same\nroosting sites for generations regurgitating pellets in massive piles\nover a period of many years and luckily for us, a few of these sites\nhave been preserved in caves and sheltered from the elements. So in the last tens to hundreds of thousands\nof years, these large owl pellet accumulations have given paleontologists a phenomenal record\nfor what sort of rodents were historically found in the region. And just like how fossil life is stratified in layers\nof rock, the ages of rodents too become stratified the deeper you dig in these massive\npiles of raptor pellets. So, why are so interested in this information? Well, in the last 200 years since European\nsettlement in Australia, the country has experienced an alarming\nrate of mammal extinction. Greated than any other continent. Since there's no written record of what the\nmammal diversity of Australia looked like before Europeans arrived, scientists have\nto be creative with interpreting the country's plant and animal history, which in this case means sorting through\nthese raptor pellets as a great starting point. This gives scientists a way to look at the past in order to help shape the future. And I've got a ton of questions about this, so recently we sat down with Dr. Matthew McDowell,\na post-doctoral researcher at Flinders University in South Australia\nto learn more about his work as a paleoecologist and his affection\nfor raptor pallets. [Dr. McDowell:] This is a sample of the kind of thing\nthat gets scooped up off of the floor of a cave with the fine dust gotten rid of.\n[Emily:] Okay. [Dr. McDowell:] Now, that's usually made up\nof things like this – an owl has eaten and then regurgitated before it flies out\nto go hunting the next night. We don't have any of the really fresh ones\nbut they're all very glossy and mucus-covered, and... Yeah. May be gross, but... [Emily:] Kind of fun stuff.\n[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. This has been washed pretty well except\nfor these chunks on top which have been kept so that you\ncan see what it looked like. [Emily:] And then, when you have all of this\nmaterial, you're taking a pile like this and you're having to sort through all of it to figure out the species under there. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. That's best\ndone with the teeth. For a couple of reasons. They're the most durable part\nof an animal's body, so they last the longest. But they're also complex shapes because different\nfood is best processed by different types of teeth. And then you get to the stage here where you've only got\nthe bits that are easily identified which are mainly teeth and jaws. Once we go from these, we identify them,\nwe work out whether it's the left or the right specimen, what kind of species it is, then it goes to this stage where\nit gets put in a vial with a label. [Emily:] With its own number.\n[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, with its own number. Individually, usually individually, sometimes in a lot if you've got millions of them like we do in this case. And that one's got all of its teeth. So that\nwould be an easy one to identify. [Emily:] What is it?\n[Dr. McDowell:] I don't know, I haven't got a microscope. [Emily:] Oh. [Emily:] So, through the process of what seems like a really gross thing, which is sorting through owl vomit, you're able to look at what sort of rodents and\nsmall animals used to be living in an area. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah.\n[Emily:] That's amazing. [Dr. McDowell:] The longest continuous history\nthat I've done this for is on Kangaroo Island and it's continuously collecting owl pellets\nfor 150,000 years. [Emily:] Are you serious? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, just piled on top of\neach other all the way through time. [Emily:] So how has this information that\nyou've learned about all of the species and diversity of these caves from\nrelatively long time ago – how has that changed in the last 200 years\nsince Europeans have been in Australia? Dr. McDowell:] Oh, that's a great question. Europeans in Australia were, I think justifiably, more interested in feeding their family by clearing a heap of land and planting wheat than they were in what little animals used to live there. You can learn just how much damage\nwe did to the environment by comparing fossils that are maybe\nonly 300 or 400 years old to what should be living in the area today. My opinion is that those young fossils are a much better\nindicator of what should be living in a park or a place today, than the animals\nthat are living there right now. [Emily:] Ultimately, what do you do with\nthis information, now that you know what is in a particular cave or a region? [Dr. McDowell:] Well, we can use it to\nwork out a number of different things. From very young fossils we can work out\nwhat should be in the national parks, typically in Australia there will be three or\nfour native mammals in a national park, but if you look at the fossil record, there's 20 to 25 native mammals\nthat should be there. We can also use it to look at how climates\nhave changed through time and then we can take that information that\nwe've learned from conditions in the past being represented by different animals, and we can then make predictive\nmodels to ask ourselves, 'Well, if the climate conditions were like this, what animal would be expected to live in the area in the future?' And that is in terms of conservation\nmanagement really important. You know, we can spend a million dollars\non a park and make it beautiful and find that's it's only actually useful\nfor a hundred years. If I'm doing conservation, I think we should get at least\na thousand years out of our million bucks. [Emily:] What kind of challenges have you run into\nwhen trying to advocate for rodents? Because they're not exactly the most,\nuh, charismatic species... I mean people can get behind saving pandas\nand tigers, but when you tell them that there's a rare rat living in an area,\nhow do they respond? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, so it is difficult\nto champion a rodent, but it's really easy to sell climate change. These little animals live for only a couple of years,\nso they're very sensitive to their environment. And they move with the climate\nand sort of habitat envelope, by that I mean, you know, if you've got\nan overlayer of the right kind of plants, and the right temperature, the right kind of soil, all of those factors play into where an animal will live, and as climate changes, they move. They also do things that help the\ncommunity to be supported, so some might cache seeds and\nforget where they buried them so some of those seeds will germinate\nand grow into plants that had the best possible start, because\nthat will put them to moist fluffy ground because it's been dug up. Some might shift fungal spores\naround, which help other plants... Fungus often grows on plant roots and it's much\nbetter at collecting water than tree roots are. So without a lot of these animals that dig, you lose a lot of that functionality, you know, in a community, and all of the ecology is damaged by that. And it makes it less stable, more\neasily broken by climate change. And also, it means that if you want to\nkeep it, you have to spend more money. So, much better to start with something\nthat's good and well supported, and, you know, put a little bit of money\ninto it and keep it ticking over than to go, 'Oh no, we've only got 13 more\nnorthern hairy-nosed wombats left, we have to throw millions of dollars at it\nto make sure it doesn't go extinct.' [Emily:] 'Oh noo!' It's kinda late at that point.\n[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. [Emily:] So this cave deposit material,\nis this primarily unique to Australia, or is there a chance that there would be\nstuff like this found in any country? [Dr. McDowell:] That's a really good question. The animals in different countries change but very\nmuch the processes stay the same.

Today's computers can beat us\nin complex board games, transcribe speech in dozens of languages, and instantly identify almost any object. But the robots of tomorrow may go futher by learning to figure out \nwhat we're feeling. And why does that matter? Because if machines \nand the people who run them can accurately read our emotional states, they may be able to assist us\nor manipulate us at unprecedented scales. But before we get there, how can something so complex as emotion\nbe converted into mere numbers, the only language machines understand? Essentially the same way our own brains\ninterpret emotions, by learning how to spot them. American psychologist Paul Ekman\nidentified certain universal emotions whose visual cues are understood\nthe same way across cultures. For example, an image of a smile\nsignals joy to modern urban dwellers and aboriginal tribesmen alike. And according to Ekman, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise are equally recognizable. As it turns out, computers are rapidly\ngetting better at image recognition thanks to machine learning algorithms,\nsuch as neural networks. These consist of artificial nodes that\nmimic our biological neurons by forming connections \nand exchanging information. To train the network, sample inputs\npre-classified into different categories, such as photos marked happy or sad, are fed into the system. The network then learns to classify\nthose samples by adjusting the relative weights\nassigned to particular features. The more training data it's given, the better the algorithm becomes\nat correctly identifying new images. This is similar to our own brains, which learn from previous experiences\nto shape how new stimuli are processed. Recognition algorithms aren't just\nlimited to facial expressions. Our emotions manifest in many ways. There's body language and vocal tone, changes in heart rate, complexion,\nand skin temperature, or even word frequency and sentence\nstructure in our writing. You might think that training\nneural networks to recognize these would be a long and complicated task until you realize just how much \ndata is out there, and how quickly modern computers\ncan process it. From social media posts, uploaded photos and videos, and phone recordings, to heat-sensitive security cameras and wearables that monitor\nphysiological signs, the big question is not how to collect\nenough data, but what we're going to do with it. There are plenty of beneficial uses\nfor computerized emotion recognition. Robots using algorithms to identify\nfacial expressions can help children learn or provide lonely people\nwith a sense of companionship. Social media companies are considering\nusing algorithms to help prevent suicides by flagging posts\nthat contain specific words or phrases. And emotion recognition software can help\ntreat mental disorders or even provide people with low-cost\nautomated psychotherapy. Despite the potential benefits, the prospect of a massive network\nautomatically scanning our photos, communications, and physiological signs\nis also quite disturbing. What are the implications for our privacy\nwhen such impersonal systems are used by corporations to exploit\nour emotions through advertising? And what becomes of our rights if authorities think they can identify\nthe people likely to commit crimes before they even make \na conscious decision to act? Robots currently have a long way to go in distinguishing emotional nuances,\nlike irony, and scales of emotions,\njust how happy or sad someone is. Nonetheless, they may eventually be able\nto accurately read our emotions and respond to them. Whether they can empathize with our fear\nof unwanted intrusion, however, that's another story."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the main point of Paul Ekman’s theory of universal emotions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "That people can feel only six emotions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "That the only way to show happiness is to smile"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That emotions are only manifested in the human face"}, {"label": "D", "text": "That when shown a photo of a person crying, people will recognize sadness, regardless of cultural and demographic background"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Emotion understanding is now easier for machines because of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "People tagging themselves and adding hashtags to social media posts"}, {"label": "B", "text": "People carrying mobile phones and using wearables almost all the time"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prices and size of processors, memory, and storage being at an all-time low"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In order to be trained successfully, neural networks require:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lots of pre-classified training data"}, {"label": "B", "text": "High-quality images"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Data from different cameras"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Data from microphones and wearables"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A major problem for self-driving cars would be:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To locate humans walking in front of them"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To verify the identity of the car driver"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To decide what to do in an unknown situation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To find its way in an unknown neighborhood"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Machines identifying emotions: this can be dangerous because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They can steal and use our credit card information"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They can recognize us in an outdoor setting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They can falsely predict our possible actions preemptively"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They can identify whether we are attracted to someone"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

There are three strategies, each one of them loses once and wins once So it looks like there's no strategy that you can play to win, but I'm going to show you about a new paper that had just come out where it gives you some top tips of how to win So it's a group of Chinese scientists, where they run an experiment where they got 360 students to play games of rock-paper-scissors with one another 300 rounds in every game, which took up to 2 hours, which is astonishing, students playing \nrock-paper-scissors for 2 hours Okay, so normally if you have rock-paper-scissors and some of you had rock (R) up there, and rock is beaten by paper (P), which is then beaten by scissors (S) So none of these strategies dominate the other, so really all you can do is play each strategy with an equal probability: 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, okay Now, if you were playing against a computer, who was choosing these perfectly randomly, then that would be the best thing for you to do -- just to pick each strategy with equal probability But the thing is, humans are quite predictably irrational, so to say, in the way they choose their strategy So, in recording what one of these students did in playing rock-paper-scissors the scientists came up with two quite important findings of how people try to beat each other Okay, so the first one is that people who win tend to repeat their strategy So, for example, if I beat you by playing rock, there is a very high chance, or high probability that I will play rock again the second time. If it worked once, it's going to work again, right? The second thing that they found out is that losers change BRADY: To anything in particular, or...?\nDR. FRY: Well, so this is a thing that you can exploit, essentially so if you know-- so this gives us, I suppose, two strategies that we can use So the first tip is that if you lose, that means the other person just won, right? So let's imagine that your opponent won by playing rock Now, the chances are that they're going to play rock again, you should then play paper so you just lost on scissors, so you should play paper which means that, basically, even though paper beats rock (so the cycle goes around like this: paper beats rock and so on) you should go the other way around the triangle Let's imagine that you played scissors, the other person played rock, what you should do is you should go backwards around this triangle and play paper the next time because of the high chance that they're going to play rock again So that's the first thing: Go backwards, I guess Or another way to say it is -- essentially, you've just played scissors, they've played rock so play the thing that didn't come up in that, if you lose Now the second thing, is that if you've just won now, they're going to expect you to play the same thing again, right? which means, that they're going to play the thing that you would beat the thing that you just played so you need to play the thing that would beat that would beat the thing that you just played which is equivalent to saying, you need to play what they just played you want to [laughs] let's go again [both laugh] BRADY: I like the easy way better, so you should play what they just played DR. FRY: You should play what they just played, yes So let's imagine, then, you just won -- you played rock, right? -- and you just won on rock that means that they played scissors, now they're going to think that you're going to play rock again, which means that they're going to play paper, which means that you should play scissors and so again, you basically end up going backwards around the triangle so play what they just played, and the game go backwards or an easier way to say it then is to play what they just played. So in general, if you're cycling through rock-paper-scissors, your best strategy is to go backwards and go scissors-paper-rock, and cycle through that way BRADY: How much-- Is this mathematics or is this psychology? This is-- I can't tell if this is all to do with probability, or it's just about knowing how humans think DR. FRY: Well, I think that a balance of the two, so it's rooted in game theory which is the mathematics of looking at decisions and strategies, so in any situation where you're competing against someone, and you best move is dependent on what the other person is playing, you can frame in game theory BRADY: Numberphile is brought to you by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute But this video has also been sponsored by Squarespace Squarespace is a great service for designing, hosting, creating your own websites and as probably mentioned before, I use it myself No matter what you want to do -- a blog, podcast, shop, portfolio, Squarespace is as easy as 1-2-3 But it's not just amateurs who benefit from Squarespace and all its brilliant templates, Their developer platform will also give you full control over all the code, letting you tweak the HTML, CSS and Javascript into your heart's content And if you like stats, and you're watching Numberphile, you'll really like watching Squarespace's analytics, their 3rd party integrations, and their easy-to-use commerce If you'd like to find out more, go to squarespace.com/numberphile you can try it all out, you can set up your own site, and you can do it all for free, no credit card required And then if you do like it, and decide to opt in, use the offer code NUMBERPHILE and you get 10% off So thank you very much to Squarespace for supporting this video and thank you to you for watching it"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "According to this strategy, if you lose your first hand to someone who played rock, what should you play in your second hand?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rock"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Paper"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Scissors"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to this strategy, if you win your first hand using rock, what should you play in your second hand?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rock"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Paper"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Scissors"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

You're in the middle of a quiet afternoon when suddenly a shipment of 1,280\ndifferent books arrives. The books have been dropped of\nin one long straight line, but they're all out of order, and the automatic sorting \nsystem is broken. To make matters worse,\nclasses start tomorrow, which means that \nfirst thing in the morning, students will show up in droves\nlooking for these books. How can you get them all sorted in time? One way would be to start at one end\nof the line with the first pair of books. If the first two books are in order,\nthen leave them as they are. Otherwise, swap them. Then, look at the second and third books, repeat the process, and continue until you reach \nthe end of the line. At some point, you'll come across\nthe book that should be last, and keep swapping it with every\nsubsequent book, moving it down the line until it\nreaches the end where it belongs. Then, start from the beginning\nand repeat the process to get the second to last book\nin its proper place, and keep going until all books are sorted. This approach is called Bubble Sort. It's simple but slow. You'd make 1,279 comparisons\nin the first round, then 1,278, and so on, adding up to 818,560 comparisons. If each took just one second,\nthe process would take over nine days. A second strategy would be to start\nby sorting just the first two books. Then, take the third book and compare it\nwith the book in the second spot. If it belongs before the second book,\nswap them, then compare it \nwith the book in the first spot, and swap again if needed. Now you've sorted the first three books. Keep adding one book at a time\nto the sorted sub-line, comparing and swapping the new book\nwith the one before it until it's correctly placed\namong the books sorted so far. This is called Insertion Sort. Unlike Bubble Sort, it usually doesn't\nrequire comparing every pair of books. On average, we'd expect to only need\nto compare each book to half of the books that came before it. In that case, the total \nnumber of comparisons would be 409,280, taking almost five days. You're still doing \nway too many comparisons. Here's a better idea. First, pick a random book. Call it the partition and compare it\nto every other book. Then, divide the line by placing all the books \nthat come before the partition on its left and all the ones that come after it\non its right. You've just saved loads of time by not having to compare \nany of the books on the left to any of the ones \non the right ever again. Now, looking only \nat the books on the left, you can again pick a random partition book and separate those books that come\nbefore it from those that come after it. You can keep creating \nsub-partitions like this until you have a bunch of small sub-lines, each of which you'd sort quickly using\nanother strategy, like Insertion Sort. Each round of partitioning requires\nabout 1,280 comparisons. If your partitions are pretty balanced, dividing the books into 128 sub-lines of ten\nwould take about seven rounds, or 8,960 seconds. Sorting these sub-lines would add\nabout 22 seconds each. All in all, this method \nknown as QuickSort could sort the books \nin under three and a half hours. But there's a catch. Your partitions could end up lopsided,\nsaving no time at all. Luckily, this rarely happens. That's why QuickSort is one of the most\nefficient strategies used by programmers today. They use it for things like sorting items\nin an online store by price, or creating a list of all the gas stations\nclose to a given location sorted by distance. In your case, you're done quick sorting\nwith time to spare.

{"page": 35, "lesson": 9, "title": "The secrets of Mozart’s “Magic Flute” - Joshua Borths", "category": "Critical Thinking", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-secrets-of-mozart-s-magic-flute-joshua-borths", "transcript": {"en": "A boy named Prince Tamino\nruns through a dark wood pursued by a dragon. Just as it rears up to devour him, three mysterious ladies appear and slay the dragon \nwith their fierce battle cry. So begins Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's\n\"Die Zauberflöte,\" or \"The Magic Flute.\" This fantasy singspiel, a type of folk opera with music\nand dialogue, premiered in 1791 in Vienna. Though it may seem \nlike a childish fairytale, this intricate opera is full of\nsubversive symbolism, and it's now regarded as one of the most\ninfluential operas in history. Tamino's run in with the dragon\nis only the start of his journey. The three women summon their leader,\nthe Queen of the Night. She, in turn, sends Tamino on a quest\nto rescue her daughter Pamina from the evil sorcerer, Sarastro. And to help him on his journey,\nshe gives him the titular magic flute. Tamino eventually finds Pamina\nat Sarastro's temple, but behind enemy lines, Tamino and Pamina learn \nthat they're on the wrong side. The Queen of Night actually wants\nto plunge the world into darkness. Everything Tamino thought he knew\nwas wrong, filling him with doubt and confusion. So, a new quest begins for Tamino\nand Pamina. They must pass three trials of wisdom, and only then can the day \nvanquish the night. Helped by the flute's magic power, the two youths overcome these trials\nand the Queen's attempts to sabotage them. They're finally initiated into the temple\nhaving restored balance to the kingdom. Many elements in this peculiar fairytale were inspired by Mozart's involvement \nin Freemasonry, a network of fraternal organizations\nthroughout Europe. Much of their history, symbolism,\nand ritual came from the Middle Ages. But the Freemasons of Mozart's time were also influenced \nby 18th century European ideals - rationalism, humanism, and skepticism\ntowards traditional authorities, like monarchy and the church. The symbols of Freemasonry \nand these ideals of the Enlightenment are found throughout the opera. If this sounds like a conspiracy theory,\nthat's because it sort of was at the time, but it's now taken quite seriously and has been the subject of considerable\nscholarly publication. For example, some Mozart scholars\nbelieve the Queen of the Night symbolizes Maria Theresa,\nthe Empress of the Holy Roman Empire who opposed Freemasonry\nand banned it in Austria. While there continues to be debate\nas to the specific meaning, interpretation, and location of these masonic references, scholars agree that they're there\nand are fully intentional. One of these symbols is the number three, which represented balance and order\nto Freemasons. Now the number three is, of course,\neasy to find in any work of storytelling, but it's particularly prominent\nin \"The Magic Flute\": three trials, three ladies, three spirits, and three doors, much of the music \nis written in E-flat major, which has three flats \nin its key signature, and historically, masonic rituals\nbegan with three knocks. The opera references them by opening\nwith three majestic chords complete with dramatic pauses. Those chords, which reoccur \nthroughout the opera, serve another purpose. They capture the dramatic \narc of the opera in miniature. The first chord, E-flat major,\nis in its most natural root position, simple and unadorned. It echoes the child-like Prince Tamino, who, in his naiveté, accepts everything\nthe Queen and her ladies say without question. The second chord is C minor, a sour sonority that mirrors Tamino's \nsadness and doubt in the middle of the opera. That's when his world and notions of\ngood and evil get turned on their heads. And good and evil are just two of the\nopera's extreme opposites. It features some of the highest\nand lowest notes in opera, day and night, simple hummable melodies\nand complicated forward-looking music. The opera's central theme concerns\nbalancing these extremes to achieve perfect harmony. To reflect this, the final chord in the opening\nrestores musical order. It returns to the triumphant E-flat major, the same chord it started with\nbut inverted, meaning Mozart moved the bottom note\nto the top.

{"page": 35, "lesson": 11, "title": "Who was Voltaire?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/8degD1jK", "transcript": {"en": "François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris in 1694 His father, a well-established lawyer, sent him to the best school in the capital, and by all accounts, he was a brilliant student. The young Arouet, decided at an early age to make his name as a writer, or rather to remake his name, as the first thing he did was to change his name to Voltaire. The 18th century is often referred to as the Age of Reason, or the Age of Enlightenment, but sometimes more fairly simply as the Age of Voltaire. So, changing his name was a good call. The age of Arouet, which is not of work quite as well. Voltaire was precociously talented as a poet. At the age of only 24, he had his first verse tragedy performed at the Comédie-Française. By then, he'd already begun work on an epic poem about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, by pragmatically converting from Protestantism to Catholicism. This was to be a subject dear to Voltaire's heart, For under the guise of writing a national epic, he was dwelling at length on the bloody consequences of religious intolerance. Right from the start, Voltaire's views on religion were expressed robustly. He was not an atheist. In part, because he thought that some minimal belief in a deity was useful for social cohesion. Voltaire's God had created the world, instilled in us a sense of good and evil and then basically taken a back seat. This was known as rational religion, Or in the 18th century called natural religion, or deism. And it had no truck with metaphysics of any kind. Voltaire was basically a man of reason, who loathed fanaticism, idolatry and superstition. That men can kill each other to defend some bit of religious doctrine, which they scarcely understand, is something he found repellent. And he reserved his greatest hatred for the clerics, who exploited the credulity of believers to maintain their own power base. Voltaire wanted religion but not the Church. For obvious reasons, the Catholic authorities were not keen for Voltaire's poem about Henry IV, La Henriade, to be published in France. So Voltaire decided to go and publish it in London instead, and in 1726, went and traveled to England. What began as a business trip soon turned, however, into something quite different. And Voltaire ended up staying in England for some two and a half years. He learned to speak English fluently, got to know writers and politicians, and became a great admirer of English Protestant culture. He decided to write a book about his experience of England. And the Letters Concerning the English Nation appeared first in English in 1733. The French authorities were horrified. The book was censored and Voltaire only narrowly avoided prison. That's because the book presented an informal portrait of English culture, In a witty and ironical style looking in turn at religion, politics, science and literature, in ways that were critical implicitly of French culture and politics. Here, for example, is how Voltaire presents the Royal Exchange, a handsome building in the heart of the City of London, where merchants from across the world would meet to transact business. \"Take a view of the Royal Exchange,\" Voltaire wrote, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Muhammadan and a Christian transact together as though they all profess the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but the bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker’s word. At the breaking up of this pacific and free assembly, some will withdraw to the synagogue, and others to take a glass. This man goes and is baptised in a great tub, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: that man has his son’s foreskin cut off, whilst a set of Hebrew words (quite unintelligible to him) are mumbled over his child. If one religion only were allowed in England, the government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there as such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace.\" Voltaire's message is clear. Religious differences are trivial and separate men, while trade is important and brings them together. His conclusion, that the plurality of religions in England leads to a more peaceful society, is, of course, a covert criticism of France, where the Catholic Church was so dominant. The Letters Concerning the English Nation, also discuss Locke and Newton, thinkers then poorly known in France The subject-matter might seem challenging, but Voltaire is a past master popularising difficult material. Ask any schoolchild today what they know about Newton, and they'll tell you about the apple falling on his head, and the survival of this anecdote is due entirely to Voltaire. He heard it from Newton's niece and immediately understood that this simple homely image was the perfect way of conveying the simplicity of Newton's explanation of the force of gravity. After Voltaire used the story in his Letters Concerning the English Nation, everyone remembered it and Voltaire left his mark on English popular culture. Voltaire struggled with the question of good and evil the problem at the heart of his best-known work, Candide which was published in 1759 and was a best seller from the moment it appeared. Translated into every possible language, it remains the most widely read work of the European Enlightenment. It's even left its mark on our language Expressions like 'pour encourager les autres' to encourage the others or 'il faut cultiver le jardin', we must cultivate our garden have entered common usage. 'In the best of all possible worlds', yes, that's another one speakers of French or English quote Candide, without even realising it. And that's the sure mark of a classic. Candide is a timeless work, as satire of the human condition, but it's also work of the Enlightenment and its philosophical theme is announced in the title: \"Candide\" or \"Optimism\". The hero of Candide, as his name tells us, is an innocent anti-hero. He is in thrall to his tutor, Pangloss, who preaches the philosophy of Optimism. This is not 'optimism' in the modern sense of looking on the bright side. Optimism, spelled with a capital O and as expounded by the German philosopher, Leibniz, was an attempt to answer the age-old problem of evil. Why, if God is good, does he permit the existence of evil in the world? To which the 18th century Leibnizian Optimist replies, evil is all part of some greater pattern of good: 'All partial evil, universal good' as the English poet \"Pope\" put it. In other words, evil doesn't really exist at all. It's just something which man imagines because of his limited view of the world. You might think this sounds like a bit of a confidence trick, Voltaire certainly did, but this idea did find widespread acceptance in the 18th century. Candide's great mission was to put this philosophy to the test. Ejected from his comfortable home in an obscure German castle, after trying to seduce the Baron's beautiful daughter, Cunégonde, Voltaire's hero, Candide, undergoes many trials and tribulations: conscripted into the army, he fights in a war, then deserts, only to find himself a witness to an earthquake in Lisbon. Candide is repeatedly brought face to face with evil in its most extreme forms: moral evil, in the case of the earthquake, where man is not apparently to blame; and most of all human evil, such as the war, where man is very definitely to blame. Pangloss's breezy Optimism is clearly an inadequate response to enormities of evil on this scale. Eventually, even Candide comes to realize this: to quote from the book, 'And sometimes Pangloss would say to Candide:                   After 1760, Voltaire took up residence in the château at Ferney, just outside Geneva. By now, he was the most famous living writer in Europe, and he became widely known as the ‘patriarch of Ferney’. He took up a number of public causes. In 1761, a Protestant merchant Jean Calas, was accused of murdering his son and sentenced by the judges of Toulouse to be tortured and then broken on the wheel. The legal processes were, to say the least, irregular, and the suspicions grew that the judges in his Catholic city had acted with excessive zeal out of religious bigotry. Voltaire became involved in the case and mounted an energetic campaign to rehabilitate Calas’ memory and help the members of his family, who had been left destitute. He wrote letters to those in authority and published a stream of pamphlets, culminating in 1763 in his Traité sur la tolérance, which begins with the historical facts of the Calas case and broadens out into a history of religious intolerance in European culture. Voltaire's writings had enormous impact on public opinion, and eventually the judges in Paris quashed the judgment of the Toulouse court. Too late to save Calas, but a huge victory for Voltaire, who had learnt an important lesson about how change could be brought about through the pressure of public opinion.     Voltaire said of himself that he ‘wrote to act’, and he wanted his writings to change the way people thought and behaved. In leading his crusades against fanaticism, he even invented a campaign slogan, Ecrasez l’Infâme!, which translates roughly as ‘Crush the despicable!’. L’Infâme stands here for everything that Voltaire hates, everything that he had spent his life fighting: superstition, intolerance, irrational behaviour of every kind. We should never forget that Voltaire was also a brilliant writer, one of the greatest stylist the French language has ever known. The power of his ideas had a lot to do with the power of his expression. Many writers made fun of miracles. No one did so hilariously as Voltaire. Always, Voltaire had an ear for the telling phrase:   It's a good line, even in English, and better still in the original French where it is more memorable because it is a classical alexandrine line in 12 syllables: Si Dieu n’existait pas, il faudrait l’inventer. Voltaire's legacy in our present debates about religious toleration remain extremely potent. Hardly a week passes without an article in the press quoting: ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’ This rallying cry of tolerant multiculturalism is so potent that if Voltaire hadn't said it, we would have had to invent it, which is what happened. The expression was invented by an English woman in 1906. No matter, it expresses a truth which is fundamentally important to our culture, so we have adopted the phrase and decided that Voltaire said it. Voltaire, his name has become synonymous with a set of liberal values: freedom of speech, rejection of bigotry and superstition, belief in reason and tolerance. It's a unique, and nowadays, extremely precious legacy."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was Voltaire's name before he changed it?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Candide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cacambo"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Arouet"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "True / False: Voltaire was an atheist.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the most widely read book of the European Enlightenment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Social Contract"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Candide"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Wealth of Nations"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of these popular phrases came from Candide?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "We must cultivate our garden"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the best of all possible worlds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A & B"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 35, "lesson": 12, "title": "This temporary tattoo helps women have healthy pregnancies", "category": "Civics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/vnkW58Oi", "transcript": {"en": "Please meet Jane. She has a high-risk pregnancy. Within 24 weeks, she's on bed rest at the hospital, being monitored\nfor her preterm contractions. She doesn't look the happiest. That's in part because it requires\ntechnicians and experts to apply these clunky belts on her\nto monitor her uterine contractions. Another reason Jane is not so happy\nis because she's worried. In particular, she's worried\nabout what happens after her 10-day stay\non bed rest at the hospital. What happens when she's home? If she were to give birth this early\nit would be devastating. As an African-American woman, she's twice as likely\nto have a premature birth or to have a stillbirth. So Jane basically has one of two options: stay at the hospital on bed rest, a prisoner to the technology\nuntil she gives birth, and then spend the rest\nof her life paying for the bill; or head home after her 10-day stay\nand hope for the best. Neither of these two options\nseems appealing. As I began to think\nabout stories like this and hear about stories like this, I began to ask myself and imagine: Is there an alternative? Is there a way we could have\nthe benefits of high-fidelity monitoring that we get with our trusted\npartners in the hospital while someone is at home\nliving their daily life? With that in mind, I encouraged people in my research group to partner with some\nclever material scientists, and all of us came together\nand brainstormed. And after a long process, we came up with a vision, an idea, of a wearable system that perhaps\nyou could wear like a piece of jewelry or you could apply\nto yourself like a Band-Aid. And after many trials and tribulations\nand years of endeavors, we were able to come up\nwith this flexible electronic patch that was manufactured\nusing the same processes that they use to build computer chips, except the electronics are transferred\nfrom a semiconductor wafer onto a flexible material\nthat can interface with the human body. These systems are about\nthe thickness of a human hair. They can measure the types\nof information that we want, things such as: bodily movement, bodily temperature, electrical rhythms of the body and so forth. We can also engineer these systems, so they can integrate energy sources, and can have wireless\ntransmission capabilities. So as we began to build\nthese types of systems, we began to test them on ourselves\nin our research group. But in addition, we began to reach out\nto some of our clinical partners in San Diego, and test these on different patients\nin different clinical conditions, including moms-to-be like Jane. Here is a picture of a pregnant woman\nin labor at our university hospital being monitored for her uterine\ncontractions with the conventional belt. In addition, our flexible electronic patches are there. This picture demonstrates waveforms\npertaining to the fetal heart rate, where the red corresponds\nto what was acquired with the conventional belts, and the blue corresponds to our estimates using our flexible electronic systems\nand our algorithms. At this moment, we gave ourselves a big mental high five. Some of the things we had imagined\nwere beginning to come to fruition, and we were actually seeing this\nin a clinical context. But there was still a problem. The problem was, the way\nwe manufactured these systems was very inefficient, had low yield and was very error-prone. In addition, as we talked to some\nof the nurses in the hospital, they encouraged us to make sure that our electronics worked\nwith typical medical adhesives that are used in a hospital. We had an epiphany and said,\n\"Wait a minute. Rather than just making\nthem work with adhesives, let's integrate them into adhesives, and that could solve\nour manufacturing problem.\" This picture that you see here is our ability to embed these censors\ninside of a piece of Scotch tape by simply peeling it off of a wafer. Ongoing work in our research group\nallows us to, in addition, embed integrated circuits\ninto the flexible adhesives to do things like amplifying signals\nand digitizing them, processing them and encoding for wireless transmission. All of this integrated\ninto the same medical adhesives that are used in the hospital. So when we reached this point, we had some other challenges, from both an engineering\nas well as a usability perspective, to make sure that we could\nmake it used practically. In many digital health discussions, people believe in and embrace the idea\nthat we can simply digitize the data, wirelessly transmit it, send it to the cloud, and in the cloud, we can extract meaningful\ninformation for interpretation. And indeed, you can do all of that, if you're not worried\nabout some of the energy challenges. Think about Jane for a moment. She doesn't live in Palo Alto, nor does she live in Beverly Hills. What that means is, we have to be mindful about her data plan\nand how much it would cost for her to be sending out\na continuous stream of data. There's another challenge that not everyone in the medical\nprofession is comfortable talking about. And that is, that Jane\ndoes not have the most trust in the medical establishment. She, people like her, her ancestors,\nhave not had the best experiences at the hands of doctors and the hospital or insurance companies. That means that we have to be mindful\nof questions of privacy. Jane might not feel that happy about all that data\nbeing processed into the cloud. And Jane cannot be fooled; she reads the news. She knows that if the federal\ngovernment can be hacked, if the Fortune 500 can be hacked, so can her doctor. And so with that in mind, we had an epiphany. We cannot outsmart\nall the hackers in the world, but perhaps we can present\nthem a smaller target. What if we could actually, rather than have those algorithms\nthat do data interpretation run in the cloud, what if we have those algorithms run\non those small integrated circuits embedded into those adhesives? And so when we integrate\nthese things together, what this means is that now\nwe can think about the future where someone like Jane can still\ngo about living her normal daily life, she can be monitored, it can be done in a way where\nshe doesn't have to get another job to pay her data plan, and we can also address\nsome of her concerns about privacy. So at this point, we're feeling very good about ourselves. We've accomplished this, we've begun to address some\nof these questions about privacy and we feel like, pretty much\nthe chapter is closed now. Everyone lived happily ever after, right? Well, not so fast. (Laughter) One of the things we have to remember,\nas I mentioned earlier, is that Jane does not have the most trust\nin the medical establishment. We have to remember that there are increasing\nand widening health disparities, and there's inequity in terms\nof proper care management. And so what that means\nis that this simple picture of Jane and her data -- even with her being comfortable\nbeing wirelessly transmitted to the cloud, letting a doctor intervene if necessary -- is not the whole story. So what we're beginning to do is to think about ways to have\ntrusted parties serve as intermediaries between people like Jane\nand her health care providers. For example, we've begun\nto partner with churches and to think about nurses\nthat are church members, that come from that trusted community, as patient advocates and health coaches\nto people like Jane. Another thing we have going for us is that insurance companies, increasingly, are attracted to some of these ideas. They're increasingly realizing that perhaps it's better\nto pay one dollar now for a wearable device and a health coach, rather than paying 10 dollars later, when that baby is born prematurely and ends up in the neonatal\nintensive care unit -- one of the most expensive\nparts of a hospital. This has been a long\nlearning process for us. This iterative process of breaking\nthrough and attacking one problem and not feeling totally comfortable, and identifying the next problem, has helped us go along this path of actually trying to not only\ninnovate with this technology but make sure it can be used for people\nwho perhaps need it the most. Another learning lesson\nwe've taken from this process that is very humbling, is that as technology progresses\nand advances at an accelerating rate, we have to remember that human beings\nare using this technology, and we have to be mindful that these human beings --\nthey have a face, they have a name and a life. And in the case of Jane, hopefully, two. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

And there's only one way to be hired: get appointed to the US Supreme Court. If you want to become \na justice on the Supreme Court, the highest federal court \nin the United States, three things have to happen. You have to be nominated by\nthe president of the United States, your nomination needs to be\napproved by the Senate, and finally, the president must\nformally appoint you to the court. Because the Constitution doesn't specify\nany qualifications, in other words, that there's no age,\neducation, profession, or even native-born \ncitizenship requirement, a president can nominate any individual\nto serve. So far, six justices \nhave been foreign-born, at least one never graduated\nfrom high school, and another was only 32 years old\nwhen he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals\nwho broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint \nliberals to the court. Of course, a justice's leanings\nare not always so predictable. For example, when President Eisenhower,\na Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him\nto make conservative decisions. Instead, Warren's judgements have gone\ndown as some of the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later remarked on that\nappointment as \"the biggest damned-fool mistake\" \nhe ever made. Many other factors come up\nfor consideration, as well, including experience, personal loyalties,\nethnicity, and gender. The candidates are then thoroughly vetted down to their tax records\nand payments to domestic help. Once the president interviews \nthe candidate and makes a formal nomination\nannouncement, the Senate leadership traditionally\nturns the nomination over to hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Depending on the contentiousness\nof the choice, that can stretch over many days. Since the Nixon administration,\nthese hearings have averaged 60 days. The nominee is interviewed \nabout their law record, if applicable, and where they stand on key issues\nto discern how they might vote. And especially in more recent history, the committee tries to unearth\nany dark secrets or past indiscretions. The Judiciary Committee votes to send\nthe nomination to the full Senate with a positive \nor negative recommendation, often reflective of political leanings,\nor no recommendation at all. Most rejections have happened\nwhen the Senate majority has been a different political \nparty than the president. When the Senate does approve,\nit's by a simple majority vote, with ties broken by the vice president. With the Senate's consent, the president issues \na written appointment, allowing the nominee to complete\nthe final steps to take the constitutional \nand judicial oaths. In doing so, they solemnly swear to administer \njustice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor\nand the rich and faithfully and impartially discharge\nand perform all the duties incumbent upon a US Supreme Court justice. This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement,\nor removal from the court by impeachment. And of the 112 justices who have held\nthe position, not one has yet been removed from\noffice as a result of an impeachment. One of their roles is to protect\nthe fundamental rights of all Americans, even as different parties take power. With the tremendous impact\nof this responsibility, it's no wonder that a US Supreme \nCourt justice is expected to be, in the words of Irving R.

{"page": 35, "lesson": 15, "title": "Why salt & pepper?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/MmcBZPTg", "transcript": {"en": "[Music] They've sat with us at nearly every\ntable, a pair that's partnered most of the meals ever cooked in western\nkitchens. A Yin and Yang, darkness and light. The importance of salt is crystal\nclear. Life wouldn't exist without it and if it\ndid it would taste gross and weird. But out of all the herbs and spices on the\nculinary roster how did this ground up gray stuff become\nthe go-to spice of life. Seriously, why not salt and turmeric or\nsalt and mustard, salt and cumin, salt and nutmeg, salt and coriander, salt and paprika, salt and cinnamon, salt and allspice, salt and cloves. [Music] Salt, or specifically sodium\nchloride. It's the only rock that we eat, the\nunlikely joining of a poisonous gas and an explosive-metal and when paired with\nwater it provides both the incubator and ingredients for life. We use sodium and chloride ions to keep\nour cells inflated, to regulate blood pressure and convey electrical nerve\nimpulses throughout our body. To maintain this we need to consume about six grams\nof sodium chloride every day. So salt's culinary and cultural value is no\nsurprise its history could fill a book, and it has.\nA great book by the way. Have you guys read the book Salt: A World History Early hunter-gatherer societies got\nall the salt needed from their animal diet To this day the Masai people of East\nAfrica get theirs from drinking the blood of their livestock. But as human\nsociety is shifted to growing and eating plants, salt became something you either\nfound or traded for. The earliest sites of salt harvesting date to at least\n6,000 BC in China and Europe There's salt in most of the blue wet\nstuff covering earth once you boil away or evaporate all that pesky H2O but there's pure sodium chloride in\nEarth's crust, if you can find it. Following animal\ntrails led us to natural salt licks and some of these became our first highways.\nSeveral ancient salt harvesting cities still bear a pinch of history in their\nname. Entire economies were built around salt. It was a commodity and currency\nthat you could eat. Roman warriors deemed worth their salt\nwhere sometimes given a salary. The Roman custom of salting bitter\ngreens even gave us salad. Although that caesar dressing comes from Tijuana. Today salt is cheap enough to manufacture that many people are in\ndanger of eating too much. But before the Industrial Age it was scarce enough that\npeople fought wars over it. It even inspired at least one revolution. Before refrigeration, salting was one way\nto keep food from spoiling. Since most harmful bacteria can't grow\nin high salt conditions. But obviously salt also changes how we experience our\nfood. It makes things taste salty but it also accentuates other flavors. Sodium\nchloride can chemically block bitter taste receptors and amplify those that\nsense sweet, salty, and umami. Depending on when and how its applied to food it can change the very chemistry of how it's\ncooked. Salt is probably the most important\ningredient on Earth. But then there's pepper. One spice to rule them all. If you thought salt was interesting,\npepper is is a thing. Black pepper comes from a flowering vine\nnative to Southeast Asia. It gets its heat from a chemical called\npiperine. Rather than capsaicin like those confusingly named fruits of the\nchili pepper family. It's been a common ingredient in Indian\ncooking for at least four thousand years. But small amounts of black pepper made\ntheir way to Greece, Rome, and even ancient Egypt, where peppercorns were\napparently valuable enough to stuff up the mummified nose of Ramses the second. Pepper became a key commodity in the\nspice trade stretching between Asia and Europe, where its main use like other\npungent spices was to mask the flavor of meat that was, shall we say, past its\nprime. The extreme distances involved in\ntrading pepper across the known world translated into extreme prices. To\ninflate them further Arab traders invented a myth that pepper gardens were\nguarded by serpents which had to be chased away with fire before a harvest. \nWho wouldn't want to put magic snake powder on their food. Throughout the\nMiddle Ages it was common to see many spices used in the food of the wealthy,\nbut the enduring popularity of black pepper may owe itself to one picky eater. Its said that Louis XIV\ndemanded his food lightly seasoned, preferring only salt and pepper be added.\nThe French cuisine developed then was the basis for much of what we eat today, and now pepper is the spice and I'm sick\nof it. Too long we've been forced to look at the world of spice in black and white!\nHeld prisoner by pepper, unable to gaze upon the full rainbow of flavors and I\nsay no more! Join me, brothers and sisters, stand\ntogether. We say yes to salt. But let us say anything but pepper!

An average dog’s nose is anywhere between ten thousand to one hundred thousand times more sensitive that yours. So how can dogs with their super sense of smell be so interested in their K9 compatriot’s rear ends? Well folks, the answer is more complex and interesting thank you think. When a dog smells another dog’s butt, it’s actually collecting a bunch of information about the other dog – its diet, its gender, its emotional state and so on. Think of it kind of like speaking with chemicals. In fact, this butt-sniffing action is just one of many examples of chemical communication in the animal kingdom. But what chemicals are packed in a fido’s rear end and where do they come from? We talked to Dr. George Preti of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. Dr. Preti currently studies the complexity of human body odors and pheromones. But back in 1975, he was on the cutting edge of dog butts science. He and his team of researchers examined the anal secretions of dogs and wild coyotes. So on both sides of Sparky’s back door is a stinky, small pouch called an anal sac. This sac houses glands that excrete the chemicals dogs use to get to know each other. The apocrine gland is most responsible for that “dog smell”, but the sebaceous glands also play a part. Petri discovered the primary chemical compounds that produce a dog’s aroma are trimethylamine and a host of short chain acids. As you might expect, anal sac secretions have a very powerful, sharp odor as a result of the acids inside. But a dog’s genetics, diet, and the current state of their immune system can all influence this aroma through chemical changes in the secretions. You’d think the smell of dog poop would overpower Rover’s sensitive snout. But dogs have a second olfactory system in their hyper-sensitive nose called the Jacobson’s organ. The organ is designed specifically for chemical  communication. It has its own set of nerves that lead directly to the brain, so there’s absolutely no interference from other odors. The same organ is used when a dog sniffs a fire hydrant, or anywhere else there happens to be dog pee. So, there you have it folks. Your precious pet isn’t obsessed with other dog’s butts per say. They’re just getting to know each other in a professional aromatic way. Hey speaking of aroma, you should check out this video on why bacon smells so good, because bacon is to people, as butts are to dogs.

Eileen is only 13 years old, but when we were going through\nthe collection of poetry that we wrote, I found her poem so interesting, so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She entitled her poem\n\"I'll Marry When I Want.\" (Laughter) \"I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to marry. My uncle, my aunt, my brother or sister, cannot force me to marry. No one in the world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me, even if you chase me away, even if you do anything bad to me, I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I want, but not before I am well educated, and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when I want.\" This poem might seem odd, written by a 13-year-old girl, but where I and Eileen come from, this poem, which I have just read to you, is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country, I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls, two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes, they would share clothes, and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently, in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her, even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture, once you reach puberty stage, you are supposed to go\nto initiation camps. In these initiation camps, you are taught how\nto sexually please a man. There is this special day, which they call \"Very Special Day\" where a man who is hired\nby the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister,\nshe ended up being pregnant. Today, she's only 16 years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive, nor did her second marriage. On the other side, there is this girl. She's amazing. (Laughter) (Applause) I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me. (Laughter) When I was 13 years old, I was told, you are grown up, you have now reached of age, you're supposed to go\nto the initiation camp. I was like, \"What? I'm not going to go\nto the initiation camps.\" You know what the women said to me? \"You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions\nof our society, of our community.\" I said no because I knew\nwhere I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer, seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day, I would contribute something,\na little something to my community. But every day after refusing, women would tell me, \"Look at you, you're all grown up.\nYour little sister has a baby. What about you?\" That was the music\nthat I was hearing every day, and that is the music\nthat girls hear every day when they don't do something\nthat the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories\nbetween me and my sister, I said, \"Why can't I do something? Why can't I change something\nthat has happened for a long time in our community?\" That was when I called other girls just like my sister, who have children, who have been in class but they have\nforgotten how to read and write. I said, \"Come on, we can \nremind each other how to read and write again, how to hold the pen,\nhow to read, to hold the book.\" It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able to tell me\ntheir personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like, 'Why can't we take all these things\nthat are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers,\nour traditional leaders, that these are the wrong things?\" It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change, but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard, but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us\nand said no girl has to be married before the age of 18. (Applause) In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls\nnot just in my community, but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill\nwas being presented in February, we were there at the Parliament house. Every day, when the members\nof Parliament were entering, we were telling them,\n\"Would you please support the bill?\" And we don't have\nmuch technology like here, but we have our small phones. So we said, \"Why can't we get \ntheir numbers and text them?\" So we did that. It was a good thing. (Applause) So when the bill passed,\nwe texted them back, \"Thank you for supporting the bill.\" (Laughter) And when the bill was signed\nby the president, making it into law, it was a plus. Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal\nmarriage age, from 15 to 18. (Applause) It's a good thing to know\nthat the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are countries where 18\nis the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries\nof women and girls every day? Every day, girls' lives\nare being wasted away. This is high time for leaders\nto honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues\nat heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women,\nas we are in this room, we are not just women,\nwe are not just girls, we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law\nuntil it is enforced? The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries\nhave been there, they need to be publicized\nat the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues, difficult issues,\nat the community level every day. So if these young girls know\nthat there are laws that protect them, they will be able to stand up\nand defend themselves because they will know that\nthere is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful, they are there, but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need: good education, and above all,\nnot to marry whilst 11. And furthermore, I know that together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can\nend child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl,\nand millions of girls worldwide, will be able to say, \"I will marry when I want.\" (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What country is Memory from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Malawi"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Zambia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tanzania"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How old was Memory’s sister when she got pregnant?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "11"}, {"label": "B", "text": "13"}, {"label": "C", "text": "15"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many children did Memory’s sister have by age 16?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Memory helped her community put a rule in place that no girl could be forced to be married before what age?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15"}, {"label": "B", "text": "16"}, {"label": "C", "text": "18"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What country is Memory from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Malawi"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Zambia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tanzania"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How old was Memory’s sister when she got pregnant?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "11"}, {"label": "B", "text": "13"}, {"label": "C", "text": "15"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many children did Memory’s sister have by age 16?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Memory helped her community put a rule in place that no girl could be forced to be married before what age?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15"}, {"label": "B", "text": "16"}, {"label": "C", "text": "18"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

To escape the inferno, they must cross over to the left bank\nof a crocodile-infested river. Fortunately, there happens\nto be a raft nearby. It can carry up to two animals at a time, and needs as least one lion\nor wildebeest on board to row it across the river. There's just one problem. If the lions ever outnumber the\nwildebeest on either side of the river, even for a moment, their instincts will kick in,\nand the results won't be pretty. That includes the animals in the boat\nwhen it's on a given side of the river. What's the fastest way for all six animals\nto get across without the lions stopping for dinner? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you feel stuck on a problem like this, try listing all the decisions you can make\nat each point, and the consequences each choice\nleads to. For instance, there are five options\nfor who goes across first: one wildebeest, one lion, two wildebeest, two lions, or one of each. If one animal goes alone, it'll just have to come straight back. And if two wildebeest cross first, the remaining one will immediately\nget eaten. So those options are all out. Sending two lions, or one of each animal, can actually both lead to solutions\nin the same number of moves. For the sake of time,\nwe'll focus on the second one. One of each animal crosses. Now, if the wildebeest stays \nand the lion returns, there will be three lions\non the right bank. Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest. So we need to have the lion\nstay on the left bank and the wildebeest go back to the right. Now we have the same five options, but with one lion \nalready on the left bank. If two wildebeest go,\nthe one that stays will get eaten, and if one of each animal goes, the wildebeest on the raft\nwill be outnumbered as soon as it reaches the other side. So that's a dead end, which means that at the third crossing, only the two lions can go. One gets dropped off, leaving two lions on the left bank. The third lion takes the raft back to\nthe right bank where the wildebeest are waiting. What now? Well, since we've got two lions waiting\non the left bank, the only option is for two wildebeest\nto cross. Next, there's no sense in two wildebeest\ngoing back, since that just reverses the last step. And if two lions go back, they'll outnumber the wildebeest\non the right bank. So one lion and one wildebeest\ntake the raft back leaving us with one of each animal\non the left bank and two of each on the right. Again, there's no point in sending \nthe lion-wildebeest pair back, so the next trip should be either\na pair of lions or a pair of wildebeest. If the lions go, they'd eat the wildebeest\non the left, so they stay, and the two wildebeest cross instead. Now we're quite close because the\nwildebeest are all where they need to be with safety in numbers. All that's left is for that one lion\nto raft back and bring his fellow lions over\none by one. That makes eleven trips total, the smallest number needed\nto get everyone across safely. The solution that involves sending both\nlions on the first step works similarly, and also takes eleven crossings. The six animals escape unharmed\nfrom the fire just in time and begin their new lives \nacross the river. Of course, now that the danger's passed, it remains to be seen how long their\nunlikely alliance will last."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why can’t the first move be two wildebeest going across?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The third wildebeest that doesn’t go will get eaten by the three lions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The crocodile might eat them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The wildebeest might not get along"}, {"label": "D", "text": "One animal going across is the most efficient move"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why can’t the first move be two wildebeest going across?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The third wildebeest that doesn’t go will get eaten by the three lions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The crocodile might eat them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The wildebeest might not get along"}, {"label": "D", "text": "One animal going across is the most efficient move"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which animal(s) can go across first (for the first crossing) to make the most efficient number of moves?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Two wildebeest"}, {"label": "B", "text": "One lion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "One lion and one wildebeest"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All six squeeze on the raft"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Assuming the correct scenario in question 2, what animal gets dropped off on the left side of the river?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The wildebeest"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The lion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They both stay"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They both go back"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "After the wildebeest rafts back (second crossing), which animal(s) now raft from the right side of the river to the left side (third crossing)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "One wildebeest"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Two wildebeest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Two lions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "One lion"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "After two lions are on the left, the third lion rafts back (fourth crossing).

{"page": 35, "lesson": 19, "title": "How you could get away with murder in Yellowstone’s “Zone of Death\"", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/AktiL4cY", "transcript": {"en": "This is a map of Yellowstone National Park. For the most part the park is in Wyoming, but it extends a bit into Montana and Idaho. This little 50 square miles section in Idaho is what concerns us. It's called the zone of death, because of a loophole that exists in the Constitution of the United States. If someone were to exploit that loophole they might be able to get away with murder. Yellowstone was established in 1872 before Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana joined the Union. It's federal land and always has been, but federal land across the U.S. is split up and divided into its corresponding state district courts. Except for Yellowstone. And this is where the loophole begins. Law professor Brian C. Kalt points out in his 2005 paper, \"The Perfect Crime\", that Yellowstone National Park was assigned fully to Wyoming's district court, even though small portions fall into Montana and Idaho. \"Unlike every other district, the district of Wyoming includes land in other states.\" So Kalt asks the question: what happens if you're caught for a crime you committed in that 50 square mile Idaho region of the park? The first thing law enforcement would do is bring you to Cheyenne, the hub of the district court of Wyoming, because the crime technically happened within Wyoming's jurisdiction. But Article 3 Section 2 of the United States Constitution says that the trial should happen in the state where you committed the crime. If you're a savvy murderer you'll invoke your right to a trial in Idaho. So they bring you back to Idaho no big deal. \"In the sixth amendment they said that they would require local juries and the language they use is that the jury has to be from the state and district where the crime was committed.\" This is called the Vicinage Clause. That leaves you with a sort of venn diagram. You have the right to demand jury from that middle area, where the state in which you committed the crime, that's Idaho, overlaps with the judicial jurisdiction where you committed the crime: the Wyoming district that has jurisdiction over Yellowstone National Park.

{"page": 35, "lesson": 20, "title": "How do you get rid of acne?", "category": "Philosophy", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/7Qn0PaKa", "transcript": {"en": "Imagine waking up the morning of prom, or\nyour wedding day, or a big job interview… and sure enough, you look in the mirror to\nfind your forehead is covered in zits! It’s happened to lots of us. Acne, or acne vulgaris, is the most common\nskin disease in humans. It affects about 80% of people at some point\nin their lives. Most people get acne between the ages of 11\nand 30, but sometimes older people continue to struggle with it, too. Acne happens when follicles and pores become\nclogged with dead skin cells and oils. And … it sucks. But by studying how acne forms, doctors have\ndeveloped ways to prevent and treat it. It all starts with your skin: a complex organ\nmade up of two layers and lots of nerves, blood vessels, and glands. Your skin cells regenerate about once a month,\nso you constantly have dead skin cells sloughing off, and new skin cells rising to the surface. This whole skin-replacement thing isn’t\nmuch of a problem, on its own. But lots of these dead skin cells come out\nthrough your pores. And pores make things more complicated. Skin pores are essentially just openings for\ntiny hairs. Hair follicles, the root ends of the hairs,\nare embedded in your skin and surrounded by clusters of sebaceous glands, special glands\nthat produce sebum. Sebum is that oily, waxy stuff that comes\nout of your pores. It helps keep your skin waterproof and moisturized:\nit keeps excess water out of your body, and it keeps water already inside you from getting\nout through your skin. So, sebum is important. But things can go very wrong if your sebum\nproduction gets out of whack. When your body doesn’t produce enough sebum,\nyour skin can dry out, making you more susceptible to bacterial or fungal infections. But if your body produces too much sebum,\nit can build up inside your pores, trap dead skin cells, and cause a blockage. Increased sebum production is one of the major\nfactors involved in the development of acne. Increased keratin production is another one. Keratin is a protein produced by your hair\nfollicles. It gives structure to each strand of hair,\nas well as the top layer of your skin. But when the hair follicles produce too much\nkeratin, the extra protein binds together dead skin cells, so they can’t just shed\nout of the pore like they normally would. You end up with a blockage that then traps\nmore dead skin cells, plus sebum. Once the pore is officially clogged, it becomes\na breeding ground for colonies of bacteria — especially Propionibacterium acnes. That’s a species of commensal bacteria,\nwhich basically means it’s friendly. It naturally lives on your skin, and it’s\nnot harmful … most of the time. The commensal bacteria that make up your microbiome\nprobably even help prevent other, more harmful bacteria from colonizing on your skin. So having colonies of Propionibacterium acnes\nliving on you isn’t a bad thing. You want them there — as long as they stay\non the surface of your skin. When the bacteria find their way deep into\nskin pores where they don’t belong, that’s when they can cause an infection. And infections often cause inflammation. When you get an infection, your immune system\nresponds by increasing blood flow to the area and sending extra immune cells and enzymes\nto fight off the infection. Different combinations of symptoms cause different\nkinds of acne, with names you’ve probably heard before:Blackheads, whiteheads, pimples,\npustules … technically, they all mean different things. The scientific term for a clogged pore is\na comedo, which actually used to mean a parasitic worm. People started using the term to refer to\na clogged pore because the stuff that comes out when you squeeze it looks kind of like\na worm. When the main symptom is just that the pore\nis clogged, without much inflammation, that’s either a blackhead or a whitehead. Blackheads are what it’s called when the\ncomedo is open. The trapped sebum and dead skin cells become\noxidized, which turns the surface of the clogged material into a dark color, kind of like how\nsilver tarnishes. When the comedo closes, skin cells grow over\nthe top of the plug and stop this oxidation from happening, so the whitish color of the\nsebum shows through. That’s called a whitehead. When there’s a comedo plus an infection\nthat causes inflammation, that’s a different kind of acne: pimples! The typical reddish bumpy kind are more specifically\ncalled papules. If the inflammation gets really bad, sometimes\nthe bumps start leaking fluid or bacteria-filled pus. Those kind are categorized as pustules, and\nthey’re usually a much brighter red, or sometimes white from the oozing fluid. The most severe kind of acne is generally\ncalled cystic acne. That’s when the infection takes root in\nthe deepest layers of the skin. Sometimes the infection causes more solid\nbumps to form, called nodules. And sometimes the infection causes pus-filled\nbumps, called cysts. So that’s how acne happens. But what causes it in the first place? What makes healthy pores become clogged, infected,\nand sometimes ooze-y? Again, there are a few different factors involved. Genetics seem to be important, for one thing. So if your parents had acne, you’re more\nlikely to have it too. Hormones also have a huge influence on acne\n— specifically, androgen hormones, like testosterone, which influence the development\nof both the male and female reproductive systems. Which explains why acne is so much more of\na problem during puberty. Androgen hormones are linked to sebum production. So during puberty, when the hormones are highly\nactive, there’s an increase in sebum production. Increased stress has been thought to increase\nhormone production, as well. So if you find yourself breaking out the day\nbefore a big test, that’s probably why. When you’re stressed, you produce more hormones,\nwhich then increases your sebum production. Since sebum is an oil, a lot of people say\nthat greasy foods will cause acne. Sometimes you’ll also hear that dairy makes\nit worse, or even more specific foods, like chocolate. But the truth is, scientists aren’t really\nsure how or whether diet and acne are connected. There have been lots of studies investigating\nthis, and some do suggest a possible link. But others don’t. We need more comprehensive, controlled trials\nwith plenty of subjects before we can come to any real conclusions. Doctors do acknowledge that there’s anecdotal\nevidence, and they say that if changing your diet has helped with your acne, then it makes\nsense for you to stick with it. There just isn’t enough evidence to support\nthe idea that diet has a role in acne in general. But we do know that exposure to other topical\noils, like some cosmetics or moisturizers, can cause acne by blocking your pores with\nextra oils and trapping sebum. It’s easy to avoid the problem, though — just\nlook for products that say they’re non-comedogenic, which means that they shouldn’t clog your\npores. But the natural oil on your face isn’t really\na problem. You’ll often hear that you should wash your\nface a lot to help prevent acne, but acne isn’t caused by dirt or by the natural oil\nthat’s already on the surface of your skin. And washing your face too much can actually\nirritate your skin, making acne worse. To treat acne, the goal is to reduce the factors\nthat come together to cause breakouts. The one thing you shouldn’t do is pop a\nzit. The big risk is that you’ll push the infection\nout of the hair follicle and into the surrounding skin, instead of out to the surface. Plus, you’ll irritate the area, causing\nmore inflammation and making the acne take longer to heal. You might also spread bacteria to non-affected\npores. Instead, treatments try to lower sebum production,\nstop dead cells from clumping together in the pore as much, prevent bacterial growth,\nand lower inflammation. Treatments can range from mild to aggressive,\ndepending on how severe the symptoms are. For mild acne like blackheads and whiteheads,\nyou can usually use topical over-the-counter medications. One of the most effective is benzoyl peroxide,\na chemical compound that’s really good at killing bacteria. It decomposes into super reactive forms of\noxygen, which bind to and destroy the molecules the bacteria need to survive. Another common treatment is salicylic acid,\nwhich doesn’t kill the bacteria, but stops them from replicating. It can also break down skin cells and keratin\nto help unclog the pores Inflammatory acne, like papular pimples or\ncystic acne, sometimes needs stronger treatment to reduce the inflammation. That usually means prescription meds. ###Antibiotics — the kind that are also\nused to treat other bacterial infections, from strep throat to urinary tract infections\n— can be used to treat acne. They stop bacterial growth and reduce inflammation. Another kind of treatment involves retinoids,\nwhich are compounds related to vitamin A. Retinoids work by binding to skin cell receptors\nto remove dead skin cells and encourage healthy skin cell growth. So retinoids work really well to unclog pores\nfull of dead skin cells. They’re anti-inflammatory, too. In severe cystic acne cases, stronger retinoids\nactually work at the deeper layers of skin to reduce the size of the oil glands so they\nproduce less sebum. And since hormones are a big factor in sebum\nproduction, using birth control or corticosteroids can regulate female hormones and reduce the\namount of androgen hormones being produced. Fewer androgen receptors at work means less\nsebum production, which means less acne. Sometimes, severe, cystic acne will leave\nscarring, but there are ways to reduce it. These procedures don’t necessarily treat\nor prevent the acne itself, but they can reduce the bumps and scars left over from bad breakouts. Dermabrasion uses a gentle sanding tool to\nwear down layers of the skin that have scarred over from cystic acne, but it only works for\npeople with lighter skin. This procedure has mostly been replaced by\nlaser resurfacing, which uses laser pulses to remove skin layer by layer until the scar\nhas smoothed out. Then there are chemical peels, which use compounds\nlike salicylic acid or retinoic acid to perform what’s basically a controlled injury to\nthe top layer of skin, killing the top layer of cells. The dead skin cells peel off, revealing healthy\nskin cells underneath. Luckily, most people grow out of the acne-ridden\nyears of puberty, though some people will continue to have acne well into their 40s\nand 50s. But even though a bad breakout might make\nyou self-conscious, it’s normal, it’s treatable, and it’s not life-threatening. So take care of your skin, talk to your doctor\nabout prescription treatments if you want them, and trust that your acne will probably\nget better with age.

One 20th century philosopher \neven went so far as to describe all of Western philosophy\nas a series of footnotes to Plato. He created the first Western university and was teacher to Ancient Greece's \ngreatest minds, including Aristotle. But even one of the founders of philosophy\nwasn't perfect. Along with his great ideas, Plato had a few that haven't \nexactly stood the test of time. So here are brief rundowns\nof a few of his best and worst ideas. Plato argued that beyond\nour imperfect world was a perfect unchanging world of Forms. Forms are the ideal versions of the things\nand concepts we see around us. They serve as a sort of instruction\nmanual to our own world. Floating around the world of Forms\nis the ideal tree, and the ideal YouTube channel, and even the ideal justice, or ideal love. Our own reality is comprised of imperfect\ncopies of ideal Forms. Plato argued that philosophers\nshould strive to contemplate and understand these perfect Forms so that they may better navigate\nour misleading reality. While it may seem silly, the disconnect between the world\nas it appears and the greater truth behind it is one of philosophy's\nmost vexing problems. It's been the subject of thousands\nof pages by theologians, philosophers, and screenwriters alike. It raises questions like should we trust\nour senses to come to the truth or our own reason? For Plato, the answer is reason. It alone provides us with at least\nthe potential to contemplate the Forms. But reason didn't always pan out\nfor Plato himself. When he sought to situate humankind\namongst the animals, he lumped us in with birds. \"Featherless bipeds\" \nwas his official designation. Diogenes the Cynic,\nannoyed by this definition, stormed into Plato's class\nwith a plucked chicken, announcing, \"Behold. Plato's man.\" But back to a few good ideas. Plato is one of the earliest \npolitical theorists on record, and with Aristotle, is seen as one \nof the founders of political science. He reasoned that being a ruler\nwas no different than any other craft, whether a potter or doctor, and that only those who had mastered\nthe craft were fit to lead. Ruling was the craft \nof contemplating the Forms. In his Republic, Plato imagined a utopia\nwhere justice is the ultimate goal. Plato's ideal city seeks a harmonious\nbalance between its individual parts and should be lead by a philosopher king. Millennia before his time, Plato also reasoned that women were\nequally able to rule in this model city. Unfortunately, Plato was inconsistent\nwith women, elsewhere likening them to children. He also believed that a woman's\nwomb was a live animal that could wander around in her body\nand cause illness. This bad idea, also espoused by other\ncontemporaries of Plato, was sadly influential for hundreds\nof years in European medicine. Furthermore, he thought that society\nshould be divided into three groups: producers, the military, and the rulers, and that a great noble lie should convince\neveryone to follow this structure. The noble lie he proposed was that we're all born with gold, \nsilver, or a mixture of brass and iron in our souls, which determine our roles in life. Some thinkers have gone on\nto credit the idea of the noble lie as a prototype for 20th century\npropaganda, and the philosopher king as inspiration\nfor the dictators that used them. Should a few bad ideas tarnish Plato's status as one \nof the greatest philosophers in history? No! Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who\ncame after him a place to start. Through the centuries, we've had the chance to test those ideas\nthrough writing and experience, and have accepted some\nwhile rejecting others. We are continuing to refine,\namend, and edit his ideas which have become foundations\nof the modern world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Plato wrote:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Politics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Republic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Cosmopolis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Agora"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Plato created the first ___ in the Western world.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gym"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Parliament"}, {"label": "C", "text": "University"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Legal association"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Plato argued that beyond our imperfect and changing world was a realm of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Divine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Constellations"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Happiness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Forms"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "According to Plato, the Forms are:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The ideal version of things in our world"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Outlines of things we experience"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Built into the objects we experience"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Identical with their objects"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Plato wrote:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Politics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Republic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Cosmopolis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Agora"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "There are three groups in Plato’s ideal society.

It's some of the most familiar\nof all early 18th century music. It's been featured in uncounted films\nand television commercials, but what is it \nand why does it sound that way? This is the opening of \"Spring\"\nfrom \"The Four Seasons,\" by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi. \"The Four Seasons\" are famous in part\nbecause they are a delight to the ear. However, even more notable is the fact that \nthey have stories to tell. At the time of their publication\nin Amsterdam in 1725, they were accompanied by poems describing exactly what feature\nof that season Vivaldi intended to capture \nin musical terms. In providing specific plot content\nfor instrumental music, Vivaldi was generations ahead of his time. If one were to read the poems\nsimultaneously to hearing the music, one would find the poetic scenes synchronizing nicely \nwith the musical imagery. We are told that the birds welcome\nspring with happy song, and here they are doing exactly that. Soon, however, \na thunderstorm breaks out. Not only is there musical thunder\nand lightning, there are also more birds, wet, frightened, and unhappy. In \"Summer,\" the turtle dove sings \nher name \"tortorella\" in Italian, before a hail storm flattens the fields. \"Autumn\" brings eager hunters dashing\nout in pursuit of their prey. The \"Winter\" concerto begins with teeth\nchattering in the cold before one takes refuge by\na crackling fire. Then it's back out into the storm where there'll be slips \nand falls on the ice. In these first weeks of winter,\nthe old year is coming to a close, and so does Vivaldi's musical exploration\nof the seasons. Not until the early 19th century would such expressive instrumental\nprogram music, as it was known, become popular. By then, larger, more varied ensembles\nwere the rule with woodwinds, brass, and percussion\nto help tell the tale. But Vivaldi pulled it off with just\none violin, strings, and a harpsichord. Unlike his contemporary Bach, Vivaldi wasn't much interested\nin complicated fugues. He preferred to offer readily\naccessible entertainment to his listeners with melodies that pop back up later\nin a piece to remind us of where we've been. So the first movement of the \"Spring\"\nconcerto begins with a theme for spring and ends with it, too, slightly varied\nfrom when it was last heard. It was an inspired way \nto attract listeners, and Vivaldi, considered one of the most electrifying \nviolinists of the early 18th century, understood the value \nof attracting audiences. Such concerts might feature himself\nas the star violinist. Others presented the young musicians\nof the Pietà, a Venetian girls' school\nwhere Vivaldi was Director of Music. Most of the students were orphans. Music training was intended not only\nas social skills suitable for young ladies but also as potential careers for those who might fail\nto make good marriages. Even in the composer's own time, Vivaldi's music served \nas diversion for all, not just for the wealthy aristocrats. 300 years later, it's an approach\nthat still works, and Vivaldi's music still sounds\nlike trotting horses on the move."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately when did Vivaldi compose his Four Seasons?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Early 1600's"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Early 1700's"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Early 1800's"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Early 1900's"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the featured solo instrument in The Four Seasons concertos?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Flute"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Piano"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Guitar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Violin"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the term for instrumental music that has a story to tell?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Opera"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Program music"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sonata"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Song"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What other superstar composer lived at the same time as Vivaldi?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tchaikovsky"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mozart"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Beethovan"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In what country did Vivaldi live?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "France"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Italy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Germany"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Poland"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

But most of her audience didn’t actually read that book. They read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s stone. or Harry Potter A L'Ecole des Sorciers Harry Potter va Sang-e Jadu Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal [cool humming of \"Hedwig's Theme\" ] The bewitching Harry Potter books have reached readers in over 200 territories in over 60 languages. The authorized translations came from separate publishing houses with little oversight from the author. So translators were not only tasked with adapting the text from english into their target languages and cultures, but also making assumptions about Rowling’s intentions and translating the spirit of her approach. Their task was particularly challenging because the Harry Potter series is filled with invented words, alliteration, wordplay, and British cultural references. The main characters first names: Harry, Hermione, and Ron mostly stayed the same across languages, with small changes to accommodate different alphabets and phonetics. That’s easy enough for conventional names like Harry Potter. But many of the other proper names in the book carry loaded meanings — meanings that would be lost if it’s not translated. Take Severus Snape. The name invokes severity and sounds like “snake.” So the Italian translator made the jump and named him Severus Piton —which is basically python. In French, he’s Severus Rogue which means Severus \"Arrogance\". As you can tell, both solutions sacrificed Rowling’s alliteration. The name “Hogwarts” combines two English words, but because the name stayed the same in most languages, those connotations were lost for those readers. In an attempt to preserve Rowling’s approach to the school’s name, the French translator used “Poudlard.” \"Pou du lard\" means lice of bacon or fat. The Hungarian version went with “Roxfort” a mix of the British university Oxford and Roquefort—a well known blue cheese. The house names and founders, also experienced unique adaptations in some of the target languages. In Catalan the names became: Nícanor Griffindor, Sírpentin Slytherin, Mari Pau Ravenclaw, and Horténsia Hufflepuff. There’s a ton of word play that happens in the Harry Potter books as well. The famous Diagon Alley, a play on the word \"diagonally\" and the infamous Knockturn Alley from \"nocturnally\". This type of pun is a real puzzle for translators, and most dropped it in favor of literal translations. The Spanish translator was able to rhyme at least with “callejón diagon.” And translators had several approaches to  Quidditch, an invented game made from the invented words Quaffle, Bludger, and Snitch— the 3 types of balls used in the game. In Spanish, the words were not changed. The French translator kept the word Quidditch but changed the names of the balls. And others changed the game’s name altogether. In Dutch, quidditch is “Zwerkbal.” In Norwegian, it’s “Rumpeldunk.\" OWLS and NEWTS, standardized tests in the wizarding world, weren’t always able to retain their animal acronyms. But in Swedish their implied meanings remained while the wording was changed. OWLs became Grund Examen i Trollkonst or G.E.T meaning goat in Swedish. And NEWTs were changed to Fruktansvärt Utmattande Trollkarls Test or F.U.T.T. derived from \"futtig\" meaning measly or mean. The infamous anagram of Tom Marvolo Riddle’s name was altered by many translators to achieve the same revelation of “I Am Lord Voldemort.” In Danish, Tom is named \"Romeo G. Detlev Jr.\" and in French he is “Tom Elvis Jedusor” which was extra clever because \"Jeu du sort\" means “fate riddle.” Culturally, the Harry Potter series is unmistakably British but translating that for a global group of readers wasn’t easy. Some food items were changed to make them less foreign for the target country. Sherbet lemons, a popular candy item in Britain, became krembo, a chocolate covered sweet from Israel. Crisps became chips in the US and in the Arabic version, bacon became eggs. Sometimes a foreign setting undergoes translation too. For the Ukrainian translation, the atmosphere of an English boarding school was swapped out for an orphanage. In the books and films, Hagrid has a provincial west country accent. Hagrid: \"No? Blimey Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?\" \"You're a wizard, Harry.\" For the Japanese translations, it was replicated by using Tōhoku dialect, which is a pastoral accent from northeastern Japan. Other translators chose to have Hagrid simply speak more informally, while others dropped his accent entirely. Despite translators’ best efforts to remain true to the text some things still were lost in translation. In the mainland Chinese editions of Harry Potter there were footnotes to explain puns and cultural references. The Spanish translator sometimes used italics to signal an invented word with no translation. But in the end, it doesn’t matter if you’re reading Harry Potter and Philosopher’s Stone or the many translations of it. One thing that always seems to translate is the love fans around the world share for tales of \"The Boy Who Lived.\""}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are some factors that make it challenging to translate Harry Potter?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "word play"}, {"label": "B", "text": "hidden meanings"}, {"label": "C", "text": "connotation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "alliteration"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}
