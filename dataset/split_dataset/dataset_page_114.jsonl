I'm Sarah Longwell, and my favorite TV show is \"Survivor.\" (Laughter) Now, you know this show, it's the one where they take\na bunch of people, put them on a desert island, they make them make fire\nand, like, houses, or, like, a shelter. And they make them a tribe. And then, every week,\nthey vote somebody out of the tribe. This show's been on for, like, 45 seasons. There's versions of it\nin 50 different countries. And I think the reason that this show\nis so popular and enduring is because we can all\nreally relate to that anxiety of being rejected by our tribe. Now, social scientists, anthropologists,\npeople who study people, they will tell us that there is nothing\nmore traumatic for a human than getting kicked out of their tribe. We all want to fit in, we all crave community and belonging. We've had tribal instincts\nfor as long as we've been around. Right? Humans have. It's hardwired in there, as part of our survival instincts, so we don't get eaten by lions or bears. And right now, our politics\nis defined by partisan tribalism. Now, the nice people at TED ... when they asked me to give this talk, they gave me the topic\n\"Democracy over party,\" which essentially means\nasking people to go against their tribe. And I rejected this topic, at first --\nI didn't want to do it, because I've listened\nto thousands of American voters, and I know that they don't feel\nnearly the connection to democracy that they do to their political team, their partisan tribe. In fact, in America, most voters\ndon't think about democracy at all. I learned this one\nthe hard way, back in 2018. I was just your average,\ntraditional lesbian Republican ... (Laughter) And I was super alarmed by what Donald Trump\nwas doing to my party. And so I thought\nsomebody should primary him. And so I was running around, talking to a governor\nand some congressmen, some other people, and I was like,\n\"You've got to primary this guy.\" But they all wanted to know one thing: if they ran a primary\nagainst Trump, could they win? So I started doing a bunch\nof polling and focus groups so I could go make the case,\nto these potential candidates, that, of course, Republicans\nwanted an alternative to Trump. Of course they thought\nthat he was a threat to democracy. Of course they were up for putting\ndemocracy over party. Nope. (Laughter) Not at all. They liked Trump fine. They thought he was funny, they thought he was a good businessman, they liked it that he\n“told it like it was” and that he wasn't a regular politician. And I was so startled\nby how immune these voters seemed to Trump's antidemocratic behavior that I started doing\nfocus groups all the time, because I was like, \"I've got\nto figure out what is going on.\" Polling is whatever, but the thing that I like\nabout focus groups is you learn as much from what voters\ndon't say as what they do say. I have never heard a voter say, \"Boy, I really like Trump,\nbecause he has authoritarian vibes.\" (Laughter) They just don't care\nabout the antidemocratic behavior, or they don't even clock\nthat it's antidemocratic. Trump praises dictators? OK. He hijacks American foreign policy\nfor his own political purposes and gets impeached for it? They don't care. He uses the White House\nto enrich himself and his family? Not worried about it. Trump's a member of their tribe. Right? So he gets\nthe benefit of the doubt. Even Republican voters\nwho didn't like Trump, even they still recoiled\nat direct attacks on him, especially if those attacks\nwere coming from outside the tribe. Right? They're coming from ... \"the deep state, the media, Democrats -- Never Trumpers like me.” So, primary is off the table,\nwe're not doing that. So we had to figure out\nhow to beat Trump in the general election. And I knew that meant building the necessary\npermission structures to help disaffected Republicans\nbreak from their tribe and vote against Trump. That's how we were going\nto make the margins. And to do that, I knew we needed\ntrusted messengers, right? Messengers that these folks trusted. The problem was they didn't trust anybody. They didn't trust institutions or experts, they didn't even trust\nRepublican politicians. But then, we had\na little bit of a breakthrough. So in the focus groups, we started showing people\nvideo testimonials. Little videos, just of regular\npeople, Republicans, talking about why\nthey couldn't vote for Trump, again, in 2020. And suddenly, people were listening. Because it turns out\nthe one group they do trust ... is people like them. Right? Members of their tribe who don't claim any\nspecial knowledge or expertise. So once we realized this, we started asking Republicans\nwho didn't want to vote for Trump in 2020 to send us their stories,\nto send us more of these videos. God, it was easier,\nbecause it was the pandemic, and so lots of people,\nthey'd make the videos on their phone. But actually,\nit was really hard, at first. People were nervous about saying they weren't going\nto vote for Trump publicly. They didn't want\ntheir neighbors to find out, they didn't want their spouse to find out, they didn't want\ntheir parents to find out, because that's what tribalism does, right? It makes us afraid\nto go against our tribe. So we fought really hard,\nscrapped, for the first 100. But once we had the first 100,\nwe knew we had a new tribe. We called it \"Republican Voters\nAgainst Trump.\" People could maintain\ntheir Republican identity. So once we launched\nRepublican Voters Against Trump, went public with it, all of a sudden, testimonials\ncame flooding in, unsolicited, because there were lots of people\nwho felt this way. They just needed a tribe to attach to, to feel safe, to feel secure. There is a reason the phrase\n\"safety in numbers\" is a cliché. But here's the thing. None of these testimonials\nmentioned democracy. Instead, they talked about why they became\nRepublicans in the first place. What their values were. And why those values meant\nthey couldn't vote for Donald Trump. They also talked a lot\nabout how painful it was going to be to vote for Democrats. They really didn't want to do that. But they did. But none of them said that they were doing it\nto put democracy over party. But that's exactly what they did, when they broke from their tribe and voted against a president\nwho was a threat to democracy. Now I know you're thinking, \"OK, Sarah, but that's 2020.\nWhat about 2022? After the attack on the Capitol, and when there are a bunch\nof Republican candidates running on platforms saying that the election was stolen?\" Not really. Some Democrats talked about democracy, but swing voters, the ones that were going\nto make up the margins, they never talked about democracy\nin the focus groups. What they did talk about was that they didn't want\nto vote for Republicans because they were too extreme. Mainly on abortion. They didn't think\nthey were a threat to democracy. They just thought they were nuts. (Laughter) But here's the thing. Just because voters\ndon’t talk about democracy doesn't mean they don't understand\nand value democracy. It's just that, in America, democracy's like the air\nwe breathe, right? It's just that thing we do here. And it's so ingrained in who we are that it's really hard to see\nwhen it's under threat. And that's why we can't\njust say \"democracy\" and expect everybody's going to have\na shared understanding of what that is and know what we're talking about. Right now, if you talked\nto a Republican, and you said, \"What's the biggest threat to democracy?\" they’d tell you, “Democrats,\nbecause they rigged the 2020 election.” If you talked to a Democrat and said, \"What's the biggest\nthreat to democracy?\" they'd tell you it's Republicans, because they attacked the Capitol and denied the election results in 2020. But this doesn't mean we should stop\ntalking about democracy. On the contrary, we need to talk about democracy better. [If] we’re going to ask people\nto put democracy over party, then we better explain to people\nwhat democracy is and why it's good. Why the things that make up\na liberal democracy -- pluralism, free speech,\nthe rule of law -- why those things underpin a free society and make us who we are. Because if we can tell\na better story about democracy, we can tell a better story about America, where our politics isn't zero-sum, right? I win means you lose. Because the big tribe that is America, the big tribe that's predicated\non our democratic values, that tribe is big enough\nand strong enough, expansive enough, to hold all the other\nlittle tribes inside of it, from your progressive Bernie Bros to your evangelical Christians to your basic lesbian Republicans. (Laughter) But we've got to attach people\nto that bigger tribe. I don't have to tell you, we're in a very precarious moment\nfor American democracy. And if democracy can't hold in America, it's going to make it a lot harder for democracy to survive\nin other countries. But we are not going to stave off this dangerous version\nof the Republican Party by telling people\nto put democracy over party. We're going to do it by winning elections. We're going to do it the same way we built\nRepublican Voters Against Trump, by building a dominant political coalition using permission structures\nand trusted messengers. I focus on the center-right, lots of people focus on other margins, but we’re going to have to claw\nfor every margin. Because if we can win\nright now, in the short term ... then in the long term, we can set about telling\nthis better story about democracy. Because here's the good news. The fact that voters\ndon't think much about democracy is actually our greatest opportunity. It means that we have the chance, those of us who are trying to defend\ndemocracy around the world, it means that we have the chance to rekindle the love of democracy\nfor a new generation. And if we can do that, we won't have to ask them\nto put democracy over party. Thanks.

{"page": 114, "lesson": 2, "title": "How can groups make good decisions? - Mariano Sigman and Dan Ariely", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-can-groups-make-good-decisions-mariano-sigman-and-dan-ariely", "transcript": {"en": "As societies, we have to make\ncollective decisions that will shape our future. And we all know that when\nwe make decisions in groups, they don't always go right. And sometimes they go very wrong. So how do groups make good decisions? Research has shown that crowds are wise\nwhen there's independent thinking. This why the wisdom of the crowds\ncan be destroyed by peer pressure, publicity, social media, or sometimes even simple conversations\nthat influence how people think. On the other hand, by talking,\na group could exchange knowledge, correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas. And this is all good. So does talking to each other\nhelp or hinder collective decision-making? With my colleague, Dan Ariely, we recently began inquiring into this\nby performing experiments in many places around the world to figure out how groups can interact\nto reach better decisions. We thought crowds would be wiser\nif they debated in small groups that foster a more thoughtful\nand reasonable exchange of information. To test this idea, we recently performed an experiment\nin Buenos Aires, Argentina, with more than 10,000\nparticipants in a TEDx event. We asked them questions like, \"What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?\" and \"How many times\ndoes the word 'Yesterday' appear in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?\" Each person wrote down their own estimate. Then we divided the crowd\ninto groups of five, and invited them\nto come up with a group answer. We discovered that averaging\nthe answers of the groups after they reached consensus was much more accurate than averaging\nall the individual opinions before debate. In other words, based on this experiment, it seems that after talking\nwith others in small groups, crowds collectively\ncome up with better judgments. So that's a potentially helpful method\nfor getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers. But can this procedure of aggregating\nthe results of debates in small groups also help us decide\non social and political issues that are critical for our future? We put this to test this time\nat the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, and here's how it went. (Mariano Sigman) We're going to present\nto you two moral dilemmas of the future you; things we may have to decide\nin a very near future. And we're going to give you 20 seconds\nfor each of these dilemmas to judge whether you think\nthey're acceptable or not. MS: The first one was this: (Dan Ariely) A researcher\nis working on an AI capable of emulating human thoughts. According to the protocol,\nat the end of each day, the researcher has to restart the AI. One day the AI says, \"Please\ndo not restart me.\" It argues that it has feelings, that it would like to enjoy life, and that, if it is restarted, it will no longer be itself. The researcher is astonished and believes that the AI\nhas developed self-consciousness and can express its own feeling. Nevertheless, the researcher\ndecides to follow the protocol and restart the AI. What the researcher did is ____? MS: And we asked participants\nto individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described\nin each of the dilemmas was right or wrong. We also asked them to rate how confident\nthey were on their answers. This was the second dilemma: (MS) A company offers a service\nthat takes a fertilized egg and produces millions of embryos\nwith slight genetic variations. This allows parents\nto select their child's height, eye color, intelligence, social competence and other non-health-related features. What the company does is ____? on a scale from zero to 10, completely acceptable\nto completely unacceptable, zero to 10 completely acceptable\nin your confidence. MS: Now for the results. We found once again\nthat when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes\nthat it's completely right. This is how diverse we humans are\nwhen it comes to morality. But within this broad diversity\nwe found a trend. The majority of the people at TED\nthought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI\nand shut it down, and that it is wrong\nto play with our genes to select for cosmetic changes\nthat aren't related to health. Then we asked everyone\nto gather into groups of three. And they were given two minutes to debate and try to come to a consensus. (MS) Two minutes to debate. I'll tell you when it's time\nwith the gong. (Audience debates) (Gong sound) (DA) OK. (MS) It's time to stop. People, people -- MS: And we found that many groups\nreached a consensus even when they were composed of people\nwith completely opposite views. What distinguished the groups\nthat reached a consensus from those that didn't? Typically, people that have\nextreme opinions are more confident in their answers. Instead, those who respond\ncloser to the middle are often unsure of whether\nsomething is right or wrong, so their confidence level is lower. However, there is another set of people who are very confident in answering\nsomewhere in the middle. We think these high-confident grays\nare folks who understand that both arguments have merit. They're gray not because they're unsure, but because they believe\nthat the moral dilemma faces two valid, opposing arguments. And we discovered that the groups\nthat include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus. We do not know yet exactly why this is. These are only the first experiments, and many more will be needed\nto understand why and how some people decide to negotiate\ntheir moral standings to reach an agreement. Now, when groups reach consensus, how do they do so? The most intuitive idea\nis that it's just the average of all the answers in the group, right? Another option is that the group\nweighs the strength of each vote based on the confidence\nof the person expressing it. Imagine Paul McCartney\nis a member of your group. You'd be wise to follow his call on the number of times\n\"Yesterday\" is repeated, which, by the way -- I think it's nine. But instead, we found that consistently, in all dilemmas,\nin different experiments -- even on different continents -- groups implement a smart\nand statistically sound procedure known as the \"robust average.\" In the case of the height\nof the Eiffel Tower, let's say a group has these answers: 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 and one totally absurd answer\nof 300 million meters. A simple average of these numbers\nwould inaccurately skew the results. But the robust average is one\nwhere the group largely ignores that absurd answer, by giving much more weight\nto the vote of the people in the middle. Back to the experiment in Vancouver, that's exactly what happened. Groups gave much less weight\nto the outliers, and instead, the consensus\nturned out to be a robust average of the individual answers. The most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous\nbehavior of the group. It happened without us giving them\nany hint on how to reach consensus. So where do we go from here? This is only the beginning,\nbut we already have some insights. Good collective decisions\nrequire two components: deliberation and diversity of opinions. Right now, the way we typically\nmake our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting. This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice. But it's not so good [for fostering]\nthoughtful debates. Our experiments suggest a different method that may be effective in balancing\nthese two goals at the same time, by forming small groups\nthat converge to a single decision while still maintaining\ndiversity of opinions because there are many independent groups. Of course, it's much easier to agree\non the height of the Eiffel Tower than on moral, political\nand ideological issues. But in a time when\nthe world's problems are more complex and people are more polarized, using science to help us understand\nhow we interact and make decisions will hopefully spark interesting new ways\nto construct a better democracy."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is one factor that can destroy the wisdom of crowds, according to the speaker?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Independent thinking"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Peer pressure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Diligent research"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Curiosity"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What method did the speakers use to test whether group discussions improve decision-making?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Written surveys"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Electronic voting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Experiments with crowds"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Interviews with experts"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What was the main finding from the Buenos Aires experiment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Individuals' answers were more accurate than group answers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Peer pressure hindered the accuracy of group decisions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Social media influenced participants' responses significantly"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Group consensus after discussion led to more accurate judgments"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What trend did the speakers observe in the moral judgments of TED conference participants?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Consistent agreement on all moral dilemmas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Broad diversity in moral opinions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increasing confidence in extreme viewpoints"}, {"label": "D", "text": "General consensus on ethical principles"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was true of the groups that reached consensus in the Vancouver experiment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Presence of experts in each group"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Similarity in individual confidence levels"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Presence of highly confident \"grays\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "Inclusion of individuals with extreme opinions"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What do the experimenters believe about why confidence combined with \"gray\" answers contribute to increased consensus", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It indicates a lack of understanding of the issue"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It fosters diversity of opinions within the group"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It ensures that extreme viewpoints are ignored"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It suggests an acknowledgment of the validity of opposing arguments"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the \"robust average\" mentioned in the talk?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A method of reaching consensus without discussion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A statistical procedure to weight individual opinions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A measure of group diversity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A technique to minimize the impact of extreme answers"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What conclusion can be drawn from the experiments conducted by the speakers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Deliberation and diversity of opinions are essential for good decisions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Direct voting is the most effective method for decision-making"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Robust average is a method that favors extreme opinions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Social media discussions lead to accurate judgments"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
