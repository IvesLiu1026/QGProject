By now, these have become standard \nelements in many modern horror stories. But they were largely popularized \nby a single author– one whose name has become an adjective for the particular type of \nterror he inspired. Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, Howard Phillips Lovecraft grew up \nadmiring the Gothic horror stories written by Edgar Allan Poe \nand Robert Chambers. But by the time he began writing in 1917, World War I had cast a long \nshadow over the arts. People had seen real horrors, and were no longer frightened \nof fantastical folklore. Lovecraft sought to invent a \nnew kind of terror, one that responded to the rapid \nscientific progress of his era. His stories often used scientific elements\nto lend eerie plausibility. In \"The Colour out of Space,\" a strange meteorite falls near \na farmhouse, mutating the farm into a \nnightmarish hellscape. Others incorporated scientific \nmethodology into their form. \"At the Mountains of Madness\" is written \nas a report of an Antarctic expedition that unearths things better \nleft undiscovered. In others, mathematics themselves \nbecome a source of horror, as impossible geometric configurations wreak havoc on the minds of \nany who behold them. Like then-recent discoveries of \nsubatomic particles or X-rays, the forces in Lovecraft’s fiction \nwere powerful, yet often invisible and indescribable. Rather than recognizable monsters,\ngraphic violence, or startling shocks, the terror of “Lovecraftian” horror lies \nin what’s not directly portrayed– but left instead to the dark depths \nof our imagination. Lovecraft’s dozens of short stories, \nnovellas, and poems often take place in the same \nfictional continuity, with recurring characters, locations, \nand mythologies. At first glance, they appear to be set within Lovecraft’s \ncontemporary New England. But beneath the surface of this seemingly \nsimilar reality lie dark masters, for whom Earth’s inhabitants \nare mere playthings. More like primordial forces \nthan mere deities, Lovecraft’s Great Old Ones lurk at \nthe corners of our reality. Beings such as Yog-Sothoth, “who froths as primal slime \nin nuclear chaos beyond the nethermost outposts \nof space and time.” Or the blind, idiot god Azathoth, whose destructive impulses are \nstalled only by the “maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine \nof accursed flutes.” These beings exist beyond our \nconceptions of reality, their true forms as inscrutable \nas their motives. Lovecraft’s protagonists– often researchers, anthropologists, \nor antiquarians– stumble onto hints of their existence. But even these indirect glimpses are \nenough to drive them insane. And if they survive, the reader is left with no feeling of \ntriumph, only cosmic indifference– the terrible sense that we are \nbut insignificant specks at the mercy of unfathomable forces. But perhaps the greatest power \nthese creatures had was their appeal to Lovecraft’s \ncontemporaries. During his lifetime, Lovecraft corresponded \nwith other writers, encouraging them to employ elements and \ncharacters from his stories in their own. References to Lovecraftian gods \nor arcane tomes can be found in many stories \nby his pen pals, such as Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Today, this shared universe is called \nthe Cthulhu Mythos, named after Lovecraft’s infamous blend \nof dragon and octopus. Unfortunately, Lovecraft’s fear of the unknown found \na less savory expression in his personal views. The author held strong racist views, and some of his works include \ncrude stereotypes and slurs. But the rich world he created would \noutlive his personal prejudices. And after Lovecraft’s death, the Cthulhu Mythos was adopted \nby a wide variety of authors, often reimagining them from \ndiverse perspectives that transcend the author’s prejudices. Despite his literary legacy, Lovecraft was never able to \nfind financial success. He died unknown and penniless \nat the age of 46– a victim of the universe’s cosmic \nindifference. But his work has inspired numerous \nshort stories, novels, tabletop games, and cultural icons. And as long as humans feel a sense of \ndread about our unknown future, Lovecraftian horror will have a place in \nthe darkest corners of our imagination."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Lovecraft admired the work of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stephen King"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Jane Austen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Jorge Luis Borges"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Edgar Allan Poe and Robert Chambers"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Lovecraft often incorporated ____ into his stories.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Folklore"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Superstition"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Scientific elements"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Metanarratives"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Lovecraft’s stories often leave us with a sense of cosmic indifference, which is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The feeling that we are insignificant specks in the universe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The idea that we are powerful creatures in charge of our destiny"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A theory of biological processes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The Cthulhu Mythos is a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Role-playing game"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Shared universe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Series of movies"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The title of a short story"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Lovecraft’s work has inspired numerous:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Video games"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Short stories and novels"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Movies"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Comic books"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

This wasn’t just any cable. It was a souped-up version \nof fiber optics— the hidden network that links our planet and makes the internet possible. For decades, long-distance communications \nbetween cities and countries were carried by electrical signals, in wires made of copper. This was slow and inefficient, with metal wires limiting data rates \nand power lost as wasted heat. But in the late 20th century, engineers mastered a far superior method\nof transmission. Instead of metal, glass can be carefully melted and \ndrawn into flexible fiber strands, hundreds of kilometers long \nand no thicker than human hair. And instead of electricity, these strands carry pulses of light, \nrepresenting digital data. But how does light travel within glass, \nrather than just pass through it? The trick lies in a phenomenon known \nas total internal reflection. Since Isaac Newton’s time, lensmakers and scientists have \nknown that light bends when it passes between air and \nmaterials like water or glass. When a ray of light inside glass hits its \nsurface at a steep angle, it refracts, or bends \nas it exits into air. But if the ray travels at a shallow angle, it’ll bend so far that it stays trapped, bouncing along inside the glass. Under the right condition, something normally transparent to light\ncan instead hide it from the world. Compared to electricity or radio, fiber optic signals barely degrade \nover great distances— a little power does scatter away, and fibers can’t bend too sharply, otherwise the light leaks out. Today, a single optical fiber carries many\nwavelengths of light, each a different channel of data. And a fiber optic cable contains hundreds \nof these fiber strands. Over a million kilometers of cable \ncrisscross our ocean floors to link the continents— that’s enough to wind around the \nEquator nearly thirty times. With fiber optics, distance hardly limits data, which has allowed the internet to evolve\ninto a planetary computer. Increasingly, our mobile work and play rely on legions \nof overworked computer servers, warehoused in gigantic data centers \nflung across the world. This is called cloud computing, and it leads to two big problems: heat waste and bandwidth demand. The vast majority of internet traffic \nshuttles around inside data centers, where thousands of servers are connected \nby traditional electrical cables. Half of their running power \nis wasted as heat. Meanwhile, wireless bandwidth demand \nsteadily marches on, and the gigahertz signals used in our \nmobile devices are reaching their data delivery limits. It seems fiber optics has been too good\nfor its own good, fueling overly-ambitious cloud and mobile\ncomputing expectations. But a related technology, integrated \nphotonics, has come to the rescue. Light can be guided not \nonly in optical fibers, but also in ultrathin silicon wires. Silicon wires don’t guide light\nas well as fiber. But they do enable engineers to shrink all the devices in a hundred kilometer \nfiber optic network down to tiny photonic chips that plug\ninto servers and convert their electrical signals \nto optical and back. These electricity-to-light chips allow for\nwasteful electrical cables in data centers to be swapped out for \npower-efficient fiber. Photonic chips can help break open \nwireless bandwidth limitations, too. Researchers are working to replace mobile\ngigahertz signals with terahertz frequencies, to carry data thousands of times faster. But these are short-range signals: they get absorbed by moisture in the air, or blocked by tall buildings. With tiny wireless-to-fiber photonic \ntransmitter chips distributed throughout cities, terahertz signals can be relayed over \nlong-range distances. They can do so via a stable middleman, optical fiber, and make hyperfast \nwireless connectivity a reality. For all of human history, light has gifted us with sight and heat, serving as a steady companion while we\nexplored and settled the physical world. Now, we’ve saddled light with information\nand redirected it to run along a fiber optic superhighway— with many different integrated \nphotonic exits— to build an even more expansive, \nvirtual world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are the two ways copper metal wires influence the transmission of information as electrical signals?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "data rate and distance"}, {"label": "B", "text": "distance and time"}, {"label": "C", "text": "data rate and power"}, {"label": "D", "text": "time and power"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When a ray of light inside glass hits its surface at an angle, what happens to the ray when it exits into air?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the ray continues, with no loss power"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the ray reflects"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the ray undergoes total internal reflection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the ray bends, or refracts"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why can fiber optics enable the internet to evolve into a “planetary computer,” where distance doesn’t limit cloud computing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "because a fiber optic carries many channels of data"}, {"label": "B", "text": "because the undersea fiber optic network can wind around the Earth nearly thirty times"}, {"label": "C", "text": "because a fiber optic’s distance weakly limits a channel’s data rate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "because a fiber optic that isn’t bent, won’t let light leak out"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How do integrated photonics help solve the power problems of growing data centers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "integrated photonic chips allow electrical cables between servers to be swapped out for power efficient fiber optics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "integrated photonic chips allow all the devices in a hundred kilometer fiber optic network to be shrunk down into a tiny chip"}, {"label": "C", "text": "integrated photonic chips allow electrical cables between servers to be swapped out for power efficient silicon wires"}, {"label": "D", "text": "integrated photonic chips allow silicon wires to convert electrical signals to light signals, and back"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How will integrated photonics help solve the bandwidth problems of growing wireless demand?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "integrated photonic chips will allow gigahertz wireless signals to be replaced by terahertz wireless signals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "integrated photonic chips will help relay short-range hyperfast data rate wireless signals, via fiber optics, over long-range distances"}, {"label": "C", "text": "integrated photonic chips will be a stable middleman to carry hyperfast wireless signals over long-range distances"}, {"label": "D", "text": "integrated photonic chips will help relieve the absorption of terahertz wireless signals by moisture in the air"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
