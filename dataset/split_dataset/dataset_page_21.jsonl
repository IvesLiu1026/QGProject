The doctor will soon inject its contents \ninto her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer \nusing a PET scanner. The FDG will quickly circulate \nthrough his body. If he has a tumor, cancer cells within it will take up a \nsignificant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon \nfor the scanner. PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools \nin medical diagnostics, and their life begins in \na particle accelerator, just hours earlier. The particle accelerator in question \nis called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker \nwithin hospitals. It uses electromagnetic fields to propel \ncharged particles like protons faster and faster \nalong a spiraling path. When the protons reach \ntheir maximum speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains\na few milliliters of a type of water with a heavy form of oxygen \ncalled oxygen-18. When a proton slams into one of these \nheavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another subatomic particle \ncalled a neutron. This impact turns oxygen-18 \ninto fluorine-18, a radioactive isotope that can be \ndetected on a PET scan. In a little under two hours, about half the fluorine will be gone \ndue to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking \nto get the scan done. So how can fluorine-18 be \nused to detect diseases? Radiochemists at the hospital can use \na series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine \nto different molecules, creating radiotracers. The identity of the tracer depends on what\ndoctors want to observe. FDG is a common one because the rate at \nwhich cells consume glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing brain function of dementia. The FDG is now ready for \nthe patient’s scan. When a radiolabeled tracer \nenters the body, it travels through the circulatory system \nand gets taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain,\ncancer cells, or otherwise. Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has \nfound its way to the target area and the rest has cleared from circulation. Now the doctors can see \ntheir target using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner. The radiation that the tracer emits \nis what makes this possible. The isotopes used in PET decay \nby positron emission. Positrons are essentially electrons \nwith positive charge. When emitted, a positron collides \nwith an electron from another molecule in its surroundings. This causes a tiny nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is \nconverted into two high-energy photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions. These photons will then impact an array of paired radiation detectors \nin the scanner walls. The software in the scanner \nuses those detectors to estimate where inside the body \nthe collision occurred and create a 3D map of the \ntracer’s distribution. PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with \nother types of imaging. They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis\nof Alzheimer’s disease by allowing doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that \notherwise couldn’t be confirmed without an autopsy. Meanwhile, researchers are actively \nworking to develop new tracers and expand the possibilities of what \nPET scans can be used for. But with all this talk of radiation and\nnuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe? Even though no amount of ionizing \nradiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body receives\nduring a PET scan is actually quite low. One scan is comparable to what you’re \nexposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, \nlike radon gas; or the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after \n20 to 30 transatlantic flights. Most patients feel that those risks \nare acceptable for the chance to diagnose \nand treat their illnesses."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the temporal resolution of PET imaging?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A few milliseconds"}], "correct_option": null}, {"question": "Where would you find a PET cyclotron?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In a bunker inside a hospital"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the hospital pharmacy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hundreds of feet underground"}, {"label": "D", "text": "On an airplane"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How large is a PET cyclotron?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10 km in diameter"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100 m in diameter"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3 m in diameter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "0.1 m in diameter"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How long does fluorine-18 last after being produced in a cyclotron?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Minutes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hours"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Days"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Years"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What happens to fluorine-18 after it decays by positron emission?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It disappears by annihilation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It turns into other radioactive isotopes like Uranium-238"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It turns into non-radioactive oxygen-18"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It becomes carbon and hydrogen"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the spatial resolution of PET imaging?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "0.1 micron (e.g., about the size of a virus or a subcellular compartment – 1/10,000,000 of a meter)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10 microns (e.g., about the size of a red blood cell – 1/100,000 of a meter)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "0.1 millimeter (e.g., about the diameter of human hair)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3-5 millimeters (e.g., about the diameter of a small vein or artery)"}, {"label": "E", "text": "10 centimeters (e.g., about the size of the human heart or fist)"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Or should you run, which means you'll be smashing into\nmore raindrops from the side? Assuming you haven't been fully soaked yet\nand you aren't jumping into puddles, the answer is simple. As you move out of the way of one\nfalling raindrop, you move into the way of another. So the amount of rain hitting the\ntop of you is constant, regardless of how fast you're going. Alternatively, you can\npicture that the raindrops themselves are stationary and you (and the earth beneath\nyou) are moving upwards through the rain! And since the volume of a parallelepiped (that's\na 3D parallelogram) doesn't depend at all on its slant, then no matter how fast you're\nmoving horizontally the same amount of rain will land on top of you each second. Now, if you're not moving, the rain from the\ntop is all you'll get. But if you ARE moving, you'll also run into raindrops from the side\nand you'll get wetter. So in any given second, you stay driest by standing still, and the\nfaster you move the wetter you become. But if you're trying to get from point A to\npoint B, then standing still won't do you much good. And en route from point A to point\nB, the total amount of rain you run into from the side has nothing to do with how fast you're\ngoing - just like how a snowplow will plow the same amount of snow from a stretch of\nroad regardless of the exact speed it drives. In the case of running through the rain, you\ncan figure that out using parallelepipeds again. So over a given period of time, the same amount\nof rain will hit you from the top, regardless of how fast you're going. And over a given\ndistance, you'll hit the same amount of rain from the side - again, regardless of how fast\nyou're going. So your total wetness is equal to the wetness\nper second for rain from the top times the amount of time you spend in the rain, plus\nthe wetness per meter for rain from the side times the number of meters you travel. So to stay driest getting from one point to\nanother, you should try to minimize the amount of water falling onto you from above. And\nquite simply, that means getting out of the rain as fast as possible."}, "multiple-choice": []}

It creeps and leaps, it glides and slides. It’s also unstoppable: weapons, fire, extreme temperatures… no matter what you throw at it, it just regrows and continues its rampage. Its expansion is breathtaking; it doubles in size every hour. But there’s one opportunity: after each hour, it goes to sleep, forming itself into a flat triangle and resting for a few minutes before it begins eating and growing again. Your only chance to save the planet involves a satellite-mounted nano-fission\nray that can cut through the blob. When the blog is active it heals itself within seconds. However, when you break the sleeping \nblob into two triangles, you make a critical discovery. The acute triangle portion, with all angles less than 90 degrees, \nis inert. It never “wakes up.” The obtuse triangle, which has an angle greater \nthan 90 degrees, wakes up as usual and keeps growing. Similar experiments show that all shapes \nother than acute triangles, including right triangles, \nwill also wake up. For the next few minutes, the blob is sleeping in its \nobtuse triangle form. You can make clean, straight-line cuts between any two points \non or inside the triangle. But you’ll only have time to make \n7 cuts while the satellite is above you. By the time it completes \nits orbit and returns, the blob will have consumed \nthe entire world, if even a single portion that \nwill wake up remains. How can you cut the blob entirely \ninto acute triangles and stop it from destroying the planet? Pause the video now \nto figure out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 While this seems doable at first, there’s a hidden difficulty when it comes\nto avoiding obtuse and right angles. Every time you make a cut that \nreaches an edge, it either makes an acute and \nan obtuse angle, or two right angles. That makes it seems like you’re doomed\nto keep creating obtuse angles. But as with so many of life’s problems, we can look to pizza for inspiration. Imagine squaring off the \noutside of a pizza, so that instead of a circle, \nit’s an octagon. When we cut it into slices, each of the eight triangles is acute. This works with larger polygons too. Importantly, it also works for some \npolygons with fewer sides, including heptagons, hexagons, \nand pentagons. That’s good news, because if you cut off the sharp corners \nof the blob triangle, a pentagon is exactly what \nyou’ll be left with. And just like a pizza, you can cut the blob pentagon \ninto five acute triangles. That’s 7 cuts, and it renders the \nblob completely inert. You’ve saved the day!

Growing in the misty Sierra Nevada \nmountains, their massive trunks support the \ntallest known trees in the world. But even these behemoths seem \nto have their limits. No sequoia on record has been able \nto grow taller than 130 meters – and many researchers say these \ntrees won’t beat that cap even if they live for thousands of \nyears to come. So what exactly is stopping these trees \nfrom growing taller, forever? It all comes down to sap. In order for trees to grow, they need to bring sugars obtained \nfrom photosynthesis and nutrients brought in through the root \nsystem to wherever growth is happening. And just like blood circulates in \nthe human body, trees are designed to circulate two kinds \nof sap throughout their bodies – carrying all the substances a \ntree’s cells need to live. The first is phloem sap. Containing the sugars generated in \nleaves during photosynthesis, phloem sap is thick, like honey, and flows down the plant’s phloem tissue \nto distribute sugar throughout the tree. By the end of its journey, the phloem sap has thinned \ninto a watery substance, pooling at the base of the tree. Right beside the phloem is the tree’s \nother tissue type: the xylem. This tissue is packed with nutrients and \nions like calcium, potassium, and iron, which the tree has absorbed \nthrough its roots. Here at the tree’s base, there are more of these particles in \none tissue than the other, so the water from the phloem sap is \nabsorbed into the xylem to correct the balance. This process, called osmotic movement, creates nutrient-rich xylem sap, which will then travel up the trunk to \nspread those nutrients through the tree. But this journey faces a formidable \nobstacle: gravity. To accomplish this herculean task, \nthe xylem relies on three forces: transpiration, capillary action, \nand root pressure. As part of photosynthesis, leaves open \nand close pores called stomata. These openings allow oxygen and carbon \ndioxide in and out of the leaf, but they also create an opening through \nwhich water evaporates. This evaporation, called transpiration, creates negative pressure in the xylem, \npulling watery xylem sap up the tree. This pull is aided by a fundamental \nproperty of water called capillary action. In narrow tubes, the attraction between water molecules and the adhesive forces between the water \nand its environment can beat out gravity. This capillary motion is in full effect \nin xylem filaments thinner than human hair. And where these two forces pull the sap, the osmotic movement at the tree’s \nbase creates root pressure, pushing fresh xylem sap up the trunk. Together these forces launch sap \nto dizzying heights, distributing nutrients, and growing new \nleaves to photosynthesize – far above the tree’s roots. But despite these sophisticated systems, every centimeter is a fight \nagainst gravity. As trees grow taller and taller, the supply of these vital fluids \nbegins to dwindle. At a certain height, trees can no longer afford the lost water \nthat evaporates during photosynthesis. And without the photosynthesis needed \nto support additional growth, the tree instead turns its resources \ntowards existing branches. This model, known as the “hydraulic \nlimitation hypothesis,” is currently our best explanation for why \ntrees have limited heights, even in perfect growing conditions. And using this model alongside \ngrowth rates and known needs for nutrients \nand photosynthesis, researchers have been able to propose \nheight limits for specific species. So far these limits have held up – even the world’s tallest tree still falls \nabout fifteen meters below the cap. Researchers are still investigating the \npossible explanations for this limit, and there may not be one universal \nreason why trees stop growing. But until we learn more, the height of trees is yet another\nway that gravity, literally, shapes life on Earth."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Trees’ cells are supplied in sugars and nutrients thanks to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Blood"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sap"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Air"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sunlight"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is particular about the Xylem?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It’s composed of dead cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It’s related to animal neurons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It’s surrounded by a porous layer to deliver chemicals all along the trunk"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It’s has a high photosynthesis activity"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are Stomata?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A specific tissue where the sap flows"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Molecules that play an important role in the ascending movement of the xylem Sap"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A tree species that grows over 100 meters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cells that act like pores and allow gas exchanges at the leaf level."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of these phenomena does NOT contribute to the ascending movement of the xylem sap?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Capillary action"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Root pressure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gravity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Transpiration"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The phloem sap is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yellow"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Salty"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Corrosive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Thick"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

In fact, I'm not very interested\nin parenting, per Se. It's just that there's a certain style\nof parenting these days that is kind of messing up kids, impeding their chances\nto develop into theirselves. There's a certain style\nof parenting these days that's getting in the way. I guess what I'm saying is, we spend a lot of time\nbeing very concerned about parents who aren't involved enough\nin the lives of their kids and their education or their upbringing, and rightly so. But at the other end of the spectrum, there's a lot of harm\ngoing on there as well, where parents feel\na kid can't be successful unless the parent is protecting\nand preventing at every turn and hovering over every happening,\nand micromanaging every moment, and steering their kid towards\nsome small subset of colleges and careers. When we raise kids this way, and I'll say we, because Lord knows,\nin raising my two teenagers, I've had these tendencies myself, our kids end up leading\na kind of checklisted childhood. And here's what the checklisted\nchildhood looks like. We keep them safe and sound and fed and watered, and then we want to be sure\nthey go to the right schools, that they're in the right classes\nat the right schools, and that they get the right grades\nin the right classes in the right schools. But not just the grades, the scores, and not just the grades and scores,\nbut the accolades and the awards and the sports,\nthe activities, the leadership. We tell our kids, don't just join a club, start a club, because colleges\nwant to see that. And check the box for community service. I mean, show the colleges\nyou care about others. (Laughter) And all of this is done to some\nhoped-for degree of perfection. We expect our kids\nto perform at a level of perfection we were never asked\nto perform at ourselves, and so because so much is required, we think, well then, of course we parents\nhave to argue with every teacher and principal and coach and referee and act like our kid's concierge and personal handler and secretary. And then with our kids, our precious kids, we spend so much time nudging, cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling,\nnagging as the case may be, to be sure they're not screwing up, not closing doors, not ruining their future, some hoped-for admission to a tiny handful of colleges that deny almost every applicant. And here's what it feels like\nto be a kid in this checklisted childhood. First of all, there's\nno time for free play. There's no room in the afternoons, because everything\nhas to be enriching, we think. It's as if every piece of homework,\nevery quiz, every activity is a make-or-break moment\nfor this future we have in mind for them, and we absolve them\nof helping out around the house, and we even absolve them\nof getting enough sleep as long as they're checking off\nthe items on their checklist. And in the checklisted childhood,\nwe say we just want them to be happy, but when they come home from school, what we ask about all too often first is their homework and their grades. And they see in our faces that our approval, that our love, that their very worth, comes from A's. And then we walk alongside them and offer clucking praise like a trainer\nat the Westminster Dog Show -- (Laughter) coaxing them to just jump a little higher\nand soar a little farther, day after day after day. And when they get to high school, they don't say, \"Well, what might I\nbe interested in studying or doing as an activity?\" They go to counselors and they say, \"What do I need to do\nto get into the right college?\" And then, when the grades\nstart to roll in in high school, and they're getting some B's, or God forbid some C's, they frantically text their friends and say, \"Has anyone ever gotten\ninto the right college with these grades?\" And our kids, regardless of where they end up\nat the end of high school, they're breathless. They're brittle. They're a little burned out. They're a little old before their time, wishing the grown-ups in their lives\nhad said, \"What you've done is enough, this effort you've put forth\nin childhood is enough.\" And they're withering now\nunder high rates of anxiety and depression and some of them are wondering, will this life ever turn out\nto have been worth it? Well, we parents, we parents are pretty sure\nit's all worth it. We seem to behave -- it's like we literally think\nthey will have no future if they don't get into one of these\ntiny set of colleges or careers we have in mind for them. Or maybe, maybe, we're just afraid they won't have a future we can brag about to our friends and with stickers\non the backs of our cars. Yeah. (Applause) But if you look at what we've done, if you have the courage\nto really look at it, you'll see that not only do our kids\nthink their worth comes from grades and scores, but that when we live right up inside\ntheir precious developing minds all the time, like our very own version\nof the movie \"Being John Malkovich,\" we send our children the message: \"Hey kid, I don't think you can actually\nachieve any of this without me.\" And so with our overhelp, our overprotection\nand overdirection and hand-holding, we deprive our kids\nof the chance to build self-efficacy, which is a really fundamental tenet\nof the human psyche, far more important\nthan that self-esteem they get every time we applaud. Self-efficacy is built when one sees\nthat one's own actions lead to outcomes, not -- There you go. (Applause) Not one's parents'\nactions on one's behalf, but when one's own actions\nlead to outcomes. So simply put, if our children are to develop\nself-efficacy, and they must, then they have to do a whole lot more\nof the thinking, planning, deciding, doing, hoping, coping, trial and error, dreaming and experiencing of life for themselves. Now, am I saying every kid is hard-working and motivated and doesn't need a parent's involvement\nor interest in their lives, and we should just back off and let go? Hell no. (Laughter) That is not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is, when we treat\ngrades and scores and accolades and awards as the purpose of childhood, all in furtherance of some hoped-for\nadmission to a tiny number of colleges or entrance to a small number of careers, that that's too narrow a definition\nof success for our kids. And even though we might help them\nachieve some short-term wins by overhelping -- like they get a better grade\nif we help them do their homework, they might end up with a longer\nchildhood résumé when we help -- what I'm saying is that all of this\ncomes at a long-term cost to their sense of self. What I'm saying is,\nwe should be less concerned with the specific set of colleges they might be able\nto apply to or might get into and far more concerned that they have\nthe habits, the mindset, the skill set, the wellness, to be successful\nwherever they go. What I'm saying is, our kids need us to be a little\nless obsessed with grades and scores and a whole lot more interested in childhood providing\na foundation for their success built on things like love and chores. (Laughter) (Applause) Did I just say chores?\nDid I just say chores? I really did. But really, here's why. The longest longitudinal study\nof humans ever conducted is called the Harvard Grant Study. It found that professional\nsuccess in life, which is what we want for our kids, that professional success in life\ncomes from having done chores as a kid, and the earlier you started, the better, that a roll-up-your-sleeves-\nand-pitch-in mindset, a mindset that says,\nthere's some unpleasant work, someone's got to do it,\nit might as well be me, a mindset that says, I will contribute my effort\nto the betterment of the whole, that that's what gets you ahead\nin the workplace. Now, we all know this. You know this. (Applause) We all know this, and yet,\nin the checklisted childhood, we absolve our kids of doing\nthe work of chores around the house, and then they end up\nas young adults in the workplace still waiting for a checklist, but it doesn't exist, and more importantly,\nlacking the impulse, the instinct to roll up their sleeves and pitch in and look around and wonder,\nhow can I be useful to my colleagues? How can I anticipate a few steps ahead\nto what my boss might need? A second very important finding\nfrom the Harvard Grant Study said that happiness in life comes from love, not love of work, love of humans: our spouse, our partner,\nour friends, our family. So childhood needs to teach\nour kids how to love, and they can't love others\nif they don't first love themselves, and they won't love themselves\nif we can't offer them unconditional love. (Applause) Right. And so, instead of being obsessed\nwith grades and scores when our precious offspring\ncome home from school, or we come home from work, we need to close our technology,\nput away our phones, and look them in the eye and let them see\nthe joy that fills our faces when we see our child\nfor the first time in a few hours. And then we have to say, \"How was your day? What did you like about today?\" And when your teenage daughter\nsays, \"Lunch,\" like mine did, and I want to hear about the math test, not lunch, you have to still\ntake an interest in lunch. You gotta say, \"What was great\nabout lunch today?\" They need to know\nthey matter to us as humans, not because of their GPA. All right, so you're thinking,\nchores and love, that sounds all well and good,\nbut give me a break. The colleges want to see\ntop scores and grades and accolades and awards,\nand I'm going to tell you, sort of. The very biggest brand-name schools\nare asking that of our young adults, but here's the good news. Contrary to what the college\nrankings racket would have us believe -- (Applause) you don't have to go to one\nof the biggest brand name schools to be happy and successful in life. Happy and successful people\nwent to state school, went to a small college\nno one has heard of, went to community college, went to a college over here\nand flunked out. (Applause) The evidence is in this room,\nis in our communities, that this is the truth. And if we could widen our blinders and be willing to look\nat a few more colleges, maybe remove our own egos\nfrom the equation, we could accept and embrace\nthis truth and then realize, it is hardly the end of the world if our kids don't go to one\nof those big brand-name schools. And more importantly, if their childhood has not been lived\naccording to a tyrannical checklist then when they get to college, whichever one it is, well, they'll have gone there\non their own volition, fueled by their own desire, capable and ready to thrive there. I have to admit something to you. I've got two kids I mentioned,\nSawyer and Avery. They're teenagers. And once upon a time, I think I was treating my Sawyer and Avery like little bonsai trees -- (Laughter) that I was going\nto carefully clip and prune and shape into some perfect\nform of a human that might just be perfect enough\nto warrant them admission to one of the most\nhighly selective colleges. But I've come to realize, after working\nwith thousands of other people's kids -- (Laughter) and raising two kids of my own, my kids aren't bonsai trees.

{"page": 21, "lesson": 7, "title": "The physics of surfing - Nick Pizzo", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-physics-of-surfing-nick-pizzo", "transcript": {"en": "Whether or not you realize it, as a surfer you’re a master \nof complicated physics. The science of surfing begins as soon as you and your board \nfirst hit the water. The board’s size and light construction \nhelp it displace a lot of water. In turn, a buoyant force equal to the weight of the \ndisplaced water pushes up, counteracting you and your board’s weight. This lets you stay afloat while \nyou wait to paddle for a wave. And what exactly are you waiting for? The perfect wave, of course. Like other waves in physics, ocean waves\nrepresent a transfer of energy. Wind blowing across the ocean accelerates \nwater particles near the surface, leading to the growth of ripples \nthat become waves. These deviations from the flat surface \nare acted upon by gravity, which tries to restore the surface \nto its original flat state. As the waves then move through the water, particles push and pull on their neighbors\nthrough the wave induced pressure, and this motion propagates energy through \nthe water in unison with the wave motion. The motion of these particles is much more limited than the \noverall motion of the waves. Near the shore, the shallower seafloor constrains \nthe motion of the waves to occur in a more limited region \nthan out at sea, concentrating the wave energy \nnear the surface. If the topography of the shoreline \nis even and smooth, this will refract the waves \nto become more parallel to the shore as they approach. This is the crucial moment. As the wave gets near, you quickly pivot your board \nin the same direction as the wave and paddle to match its speed. Your board forms an angle with the water, and this creates a dynamic pressure \non the bottom of it, forcing you and your board \nout of the water, to skim along the surface. At the same time, your increased forward momentum \nmakes you more stable, allowing you to stand up \nand surf along the wave. Now you’ve caught the wave, and are riding along its front \nface parallel to the shoreline. Fins on the surfboard allow you to alter \nyour speed and direction by repositioning your weight. Above you is the wave’s crest, where the water particles are undergoing\ntheir greatest acceleration. That forces them to move faster \nthan the underlying wave, so they shoot ahead before falling under\ngravity’s influence. This forms the waves’ characteristic\ncurls, or jets, as they break along the shore. Sometimes, the curl might completely \nenclose part of the wave, forming a moving tube of water \nknown as the barrel. Because of irregularities in the seafloor \nand the swell itself, few barrels last as long as the legendary \n27-second ride off the coast of Namibia. But many who manage to get barreled have said they feel time \npassing differently inside, making it one of the most magical \nexperiences a surfer can have. Of course, not all beaches are created equal. Offshore underwater canyons or rock\nformations in certain locations like Nazare, Portugal\nor Mavericks, California refract the incoming wave energy \ninto a single spot, creating massive waves \nsought by surfers worldwide. And some of these waves travel \nfor more than a week, with swells originating more than 10,000 \nkilometers away from shore. Waves surfed in sunny California may have originated in the stormy \nseas near New Zealand. So while you may not be thinking about \nweather patterns in the South Pacific, tectonic geology, or fluid mechanics, the art of catching the perfect wave \nrelies on all these things and more. And the waves we surf, created by wind, are just one visible part of the \ncontinuous oscillation of energy that has shaped our universe \nsince its very beginning."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where is the water near a breaking wave moving fastest?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Near the crest"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Near the middle of the wave"}, {"label": "C", "text": "At the bottom"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Behind the wave"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What creates the waves we usually surf?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tides"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The wind"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The amount of salt in the water"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Passing boats"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is important for making waves big in one location versus another?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The water temperature"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The proximity to the equator"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The shape of the bottom of the ocean, or bathymetry"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The color of the water"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When waves travel across the ocean, they transport", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Energy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mass"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Waves get larger as they approach the shore because", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are slowing down"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are speeding up"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are reflecting off the shore"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are getting warmer"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 21, "lesson": 8, "title": "How to connect with depressed friends - Bill Bernat", "category": "Emotional Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/rVB5Pj1P", "transcript": {"en": "The one conversation that uplifted me\nmore than any other in my life was with a woman who told me how, a few days earlier, she drove her Jeep Wrangler\nto the edge of the Grand Canyon and sat there, revving the engine, thinking about driving over. Even though I had severe social anxiety, in that conversation,\nI was totally at ease. (Laughter) She told me what was going on in her life in the days and months leading up, what her thoughts were\nat that exact moment, why she wanted to die, and why she didn't do it. We nodded and half-smiled, and then it was my turn\nto talk about my journey to a dining table\nin the hygienic community area of the mental health wing\nof a mountain-town hospital. I took too many sleeping pills, and after they treated me for that, they were like, \"Hey, we would love it\nif you would be our guest in the psych ward.\" (Laughter) We joked that her suicide\nwould have made a way better postcard. (Laughter) We talked shop. (Laughter) She allowed me to be deeply depressed and have a genuine connection\nto another person, simultaneously. For the first time, I identified as somebody\nliving with depression, and I felt good about it -- like I wasn't a bad person for it. Now imagine one of the people\nat that table was a member of your family or a close friend. Would you be comfortable talking to them? What if instead of the hospital, they were at your kitchen table and told you they were really depressed? The World Health Organization says that depression is the leading cause\nof ill health and disability worldwide, affecting 350 million people. The National Institute of Mental Health reports seven percent of Americans\nexperiencing depression in a year. So depression is super common, yet in my experience, most folks don't want\nto talk to depressed people unless we pretend to be happy. A cheerful facade is appropriate\nfor casual interactions. A depressed person can ask for extra syrup\nin their pumpkin spice latte without explaining that they need it because they're trapped\nin the infinite darkness of their soul and they've lost all hope of escape -- (Laughter) again. (Laughter) Depression doesn't diminish\na person's desire to connect with other people, just their ability. So in spite of what you might think, talking to friends and family\nliving with depression can be really easy and maybe even fun. Not, like, Facebook-selfie-with-Lady-Gaga-\nat-an-underground-party fun -- I'm talking about the kind of fun where people enjoy\neach other's company effortlessly. Nobody feels awkward, and no one accuses the sad person\nof ruining the holidays. Why does this chasm even exist? On the one side, you have people living with depression who may act in off-putting\nor confusing ways because they're fighting\na war in their head that nobody else can see. On the other side, the vast majority of people\nlook across the chasm and shake their heads, like, \"Why you gotta be so depressed?\" You may recognize\na divide like this in your life. Do you want to build a bridge across it? You may not want to build a bridge -- and that's a totally valid choice. Or maybe you'd like to build\na stronger connection, but you have a lot\nof questions and concerns. You're what I might call \"bridge curious.\" (Laughter) Here are some possible reasons why some of you\nmay avoid depressed people. You might be afraid that if you talk to somebody\nwhile they're depressed, you're suddenly responsible\nfor their well-being. You're not expected to be Dr. Phil. Just be friendly -- more like Ellen. (Laughter) You may worry that you won't\nknow what to say, and every attempt\nat conversation will be awkward, and the only time you'll feel comfortable is when you both just give up on talking and stare at your phones. Words are not the most important\nthing to focus on. You might fear seeing your shadow. Hey, if you have been\nsuccessfully outrunning your personal emotional demons, that's awesome. May the wind be at your back. (Laughter) You can be the least\nwoo-woo person in the world and still connect with depressed people. Maybe you've heard\nthat depression is contagious, and you're afraid of catching it. Bring some hand sanitizer. (Laughter) You're much more likely to catch\nthe joy of human bonding. Maybe you see\ndepressed people differently. You think of them as flawed or defective. Multiple university studies have shown that A students are more likely\nto have bipolar condition. Our brains aren't broken or damaged, they just work differently. I spent a lot of years thinking\nhappy people just don't get it. (Laughter) I did eventually stop\ndiscriminating against happy people -- (Laughter) I began battling depression\nwhen I was eight, and decades later, to my surprise, I started winning. I shifted from being miserable\nmuch of the time to enjoying life. I live pretty well\nwith my bipolar condition, and I've overcome some other\nmental health conditions like overeating, addiction\nand social anxiety. So I live on both sides of this chasm. And I'm offering some guidance based on my experience to help you build a bridge across it if you want to. It's not hard science, but I worked with a lot people\nI know who've lived with depression to refine these suggestions. First up, some things\nyou might want to avoid -- some \"don'ts.\" One of the most off-putting\nthings you can say is, \"Just get over it.\" Great idea -- love it, it's just we already thought of that. (Laughter) The absence of the ability\nto just get over it is depression. (Laughter) (Applause) We feel it in our bodies -- it's a physical thing for us. And medically it's no different from telling someone\nwith a broken ankle or cancer, \"just get over it.\" Don't be hell-bent on fixing us. Like, thank you, but ... the pressure can make us depressed people\nfeel like we're disappointing you. Also, things that make\nsome people feel better may not work for us. You can't cure clinical depression\nby getting ice cream ... which is unfortunate, because\nthat would be living the dream. (Laughter) Don't take a negative response personally. So, I have a friend who, about a year ago, messaged me that he was really\nisolated and depressed. And I suggested some things for him to do, and he was like, \"No, no and no.\" And I got mad, like, how dare he not embrace\nmy brilliant wisdom? (Laughter) And then I remembered\ntimes I've been depressed, and how I thought I was doomed\nin all possible futures, or everybody suddenly hated me,\nand things like that. It didn't matter how many people\ntold me otherwise -- I didn't believe them. So I let my friend know I cared, and I didn't take it personally. Don't let a lack of bubbly\nhappiness freak you out. It's not a shark attack. \"Call the coast guard, my friend is sad!\" (Laughter) We can be sad and OK at the same time. I'm going to say that again, because in our society,\nwe're taught the opposite, and so it's counterintuitive. People can be sad and OK at the same time. So some of these things may apply\nto you personally, some may not. Take what's useful. And remember, you don't have to connect. If you want to, here are some suggestions that may help -- some \"dos.\" Talk to us in your natural voice, right? (Laughter) You don't need to put on a sad voice\nbecause we're depressed -- you don't sneeze when you're talking\nto somebody with a cold. (Laughter) It's not rude to be upbeat. You can be you, OK? If you make an offer to be there for us, clearly state what you can and can't do. I have told people,\n\"Hey, call or text any time, but I might not be able\nto get back to you that same day.\" It's totally cool to not make an offer, or to make a narrow offer\nwith really clear boundaries around it. Give us a sense of control. Like, get our consent. I have a friend who, a while back, when I was having a depressive episode, reached out and said,\n\"Hey, I want to check in with you. Can I call you every day? Maybe text you every day\nand call later in the week? What works for you?\" By getting my permission,\nshe earned my complete confidence and remains one of my best friends today. And my last suggestion is: interact about not depression, aka, normal stuff. I have a friend who,\nwhen people were worried about him, they would call and ask\nif he wanted to go shopping or help them clean out their garage. Your depressed friends\ncould be a good source of free labor -- (Laughter) What I'm really getting at is, invite them to contribute\nto your life in some way, even if it's as small\nas asking you to go see a movie that you wanted to see in the theater. So that's a lot\nof dos and don'ts and maybes, and it's not by any means\na definitive list. The thing to remember\nis that they're all grounded in one guiding principle. It's what allowed the woman\nin the Jeep Wrangler to start me on the path to recovery\nwithout even trying. She talked to me like I belonged and contributed exactly as I was\nat that moment. If you talk to a depressed person\nas if their life is just as valuable, intense and beautiful as yours, then there's no need\nto build a bridge between you, because you've closed the chasm. Focus on that instead of your words, and it may be the most uplifting\nconversation of their life. What could that do\nfor somebody you care about? What could it do for you? Thank you.

Although she considered other careers, Plath chose the artist’s way. Poetry was her calling. Under her shrewd eye and pen, everyday objects became haunting images: a “new statue in a drafty museum,” a shadow in a mirror, a slab of soap. Fiercely intelligent, \npenetrating and witty, Plath was also diagnosed \nwith clinical depression. She used poetry to explore her own states \nof mind in the most intimate terms, and her breathtaking perspectives \non emotion, nature and art continue \nto captivate and resonate. In her first collection of poems, \"The Colossus,\" she wrote of a feeling of nothingness: \"white: it is a complexion of the mind.” At the same time, she found solace in nature, from “a blue mist” “dragging the lake,” to white flowers that “tower and topple,” to blue mussels “clumped like bulbs.” After \"The Colossus\" she \npublished \"The Bell Jar,\" her only novel, which fictionalizes the time she spent \nworking for Mademoiselle magazine in New York during college. The novel follows its heroine, Esther, as she slides into a severe \ndepressive episode, but also includes wickedly funny and \nshrewd depictions of snobby fashion parties \nand dates with dull men. Shortly after the publication \nof \"The Bell Jar,\" Plath died by suicide at age 30. Two years later, the collection of poems\nshe wrote in a burst of creative energy during the months before her death was published under the title \"Ariel.\" Widely considered her masterpiece, Ariel exemplifies the honesty \nand imagination Plath harnessed to capture her pain. In one of \"Ariel's\" most forceful poems, \"Lady Lazarus,\" she explores her attempts \nto take her own life through Lazarus, the biblical figure who rose \nfrom the dead. She writes, “and I a smiling woman/\nI am only thirty/ And like the cat I have\nnine times to die.” But the poem is also a testament \nto survival: “I rise with my red hair/\nAnd I eat men like air.” This unflinching language has made Plath \nan important touchstone for countless other readers and writers who sought to break the silence surrounding issues of trauma, \nfrustration, and sexuality. \"Ariel\" is also filled with moving \nmeditations on heartbreak and creativity. The title poem begins “Stasis in darkness/ Then the substanceless blue/\nPour of tor and distances.” This sets the scene for a naked ride \non horseback in the early morning— one of Plath’s most memorable expressions\nof the elation of creative freedom. But it is also full of foreboding \nimagery, such as “a child's cry” that “melts \nin the wall” and a “red/eye, the cauldron \nof morning.” This darkness is echoed throughout \nthe collection, which includes controversial references \nto the holocaust and the Kamikazes. Even the relics of seemingly happier times\nare described as crucifying the author: “My husband and child smiling out \nof the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, \nlittle smiling hooks.” Her domestic dissatisfaction and her \nhusband’s mistreatment of her are constant themes in her later poetry. After her death, he inherited her estate, and has been accused of excluding \nsome of her work from publication. Despite these possible omissions \nand her untimely death, what survives is one of the most \nextraordinary bodies of work by a twentieth century poet. While her work can be shocking in \nits rage and trauma, Plath casts her readers as witnesses– not only to the truth of her \npsychological life, but to her astounding ability to express \nwhat often remains inexpressible."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The famous fig tree scene from The Bell Jar describes, in metaphoric terms:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A sense of being immobilized by indecision"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The protagonist’s hunger"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A feeling of heartbreak"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Sylvia Plath’s only novel is titled", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Fig Tree"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Bell Jar"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Colossus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ariel"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Sylvia Plath was diagnosed with depression, and used her poetry to explore and express difficult states of mind", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In her poetry, Plath often describes finding solace in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Her marriage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Books"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Family"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nature"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 21, "lesson": 10, "title": "How does the Rorschach inkblot test work? - Damion Searls", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-does-the-rorschach-inkblot-test-work-damion-searls", "transcript": {"en": "Take a look at this image. What might this be? A frightening monster? Two friendly bears? Or something else entirely? For nearly a century, ten inkblots like these have been used as what seems like an almost \nmystical personality test. Long kept confidential for psychologists \nand their patients, the mysterious images were said to draw\nout the workings of a person’s mind. But what can inkblots really tell us, and how does this test work? Invented in the early 20th century \nby Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach, the Rorschach Test is actually less about \nthe specific things we see, and more about our general approach \nto perception. As an amateur artist Hermann was fascinated by how visual \nperception varies from person to person. He carried this interest to \nmedical school, where he learned all our senses \nare deeply connected. He studied how our process of perception \ndoesn’t just register sensory inputs, but transforms them. And when he started working at a \nmental hospital in eastern Switzerland, he began designing a series \nof puzzling images to gain new insight into this \nenigmatic process. Using his inkblot paintings, Rorschach began quizzing hundreds \nof healthy subjects and psychiatric patients with \nthe same question: what might this be? However, it wasn’t what the test subjects \nsaw that was most important to Rorschach, but rather, how they approached the task. Which parts of the image did they \nfocus on or ignore? Did they see the image moving? Did the color on some inkblots help them \ngive better answers, or distract and overwhelm them? He developed a system to code \npeople’s responses, reducing the wide range of interpretations\nto a few manageable numbers. Now he had empirical measures to quantify \nall kinds of test takers: the creative and imaginative, the detail-oriented, the \nbig-picture perceivers, and flexible participants able \nto adapt their approach. Some people would get stuck, offering the same answer \nfor multiple blots. Others gave unusual and \ndelightful descriptions. Responses were as varied as the inkblots, which offered different kinds of \nperceptual problems– some easier to interpret than others. But analyzing the test-taker’s \noverall approach yielded real insights into \ntheir psychology. And as Rorschach tested more \nand more people, patterns began to pile up. Healthy subjects with the same \npersonalities often took remarkably similar approaches. Patients suffering from the same \nmental illnesses also performed similarly, making the test a reliable \ndiagnostic tool. It could even diagnose some conditions difficult to pinpoint with other \navailable methods. In 1921, Rorschach published his coding system \nalongside the ten blots he felt gave the most nuanced picture of people’s\nperceptual approach. Over the next several decades, the test became wildly popular in \ncountries around the world. By the 1960s, it had been officially administered \nmillions of times in the U.S. alone. Unfortunately, less than a year after \npublishing the test, Hermann Rorschach had died suddenly. Without its inventor to keep it on track, the test he had methodically gathered \nso much data to support began to be used in all sorts \nof speculative ways. Researchers gave the test \nto Nazi war criminals, hoping to unlock the psychological roots \nof mass murder. Anthropologists showed the images to \nremote communities as a sort of universal personality test. Employers made prejudiced hiring decisions\nbased on reductive decoding charts. As the test left clinics and entered \npopular culture its reputation among medical \nprofessionals plummeted, and the blots began to fall \nout of clinical use. Today, the test is still controversial, and many people assume \nit has been disproven. But a massive 2013 review of all the \nexisting Rorschach research showed that when administered properly \nthe test yields valid results, which can help diagnose mental illness or round out a patient’s \npsychological profile. It’s hardly a stand-alone key \nto the human mind– no test is. But its visual approach and lack \nof any single right answer continue to help psychologists paint\na more nuanced picture of how people see the world.

I've received hate online. A lot of it. And it comes\nwith the territory of my work. I'm a digital creator, I make things specifically\nfor the internet. Like, a few years ago, I made\na video series called \"Every Single Word\" where I edited down popular films to only the words\nspoken by people of color, as a way to empirically and accessibly\ntalk about the issue of representation in Hollywood. Then, later, as transphobic bathroom bill started gaining media attention\naround the United States, I hosted and produced an interview series called \"Sitting in Bathrooms\nwith Trans People\" where I did exactly that. (Laughter) And then -- Sure, I'll take applause. (Applause) Thank you. And then, are you familiar\nwith those unboxing videos on YouTube where YouTubers open up\nthe latest electronic gadgets? Great, so I satirized those\nin a weekly series, where instead I unboxed\nintangible ideologies like police brutality, masculinity\nand the mistreatment of Native Americans. (Laughter) My work -- Thanks. One person applauding, God bless. (Laughter) Mom, hi. (Laughter) So, my work became popular. Very popular. I got millions of views,\na ton of great press and a slew of new followers. But the flip side of success\non the internet is internet hate. I was called everything. From \"beta\" to \"snowflake\"\nand, of course, the ever-popular \"cuck.\" Don't worry, I will break\nthese terms down for you. (Laughter) So, \"beta,\" for those of you unfamiliar, is shorthand online lingo for \"beta male.\" But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings and my fashion aesthetic\nis rich-white-woman-running-errands, so I'm not angling to be an alpha. (Applause) Doesn't totally work. (Laughter) Now, \"snowflake\" is a put-down\nfor people who are sensitive and believe themselves to be unique, and I'm a millennial\nand an only child, so, duh! (Laughter) But my favorite, favorite,\nfavorite is \"cuck.\" It's a slur, short for \"cuckold,\" for men who have been\ncheated on by their wives. But friends, I am so gay, that if I had a wife, I would\nencourage her to cheat on me. (Laughter) Thank you. Let's take a look at some\nof this negativity in action. Sometimes it's direct. Like Marcos, who wrote, \"You're everything I hate\nin a human being.\" Thank you, Marcos. Others are more concise. Like Donovan, who wrote,\n\"gaywad fagggggg.\" Now, I do need to point out,\nDonovan is not wrong, OK? In fact, he's right on both counts,\nso credit where credit is due. Thank you, Donovan. Others write to me with questions,\nlike Brian, who asked, \"Were you born a bitch or did you\njust learn to be one over time?\" But my favorite thing about this is that once Brian was done typing,\nhis finger must have slipped because then he sent me\nthe thumbs-up emoji. (Laughter) So, babe, thumbs up to you, too. (Laughter) It's fun to talk about these messages now. Right? And it's cathartic to laugh at them. But I can tell you that it really\ndoes not feel good to receive them. At first, I would screenshot\ntheir comments and make fun of their typos, but this soon felt elitist\nand ultimately unhelpful. So over time, I developed\nan unexpected coping mechanism. Because most of these messages I received\nwere through social media, I could often click on the profile picture\nof the person who sent them and learn everything about them. I could see pictures they were tagged in, posts they'd written, memes they'd shared, and somehow, seeing that it was\na human on the other side of the screen made me feel a little better. Not to justify what they wrote, right? But just to provide context. Still, that didn't feel like enough. So, I called some of them -- only the ones I felt safe talking to -- with a simple opening question: \"Why did you write that?\" The first person I spoke to was Josh. He had written to tell me\nthat I was a moron, I was a reason this country\nwas dividing itself, and he added at the end\nthat being gay was a sin. I was so nervous\nfor our first conversation. This wasn't a comments section. So I couldn't use tools\nlike muting or blocking. Of course, I guess,\nI could have hung up on him. But I didn't want to. Because I liked talking to him. Because I liked him. Here's a clip of one of our conversations. (Audio) Dylan Marron: Josh, you said you're about to graduate\nhigh school, right? Josh: Mmm-hmm. DM: How is high school for you? Josh: Am I allowed to use\nthe H-E-double-hockey-stick word? DM: Oh, yeah. You're allowed to. Josh: It was hell. DM: Really? Josh: And it's still hell right now,\neven though it's only two weeks left. I'm a little bit bigger --\nI don't like to use the word \"fat,\" but I am a little bit bigger\nthan a lot of my classmates and they seem to judge me\nbefore they even got to know me. DM: That's awful. I mean, I also just want\nto let you know, Josh, I was bullied in high school, too. So did our common ground\nof being bullied in high school erase what he wrote me? No. And did our single phone conversation radically heal a politically\ndivided country and cure systemic injustice? No, absolutely not, right? But did our conversation\nhumanize us to each other more than profile pictures\nand posts ever could? Absolutely. I didn't stop there. Because some of the hate I received\nwas from \"my side.\" So when Matthew,\na queer liberal artist like me publicly wrote that I represented\nsome of the worst aspects of liberalism, I wanted to ask him this. DM: You tagged me in this post. Did you want me to see it? Matthew (Laughing): I honestly\ndidn't think that you would. DM: Have you ever been publicly dragged? Matthew: I have been. And I just said, \"No, I don't care.\" DM: And did you not care? Matthew: But it was hard. DM: Did you not care? Matthew: Oh, I cared, yes. DM: At the end of these conversations, there's often a moment of reflection. A reconsideration. And that's exactly what happened at the end of my call\nwith a guy named Doug who had written that I was\na talentless propaganda hack. (Audio) Did the conversation\nwe just had -- does it, like, make you feel differently\nabout how you write online? Doug: Yeah! You know,\nwhen I said this to you, when I said you were a \"talentless hack,\" I had never conversed\nwith you in my life, really. I didn't really know anything\nreally about you. And I think that a lot of times, that's what the comment\nsections really are, it's really a way to get\nyour anger at the world out on random profiles\nof strangers, pretty much. DM (Laughing): Yeah, right. Doug: But it definitely\nhas made me rethink the way that I interact\nwith people online. DM: So I've collected these\nconversations and many others for my podcast \"Conversations\nwith People Who Hate Me.\" (Laughter) Before I started this project, I thought that the real way\nto bring about change was to shut down opposing viewpoints through epically worded\nvideo essays and comments and posts, but I soon learned\nthose were only cheered on by the people who already agreed with me. Sometimes -- bless you. Sometimes, the most subversive\nthing you could do -- yeah, clap for him. (Laughter) Sometimes, the most subversive\nthing you could do was to actually speak\nwith the people you disagreed with, and not simply at them. Now in every one of my calls, I always ask my guests\nto tell me about themselves. And it's their answer to this question\nthat allows me to empathize with them. And empathy, it turns out, is a key ingredient in getting\nthese conversations off the ground, but it can feel very vulnerable to be empathizing with someone\nyou profoundly disagree with. So I established\na helpful mantra for myself. Empathy is not endorsement. Empathizing with someone\nyou profoundly disagree with does not suddenly compromise\nyour own deeply held beliefs and endorse theirs. Empathizing with someone who, for example,\nbelieves that being gay is a sin doesn't mean that I'm suddenly\ngoing to drop everything, pack my bags and grab\nmy one-way ticket to hell, right? It just means that I'm acknowledging the humanity of someone who was raised\nto think very differently from me. I also want to be super clear\nabout something. This is not a prescription for activism. I understand that\nsome people don't feel safe talking to their detractors and others feel so marginalized that they justifiably don't feel\nthat they have any empathy to give. I totally get that. This is just what I feel\nwell-suited to do. You know, I've reached out\nto a lot of people for this podcast. And some have politely declined, others have read my message\nand ignored it, some have blocked me automatically\nwhen I sent the invitation and one guy actually agreed to do it and then, five minutes into the call, hung up on me. I'm also aware that this talk\nwill appear on the internet. And with the internet comes\ncomment sections, and with comment sections\ninevitably comes hate. So as you are watching this talk, you can feel free to call me\nwhatever you'd like. You can call me a \"gaywad,\"\na \"snowflake,\" a \"cuck,\" a \"beta,\" or \"everything wrong with liberalism.\" But just know that if you do,\nI may ask you to talk. And if you refuse\nor block me automatically or agree and hang up on me, then maybe, babe, the snowflake is you. Thank you so much. (Applause) (Cheering) (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Now, you’ll need to use that timing \nto help you break out of jail. At the appointed time, you’ll be walking \nin the yard near the electric fence. Your partner will flash you the signal, and exactly 45 seconds later, short out the fence circuit. It’ll automatically restart \nafter a second or two, but as long as you move fast, you’ll be home free. And then you notice, to your horror, that your watch is broken, and there’s no time to fix it. The signal is coming, and if you make even a small mistake \nin counting off 45 seconds, you’ll get fried. Searching your pockets, you find something that might help: a lighter and two fuses you made earlier \nin the prison work program. Each fuse is a length of flammable twine, built to be lit on either end \nand burn for precisely one minute. The problem is that even though \nthe fuses look uniform, they don’t burn evenly, so if you cut one in half, for example, one side might burn longer than the other. Your partner is going to give \nthe signal any minute, and you’ll have to make your move. How can you use the fuses and lighter \nto time exactly 45 seconds? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The length of the fuse may \nnot tell you anything, but you do know the fuses take exactly\n60 seconds to burn from end to end. Here’s the key insight: If you start a fuse on one side \nand it burns for 30 seconds, there’ll still be 30 seconds of fuse left. If you had started it from the other end, it would’ve reached the exact \nsame spot in thirty seconds. That means that if you lit it \nfrom both ends simultaneously, it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds. But how will you time the last fifteen? That’ll have to come from the second fuse. If it were a 30 second fuse, you’d be able to use that same trick again to double the burning speed and \nmake it last exactly 15 seconds. And, you realize, you can \nshorten the second fuse by lighting one end of it at the same time\nas you light the first. At the moment the first burns out, you’ll be left with 30 seconds \non the second fuse. Just when you’ve got this all figured out, you see the signal from your partner, and spring into action. You gather the four ends of the two \nfuses and light three of them. The moment the first burns out, you light the other end \nof the second fuse. When it flickers and dies, you know that exactly 45 \nseconds have passed, and the electric fence is dead. By the time it hiccups back to life, you’re over the fence and home free."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How long does a single fuse burn?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "30 seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "45 seconds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 minute"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2 minutes"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How long after the signal flashes will the electric fence short out?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "30 seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "45 seconds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 minute"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2 minutes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If you cut a fuse in half, how long will it burn?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "30 seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "45 seconds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 minute"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No way to know exactly how long"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "If you burn the fuse from both ends, how long will it burn?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "30 seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "45 seconds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 minute"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No way to know exactly how long"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How long does the second fuse burn in all in the final answer?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "30 seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "45 seconds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 minute"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No way to know exactly how long"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

I loved our neighborhood. It was lively. There was all this merengue blasting, neighbors socializing on building stoops and animated conversations\nover domino playing. It was home, and it was sweet. But it wasn't simple. In fact, everyone at school\nknew the block where we lived, because it was where people came\nto buy weed and other drugs. And with drug-dealing comes conflict, so we often went to sleep\nto the sound of gunshots. I spent much of my childhood worried, worried about our safety. And so did our mother. She worried that the violence we witnessed\nwould overtake our lives; that our poverty meant that the neighbors with whom\nwe lived and shared space would harm us. Our entire life was in the Bronx, but my mother's anxiety\nspurred her into action, and soon we were driving\nso fast to Connecticut -- (Laughter) to boarding school campuses,\nwith full scholarships in tow. Man, don't underestimate\nthe power of a mother determined to keep her children safe. (Cheers) (Applause) At boarding school, for the first time, I was able to sleep without worry. I could leave my dorm room unlocked, walk barefoot in the grass, and look up to see\na night sky full of stars. Happy novelties. But there were other novelties as well. Very quickly, I felt like I didn't belong. I learned that I didn't speak\nthe right way, and to demonstrate\nthe proper ways of speaking, my teachers gave me\nfrequent lessons, in public, on the appropriate way\nto enunciate certain words. A teacher once instructed me\nin the hallway: \"Aaaaaas-king.\" She said this loudly. \"Dena, it's not 'axing,'\nlike you're running around with an axe. That's silly.\" Now at this point, you can imagine\nthe snickers of my classmates, but she continued: \"Think about breaking the word\ninto 'ass' and 'king,' and then put the two together\nto say it correctly -- 'Asking.'\" There were some other moments\nthat reminded me that I didn't belong. Once, I walked into\na classmate's dorm room, and I watched her watch\nher valuables around me. Like, why would she do that?\nI thought to myself. And then there was the time when another classmate\nwalked into my dorm room, and yelled, \"Ew!\" as I was applying\nhair grease to my scalp. There is emotional damage done\nwhen young people can't be themselves, when they are forced to edit who they are\nin order to be acceptable. It's a kind of violence. Ultimately, I'm a quintessential\nsuccess story. I attended boarding school\nand college in New England, studied abroad in Chile and returned to the Bronx\nto be a middle school teacher. I received a Truman Scholarship, a Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship. And I could list more. (Laughter) But I won't. (Laughter) I earned my doctorate\nat Columbia University. (Cheers) (Applause) And then I landed a job at Yale. (Applause) I am proud of everything\nthat I've been able to accomplish on my journey thus far. I have eternal imposter syndrome. Either I've been invited\nbecause I'm a token, which really isn't about me, but rather, about a box\nsomeone needed to check off. Or, I am exceptional, which means I've had to leave\nthe people I love behind. It's the price that I and so many others\npay for learning while black. (Applause) I police myself all the time. Are my pants too tight? Should I wear my hair up or in a fro? Should I speak up for myself, or will the power of my words\nbe reduced to: \"She's angry\"? Why did I have to leave the Bronx to gain access to a better education? And why, in the process\nof getting that better education, did I have to endure the trauma\nof erasing what made me, me -- a black girl from the Bronx,\nraised by an Antiguan mother? So when I think about our current\neducation reform initiatives, I can't help asking: What are our students of color\nlearning about themselves? Three -- three decades of research reveal that students of color\nare suspended and expelled at a rate three times greater\nthan white students, and are punished in harsher ways\nfor the same infractions. They also learn this through the absence\nof their lives and narratives in the curricula. The Cooperative Children's Book Center\ndid a review of nearly 4,000 books and found that only three percent\nwere about African-Americans. And they further learn this through the lack of teachers\nthat look like them. An analysis of data from the National Center\nfor Education Statistics found that 45 percent of our nation's\npre-K to high school students were people of color, while only 17 percent of our teachers are. Our youth of color pay a profound price when their schooling\nsends them the message that they must be controlled, that they must leave\ntheir identities at home in order to be successful. Every child deserves an education that guarantees the safety to learn in the comfort of one's own skin. (Applause) It is possible to create emotionally\nand physically safe classrooms where students also thrive academically. I know, because I did it in my classroom when I returned to teach in the Bronx. So what did that look like? I centered my instruction on the lives, histories\nand identities of my students. And I did all of this\nbecause I wanted my students to know that everyone around them\nwas supporting them to be their best self. So while I could not control\nthe instability of their homes, the uncertainty of their next meal, or the loud neighbors\nthat kept them from sleep, I provided them with a loving classroom that made them feel proud of who they are, that made them know that they mattered. You know, every time I hear\nor say the word \"asking,\" I am in high school again. I am thinking about \"ass\" and \"king\" and putting the two together\nso that I speak in a way where someone in power\nwill want to listen. There is a better way, one that doesn't force kids of color\ninto a double bind; a way for them to preserve their ties to their families, homes and communities; a way that teaches them\nto trust their instincts and to have faith\nin their own creative genius. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 21, "lesson": 14, "title": "Three ways the universe could end - Venus Keus", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/three-ways-the-universe-could-end-venus-keus", "transcript": {"en": "We know about our universe’s past: the Big Bang theory predicts that all \nmatter, time, and space began in an incredibly tiny, compact \nstate about 14 billion years ago. And we know about the present: scientists’ observations of the movement \nof galaxies tell us that the universe is expanding \nat an accelerated rate. But what about the future? Do we know how our universe \nis going to end? Cosmologists have three \npossible answers for this question, called the Big Freeze, the Big Rip and the Big Crunch. To understand these three scenarios, imagine two objects representing galaxies. A short, tight rubber band is \nholding them together— that’s the attractive force of gravity. Meanwhile, two hooks are \npulling them apart— that’s the repulsive force \nexpanding the universe. Copy this system over and over again, and you have something \napproximating the real universe. The outcome of the battle between \nthese two opposing forces determines how the end of the \nuniverse will play out. The Big Freeze scenario is what happens \nif the force pulling the objects apart is just strong enough to stretch the \nrubber band until it loses its elasticity. The expansion wouldn’t be able to \naccelerate anymore, but the universe would keep \ngetting bigger. Clusters of galaxies would separate. The objects within the galaxies– suns, planets, and solar systems would move away from each other, until galaxies dissolved into \nlonely objects floating separately in the vast space. The light they emit would be redshifted \nto long wavelengths with very low, faint energies, and the gas emanating from them \nwould be too thin to create new stars. The universe would become \ndarker and colder, approaching a frozen state also known as the Big Chill, or the Heat Death of the Universe. But what if the repulsive force \nis so strong that it stretches the rubber band \npast its elastic limit, and actually tears it? If the expansion of the universe \ncontinues to accelerate, it will eventually overcome not only \nthe gravitational force – tearing apart galaxies and solar systems– but also the electromagnetic, weak, \nand strong nuclear forces which hold atoms and nuclei together. As a result, the matter that makes up stars \nbreaks into tiny pieces. Even atoms and subatomic particles \nwill be destroyed. That’s the Big Rip. What about the third scenario, where the rubber band wins out? That corresponds to a possible future in which the force of gravity brings the \nuniverse’s expansion to a halt— and then reverses it. Galaxies would start rushing \ntowards each other, and as they clumped together their gravitational pull would \nget even stronger. Stars too would hurtle \ntogether and collide. Temperatures would rise as space \nwould get tighter and tighter. The size of the universe would plummet until everything compressed into such \na small space that even atoms and subatomic particles \nwould have to crunch together. The result would be an incredibly dense,\nhot, compact universe — a lot like the state that \npreceded the Big Bang. This is the Big Crunch. Could this tiny point of matter explode \nin another Big Bang? Could the universe expand and contract\nover and over again, repeating its entire history? The theory describing such a universe \nis known as the Big Bounce. In fact, there’s no way to tell how many \nbounces could’ve already happened— or how many might happen in the future. Each bounce would wipe away any record\nof the universe’s previous history. Which one of those scenarios \nwill be the real one? The answer depends on the exact shape \nof the universe, the amount of dark energy it holds, and changes in its expansion rate. As of now, our observations suggest \nthat we’re heading for a Big Freeze.

Sawubona. In South Africa, where I come from, \"sawubona\" is the Zulu word for \"hello.\" There's a beautiful and powerful\nintention behind the word because \"sawubona\"\nliterally translated means, \"I see you, and by seeing you,\nI bring you into being.\" So beautiful, imagine\nbeing greeted like that. But what does it take\nin the way we see ourselves? Our thoughts, our emotions and our stories that help us to thrive in an increasingly complex\nand fraught world? This crucial question has been\nat the center of my life's work. Because how we deal\nwith our inner world drives everything. Every aspect of how we love, how we live, how we parent and how we lead. The conventional view\nof emotions as good or bad, positive or negative, is rigid. And rigidity in the face\nof complexity is toxic. We need greater levels\nof emotional agility for true resilience and thriving. My journey with this calling began not in the hallowed halls\nof a university, but in the messy, tender business of life. I grew up in the white suburbs\nof apartheid South Africa, a country and community\ncommitted to not seeing. To denial. It's denial that makes 50 years\nof racist legislation possible while people convince themselves\nthat they are doing nothing wrong. And yet, I first learned\nof the destructive power of denial at a personal level, before I understood what it was doing\nto the country of my birth. My father died on a Friday. He was 42 years old and I was 15. My mother whispered to me to go\nand say goodbye to my father before I went to school. So I put my backpack down\nand walked the passage that ran through to where the heart of our home\nmy father lay dying of cancer. His eyes were closed,\nbut he knew I was there. In his presence, I had always felt seen. I told him I loved him, said goodbye and headed off for my day. At school, I drifted from science\nto mathematics to history to biology, as my father slipped from the world. From May to July to September to November, I went about with my usual smile. I didn't drop a single grade. When asked how I was doing,\nI would shrug and say, \"OK.\" I was praised for being strong. I was the master of being OK. But back home, we struggled -- my father hadn't been able\nto keep his small business going during his illness. And my mother, alone,\nwas grieving the love of her life trying to raise three children, and the creditors were knocking. We felt, as a family, financially\nand emotionally ravaged. And I began to spiral down,\nisolated, fast. I started to use food to numb my pain. Binging and purging. Refusing to accept\nthe full weight of my grief. No one knew, and in a culture\nthat values relentless positivity, I thought that no one wanted to know. But one person did not buy into\nmy story of triumph over grief. My eighth-grade English teacher\nfixed me with burning blue eyes as she handed out blank notebooks. She said, \"Write what you're feeling. Tell the truth. Write like nobody's reading.\" And just like that, I was invited to show up\nauthentically to my grief and pain. It was a simple act but nothing short of a revolution for me. It was this revolution\nthat started in this blank notebook 30 years ago that shaped my life's work. The secret, silent\ncorrespondence with myself. Like a gymnast, I started to move beyond\nthe rigidity of denial into what I've now come to call emotional agility. Life's beauty is inseparable\nfrom its fragility. We are young until we are not. We walk down the streets sexy until one day we realize\nthat we are unseen. We nag our children and one day realize that there is silence\nwhere that child once was, now making his or her way in the world. We are healthy until a diagnosis\nbrings us to our knees. The only certainty is uncertainty, and yet we are not navigating\nthis frailty successfully or sustainably. The World Health Organization\ntells us that depression is now the single leading cause\nof disability globally -- outstripping cancer, outstripping heart disease. And at a time of greater complexity, unprecedented technological,\npolitical and economic change, we are seeing how people's tendency is more and more to lock down\ninto rigid responses to their emotions. On the one hand we might\nobsessively brood on our feelings. Getting stuck inside our heads. Hooked on being right. Or victimized by our news feed. On the other, we might\nbottle our emotions, pushing them aside and permitting only those emotions\ndeemed legitimate. In a survey I recently conducted\nwith over 70,000 people, I found that a third of us -- a third -- either judge ourselves for having\nso-called \"bad emotions,\" like sadness, anger or even grief. Or actively try to push aside\nthese feelings. We do this not only to ourselves, but also to people we love,\nlike our children -- we may inadvertently shame them\nout of emotions seen as negative, jump to a solution, and fail to help them to see these emotions\nas inherently valuable. Normal, natural emotions\nare now seen as good or bad. And being positive has become\na new form of moral correctness. People with cancer are automatically told\nto just stay positive. Women, to stop being so angry. And the list goes on. It's a tyranny. It's a tyranny of positivity. And it's cruel. Unkind. And ineffective. And we do it to ourselves, and we do it to others. If there's one common feature of brooding, bottling\nor false positivity, it's this: they are all rigid responses. And if there's a single\nlesson we can learn from the inevitable fall of apartheid it is that rigid denial doesn't work. It's unsustainable. For individuals, for families, for societies. And as we watch the ice caps melt, it is unsustainable for our planet. Research on emotional suppression shows that when emotions\nare pushed aside or ignored, they get stronger. Psychologists call this amplification. Like that delicious chocolate cake\nin the refrigerator -- the more you try to ignore it ... (Laughter) the greater its hold on you. You might think you're in control\nof unwanted emotions when you ignore them, but in fact they control you. Internal pain always comes out. Always. And who pays the price? We do. Our children, our colleagues, our communities. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not anti-happiness. I like being happy. I'm a pretty happy person. But when we push aside normal emotions\nto embrace false positivity, we lose our capacity to develop skills\nto deal with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. I've had hundreds of people tell me\nwhat they don't want to feel. They say things like, \"I don't want to try because\nI don't want to feel disappointed.\" Or, \"I just want this feeling to go away.\" \"I understand,\" I say to them. \"But you have dead people's goals.\" (Laughter) (Applause) Only dead people never get unwanted or inconvenienced\nby their feelings. (Laughter) Only dead people never get stressed, never get broken hearts, never experience the disappointment\nthat comes with failure. Tough emotions are part\nof our contract with life. You don't get to have a meaningful career or raise a family or leave the world a better place without stress and discomfort. Discomfort is the price of admission\nto a meaningful life. So, how do we begin to dismantle rigidity and embrace emotional agility? As that young schoolgirl, when I leaned into those blank pages, I started to do away with feelings of what I should be experiencing. And instead started to open my heart\nto what I did feel. Pain. And grief. And loss. And regret. Research now shows that the radical acceptance\nof all of our emotions -- even the messy, difficult ones -- is the cornerstone\nto resilience, thriving, and true, authentic happiness. But emotional agility is more\nthat just an acceptance of emotions. We also know that accuracy matters. In my own research,\nI found that words are essential. We often use quick and easy labels\nto describe our feelings. \"I'm stressed\" is the most\ncommon one I hear. But there's a world of difference\nbetween stress and disappointment or stress and that knowing dread\nof \"I'm in the wrong career.\" When we label our emotions accurately, we are more able to discern\nthe precise cause of our feelings. And what scientists call\nthe readiness potential in our brain is activated, allowing us\nto take concrete steps. But not just any steps --\nthe right steps for us. Because our emotions are data. Our emotions contain flashing lights\nto things that we care about. We tend not to feel strong emotion to stuff that doesn't mean\nanything in our worlds. If you feel rage when you read the news, that rage is a signpost, perhaps,\nthat you value equity and fairness -- and an opportunity to take active steps to shape your life in that direction. When we are open\nto the difficult emotions, we are able to generate responses\nthat are values-aligned. But there's an important caveat. Emotions are data,\nthey are not directives. We can show up to and mine\nour emotions for their values without needing to listen to them. Just like I can show up to my son\nin his frustration with his baby sister -- but not endorse his idea\nthat he gets to give her away to the first stranger\nhe sees in a shopping mall. (Laughter) We own our emotions, they don't own us. When we internalize the difference\nbetween how I feel in all my wisdom and what I do in a values-aligned action, we generate the pathway to our best selves via our emotions. So, what does this look like in practice? When you feel a strong, tough emotion, don't race for the emotional exits. Learn its contours, show up\nto the journal of your hearts. What is the emotion telling you? And try not to say \"I am,\"\nas in, \"I'm angry\" or \"I'm sad.\" When you say \"I am\" it makes you sound\nas if you are the emotion. Whereas you are you,\nand the emotion is a data source. Instead, try to notice\nthe feeling for what it is: \"I'm noticing that I'm feeling sad\" or \"I'm noticing that I'm feeling angry.\" These are essential skills for us, our families, our communities. They're also critical to the workplace. In my research, when I looked at what helps people\nto bring the best of themselves to work, I found a powerful key contributor: individualized consideration. When people are allowed\nto feel their emotional truth, engagement, creativity and innovation\nflourish in the organization. Diversity isn't just people, it's also what's inside people. Including diversity of emotion. The most agile, resilient\nindividuals, teams, organizations, families, communities are built on an openness\nto the normal human emotions. It's this that allows us to say, \"What is my emotion telling me?\" \"Which action will bring me\ntowards my values?\" \"Which will take me away from my values?\" Emotional agility is the ability\nto be with your emotions with curiosity, compassion, and especially the courage\nto take values-connected steps. When I was little, I would wake up at night\nterrified by the idea of death. My father would comfort me\nwith soft pats and kisses. But he would never lie. \"We all die, Susie,\" he would say. \"It's normal to be scared.\" He didn't try to invent\na buffer between me and reality. It took me a while to understand the power of how he guided me\nthrough those nights. What he showed me is that courage\nis not an absence of fear; courage is fear walking. Neither of us knew that in 10 short years, he would be gone. And that time for each of us\nis all too precious and all too brief. But when our moment comes to face our fragility, in that ultimate time, it will ask us, \"Are you agile?\" \"Are you agile?\" Let the moment be an unreserved \"yes.\" A \"yes\" born of a lifelong\ncorrespondence with your own heart. And in seeing yourself. Because in seeing yourself, you are also able to see others, too: the only sustainable way forward in a fragile, beautiful world. Sawubona. And thank you. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Graziano", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-consciousness-michael-s-a-graziano", "transcript": {"en": "Here are two images of a house. There’s one obvious difference, but to this patient, P.S., they looked completely identical. P.S. had suffered a stroke that \ndamaged the right side of her brain, leaving her unaware of everything \non her left side. But though she could discern no difference\nbetween the houses, when researchers asked her \nwhich she would prefer to live in, she chose the house that wasn’t burning— not once, but again and again. P.S.’s brain was still processing \ninformation from her whole field of vision. She could see both images and tell the difference between them, she just didn’t know it. If someone threw a ball at her left side, she might duck. But she wouldn’t have any \nawareness of the ball, or any idea why she ducked. P.S.’s condition, known as hemispatial neglect, reveals an important distinction between \nthe brain’s processing of information and our experience of that processing. That experience is what \nwe call consciousness. We are conscious of both the external \nworld and our internal selves— we are aware of an image in much the same way we are aware of \nourselves looking at an image, or our inner thoughts and emotions. But where does consciousness come from? Scientists, theologians, and philosophers have been trying to get to the bottom of \nthis question for centuries— without reaching any consensus. One recent theory is that consciousness is the brain’s imperfect \npicture of its own activity. To understand this theory, it helps to have a clear idea of one important way the brain processes \ninformation from our senses. Based on sensory input, it builds models, which are continuously updating,\nsimplified descriptions of objects and events in the world. Everything we know is based \non these models. They never capture every detail of \nthe things they describe, just enough for the brain to determine \nappropriate responses. For instance, one model built deep \ninto the visual system codes white light as brightness \nwithout color. In reality, white light includes wavelengths that correspond to all the \ndifferent colors we can see. Our perception of white light is wrong \nand oversimplified, but good enough for us to function. Likewise, the brain’s model of the \nphysical body keeps track of the configuration \nof our limbs, but not of individual cells \nor even muscles, because that level of information \nisn’t needed to plan movement. If it didn’t have the model keeping track \nof the body’s size, shape, and how it is moving at any moment, we would quickly injure ourselves. The brain also needs models of itself. For example, the brain has the ability to pay attention\nto specific objects and events. It also controls that focus, shifting it from one thing to another, internal and external, according to our needs. Without the ability to direct our focus, we wouldn’t be able to assess threats, \nfinish a meal, or function at all. To control focus effectively, the brain has to construct a model \nof its own attention. With 86 billion neurons constantly \ninteracting with each other, there’s no way the brain’s model of its \nown information processing can be perfectly self-descriptive. But like the model of the body, or our conception of white light, it doesn’t have to be. Our certainty that we have a \nmetaphysical, subjective experience may come from one of the brain’s models, a cut-corner description of what it means\nto process information in a focused and deep manner. Scientists have already begun trying \nto figure out how the brain creates that self model. MRI studies are a promising avenue \nfor pinpointing the networks involved. These studies compare patterns \nof neural activation when someone is and isn’t conscious \nof a sensory stimulus, like an image. The results show that the areas needed \nfor visual processing are activated whether or not the \nparticipant is aware of the image, but a whole additional network lights up only when they are conscious \nof seeing the image. Patients with hemispatial neglect, \nlike P.S., typically have damage to one particular \npart of this network. More extensive damage to the network \ncan sometimes lead to a vegetative state, with no sign of consciousness. Evidence like this brings us closer \nto understanding how consciousness is built into the brain, but there’s still much more to learn. For instance, the way neurons in the networks \nrelated to consciousness compute specific pieces of information is outside the scope of our \ncurrent technology. As we approach questions of consciousness \nwith science, we’ll open new lines of inquiry \ninto human identity."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A person with hemispatial neglect loses awareness of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Everything"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Everything on the same side of space as the associated brain damage"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Everything on the opposite side of space as the associated brain damage"}, {"label": "D", "text": "His or her own body"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Patient P.S. could", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Respond to everything she saw, even if she didn’t realize why"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Respond only to images on the left side of space"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Respond only to images on the right side of space"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Respond to images only if they were pointed out to her"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The brain builds models to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Keep track of the internal state of the body"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Keep track of the external world"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Keep track of its own ability to process information"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "People’s perception of white light", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Is accurate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Is based on an inaccurate internal model"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Is culturally learned"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Can change once we understand the physics of light"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "MRI scans of the brain can help in understanding consciousness by", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decoding people’s perceptions of the world"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Altering brain activity in a controlled manner"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Identifying the brain’s model of the body"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Showing the networks of neurons in the brain associated with conscious states"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 21, "lesson": 17, "title": "Don't ask where I'm from, ask where I'm a local - Taiye Selasi", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/v2J4JEi6", "transcript": {"en": "Last year, I went on my first book tour. In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries and gave some hundred talks. Every talk in every country began with an introduction, and every introduction began,\nalas, with a lie: \"Taiye Selasi comes\nfrom Ghana and Nigeria,\" or \"Taiye Selasi comes\nfrom England and the States.\" Whenever I heard this opening sentence, no matter the country that concluded it -- England, America, Ghana, Nigeria -- I thought, \"But that's not true.\" Yes, I was born in England\nand grew up in the United States. My mum, born in England,\nand raised in Nigeria, currently lives in Ghana. My father was born in Gold Coast,\na British colony, raised in Ghana, and has lived for over 30 years\nin the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For this reason, my introducers\nalso called me \"multinational.\" \"But Nike is multinational,\" I thought, \"I'm a human being.\" Then, one fine day, mid-tour, I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark where I shared the stage\nwith the writer Colum McCann. We were discussing the role\nof locality in writing, when suddenly it hit me. I'm not multinational. I'm not a national at all. How could I come from a nation? How can a human being come from a concept? It's a question that had been bothering me\nfor going on two decades. From newspapers, textbooks, conversations, I had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal, singular,\nnaturally occurring things, but I wondered: to say that I came from a country suggested that the country\nwas an absolute, some fixed point in place in time, a constant thing, but was it? In my lifetime, countries\nhad disappeared -- Czechoslovakia; appeared -- Timor-Leste;\nfailed -- Somalia. My parents came from countries\nthat didn't exist when they were born. To me, a country -- this thing that could\nbe born, die, expand, contract -- hardly seemed the basis\nfor understanding a human being. And so it came as a huge relief\nto discover the sovereign state. What we call countries are actually various expressions\nof sovereign statehood, an idea that came into fashion\nonly 400 years ago. When I learned this, beginning my\nmasters degree in international relations, I felt a sort of surge of relief. It was as I had suspected. History was real, cultures were real, but countries were invented. For the next 10 years, I sought\nto re- or un-define myself, my world, my work, my experience, beyond the logic of the state. In 2005, I wrote an essay,\n\"What is an Afropolitan,\" sketching out an identity\nthat privileged culture over country. It was thrilling how many people\ncould relate to my experience, and instructional how many others\ndidn't buy my sense of self. \"How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana,\"\none such critic asked, \"when she's never known the indignities of traveling abroad\non a Ghanian passport?\" Now, if I'm honest, I knew just what she meant. I've got a friend named Layla\nwho was born and raised in Ghana. Her parents are third-generation\nGhanians of Lebanese descent. Layla, who speaks fluent Twi,\nknows Accra like the back of her hand, but when we first met years ago,\nI thought, \"She's not from Ghana.\" In my mind, she came from Lebanon, despite the patent fact\nthat all her formative experience took place in suburban Accra. I, like my critics, was imagining some Ghana\nwhere all Ghanaians had brown skin or none held U.K. passports. I'd fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming\nfrom countries sets -- the privileging of a fiction,\nthe singular country, over reality: human experience. Speaking with Colum McCann that day,\nthe penny finally dropped. \"All experience is local,\" he said. \"All identity is experience,\" I thought. \"I'm not a national,\"\nI proclaimed onstage. \"I'm a local. I'm multi-local.\" See, \"Taiye Selasi comes\nfrom the United States,\" isn't the truth. I have no relationship\nwith the United States, all 50 of them, not really. My relationship is with Brookline,\nthe town where I grew up; with New York City, where I started work; with Lawrenceville,\nwhere I spend Thanksgiving. What makes America home for me\nis not my passport or accent, but these very particular experiences and the places they occur. Despite my pride in Ewe culture, the Black Stars,\nand my love of Ghanaian food, I've never had a relationship\nwith the Republic of Ghana, writ large. My relationship is with Accra,\nwhere my mother lives, where I go each year, with the little garden in Dzorwulu\nwhere my father and I talk for hours. These are the places\nthat shape my experience. My experience is where I'm from. What if we asked, instead\nof \"Where are you from?\" -- \"Where are you a local?\" This would tell us so much more\nabout who and how similar we are. Tell me you're from France,\nand I see what, a set of clichés? Adichie's dangerous single story,\nthe myth of the nation of France? Tell me you're a local of Fez and Paris, better yet, Goutte d'Or, and I see\na set of experiences. Our experience is where we're from. So, where are you a local? I propose a three-step test. I call these the three \"R’s\":\nrituals, relationships, restrictions. First, think of your daily rituals,\nwhatever they may be: making your coffee, driving to work, harvesting your crops,\nsaying your prayers. What kind of rituals are these? Where do they occur? In what city or cities in the world\ndo shopkeepers know your face? As a child, I carried out fairly standard\nsuburban rituals in Boston, with adjustments made for the rituals\nmy mother brought from London and Lagos. We took off our shoes in the house, we were unfailingly\npolite with our elders, we ate slow-cooked, spicy food. In snowy North America,\nours were rituals of the global South. The first time I went to Delhi\nor to southern parts of Italy, I was shocked by how at home I felt. The rituals were familiar. \"R\" number one, rituals. Now, think of your relationships,\nof the people who shape your days. To whom do you speak at least once a week, be it face to face or on FaceTime? Be reasonable in your assessment; I'm not talking about\nyour Facebook friends. I'm speaking of the people who shape\nyour weekly emotional experience. My mother in Accra,\nmy twin sister in Boston, my best friends in New York: these relationships are home for me. \"R\" number two, relationships. We're local where we carry out\nour rituals and relationships, but how we experience our locality depends in part on our restrictions. By restrictions, I mean,\nwhere are you able to live? What passport do you hold? Are you restricted by, say, racism,\nfrom feeling fully at home where you live? By civil war, dysfunctional governance,\neconomic inflation, from living in the locality\nwhere you had your rituals as a child? This is the least sexy of the R’s, less lyric than rituals and relationships, but the question takes us past\n\"Where are you now?\" to \"Why aren't you there, and why?\" Rituals, relationships, restrictions. Take a piece of paper and put those three words\non top of three columns, then try to fill those columns\nas honestly as you can. A very different picture\nof your life in local context, of your identity as a set of experiences, may emerge. So let's try it. I have a friend named Olu. He's 35 years old. His parents, born in Nigeria,\ncame to Germany on scholarships. Olu was born in Nuremberg\nand lived there until age 10. When his family moved to Lagos,\nhe studied in London, then came to Berlin. He loves going to Nigeria -- the weather, the food, the friends -- but hates the political corruption there. Where is Olu from? I have another friend named Udo. He's also 35 years old. Udo was born in Córdoba,\nin northwest Argentina, where his grandparents migrated\nfrom Germany, what is now Poland, after the war. Udo studied in Buenos Aires,\nand nine years ago came to Berlin. He loves going to Argentina -- \nthe weather, the food, the friends -- but hates the economic corruption there. Where is Udo from? With his blonde hair and blue eyes,\nUdo could pass for German, but holds an Argentinian passport,\nso needs a visa to live in Berlin. That Udo is from Argentina\nhas largely to do with history. That he's a local\nof Buenos Aires and Berlin, that has to do with life. Olu, who looks Nigerian,\nneeds a visa to visit Nigeria. He speaks Yoruba with an English accent, and English with a German one. To claim that he's\n\"not really Nigerian,\" though, denies his experience in Lagos, the rituals he practiced growing up, his relationship with family and friends. Meanwhile, though Lagos\nis undoubtedly one of his homes, Olu always feels restricted there, not least by the fact that he's gay. Both he and Udo are restricted\nby the political conditions of their parents' countries, from living where some of their\nmost meaningful rituals and relationships occur. To say Olu is from Nigeria\nand Udo is from Argentina distracts from their common experience. Their rituals, their relationships,\nand their restrictions are the same. Of course, when we ask,\n\"Where are you from?\" we're using a kind of shorthand. It's quicker to say \"Nigeria\"\nthan \"Lagos and Berlin,\" and as with Google Maps,\nwe can always zoom in closer, from country to city to neighborhood. But that's not quite the point. The difference between\n\"Where are you from?\" and \"Where are you a local?\" isn't the specificity of the answer; it's the intention of the question. Replacing the language of nationality\nwith the language of locality asks us to shift our focus\nto where real life occurs. Even that most glorious expression\nof countryhood, the World Cup, gives us national teams comprised\nmostly of multilocal players. As a unit of measurement\nfor human experience, the country doesn't quite work. That's why Olu says, \"I'm German,\nbut my parents come from Nigeria.\" The \"but\" in that sentence\nbelies the inflexibility of the units, one fixed and fictional entity\nbumping up against another. \"I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin,\"\nsuggests overlapping experiences, layers that merge together,\nthat can't be denied or removed. You can take away my passport, but you can't take away my experience. That I carry within me. Where I'm from comes wherever I go. To be clear, I'm not suggesting\nthat we do away with countries. There's much to be said\nfor national history, more for the sovereign state. Culture exists in community,\nand community exists in context. Geography, tradition, collective memory:\nthese things are important. What I'm questioning is primacy. All of those introductions on tour\nbegan with reference to nation, as if knowing what country I came\nfrom would tell my audience who I was. What are we really seeking, though,\nwhen we ask where someone comes from? And what are we really seeing\nwhen we hear an answer? Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power. \"Where are you from?\"\nMexico. Poland. Bangladesh. Less power. America. Germany. Japan. More power. China. Russia. Ambiguous. (Laughter) It's possible that without realizing it,\nwe're playing a power game, especially in the context\nof multi-ethnic countries. As any recent immigrant knows, the question \"Where are you from?\"\nor \"Where are you really from?\" is often code for \"Why are you here?\" Then we have the scholar\nWilliam Deresiewicz's writing of elite American colleges. \"Students think that\ntheir environment is diverse if one comes from Missouri\nand another from Pakistan -- never mind that all of their parents\nare doctors or bankers.\" I'm with him. To call one student American,\nanother Pakistani, then triumphantly claim\nstudent body diversity ignores the fact that these students\nare locals of the same milieu. The same holds true on the other end\nof the economic spectrum. A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles\nand a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi have more in common\nin terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality implies. Perhaps my biggest problem\nwith coming from countries is the myth of going back to them. I'm often asked if I plan\nto \"go back\" to Ghana. I go to Accra every year,\nbut I can't \"go back\" to Ghana. It's not because I wasn't born there. My father can't go back, either. The country in which he was born, that country no longer exists. We can never go back to a place\nand find it exactly where we left it. Something, somewhere\nwill always have changed, most of all, ourselves. People. Finally, what we're talking\nabout is human experience, this notoriously and gloriously\ndisorderly affair. In creative writing,\nlocality bespeaks humanity. The more we know\nabout where a story is set, the more local color and texture, the more human\nthe characters start to feel, the more relatable, not less. The myth of national identity\nand the vocabulary of coming from confuses us into placing ourselves\ninto mutually exclusive categories. In fact, all of us are multi --\nmulti-local, multi-layered. To begin our conversations\nwith an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together, I think,\nnot further apart. So the next time that I'm introduced, I'd love to hear the truth: \"Taiye Selasi is a human being,\nlike everybody here. She isn't a citizen of the world,\nbut a citizen of worlds. She is a local of New York,\nRome and Accra.\" Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

This is no ordinary storm, \nbut a violent and vengeful tempest, and it sets the stage for Shakespeare’s\nmost enigmatic play. As the skies clear, \nwe are invited into a world that seems far removed from our own,\nbut is rife with familiar concerns about freedom, power, and control. The Tempest is set on a desert island,\nexposed to the elements and ruled with magic and might by \nProspero, the exiled Duke of Milan. Betrayed by his brother Antonio, \nProspero has been marooned on the island for twelve years with his daughter Miranda\nand his beloved books. In this time he’s learned the \nmagic of the island and uses it to harness its \nelementary spirits. He also rules over the island’s\nonly earthly inhabitant, the dejected and demonized Caliban. But after years of plotting revenge,\nProspero’s foe is finally in sight. With the help of the \nfluttering sprite Ariel, the magician destroys his brother’s ship\nand washes its sailors ashore. Prospero’s plotting even extends to his\ndaughter’s love life, whom he plans to fall for \nstranded prince Ferdinand. And as Prospero and Ariel\nclose in on Antonio, Caliban joins forces with some \ndrunken sailors, who hatch a comic plot \nto take the island. The play strips society down\nto its basest desires, with each faction in hot pursuit of power-\nbe it over the land, other people, or their own destiny. But Shakespeare knows that power is\nalways a moving target; and as he reveals\nthese characters’ dark histories, we begin to wonder if this\nvicious cycle will ever end. Although Prospero was wronged by Antonio, he has long inflicted his\nown abuses on the island, hoarding its magical properties\nand natural re-sources for himself. Caliban especially resents\nthis takeover. The son of Sycorax, a witch who previously\nruled the island, he initially helped the \nexiles find their footing. But he’s since become their slave,\nand rants with furious regret: “And then I loved thee,/\nAnd showed thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle/\nThe fresh springs, brine pits, barren place \nand fertile./ Cursed be I that did so!” With his thunderous language\nand seething anger, Caliban constantly reminds\nProspero of what came before: this island’s mine by Sycorax my mother,\nWhich thou takest from me. Yet Sycorax also abused the island, and imprisoned Ariel until \nProspero released him. Now Ariel spends the play hoping to repay\nhis debt and earn his freedom, while Caliban is enslaved indefinitely,\nor at least as long as Prospero is in charge. For these reasons and many more, The Tempest has often been read as\nan exploration of colonialism, and the moral dilemmas that come\nwith en-counters of “brave new world(s).\" Questions of agency and justice\nhang over the play: is Caliban the rightful \nmaster of the land? Will Ariel flutter free?  And is Prospero the \nmighty overseer- or is there some deeper magic at work,\nbeyond any one character's grasp? Throughout the play, Ariel constantly reminds Prospero\nof the freedom he is owed. But the question lingers of whether\nthe invader will be able to relinquish his grip. The question of ending one’s reign is\nparticularly potent given that The Tempest is believed to be \nShakespeare’s final play. In many ways Prospero’s actions echo that\nof the great entertainer him-self, who hatched elaborate plots,\nmaneuvered those around him, and cast a spell over characters\nand audience alike. But by the end of his grand performance\nof power and control, Prospero’s final lines see him humbled\nby his audience - and the power\nthat they hold over his creations. \"With the help of your good hands./\nGentle breath of yours my sails/ Must fill or else my project fails,/\nWhich was to please.\" This evokes Shakespeare’s own role\nas the great entertainer who surrenders himself,\nultimately, to our applause."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where is The Tempest mostly set?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In Milan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "On a desert island"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In Mantua"}, {"label": "D", "text": "At sea"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The magical members of the cast include all of the following EXCEPT:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Caliban"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Miranda"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ariel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Proposero"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The relationship between Caliban and Prospero can best be described by which of the following statements", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prospero treats Caliban as his equal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Caliban has power over Prospero"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prospero treats Caliban as his slave"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Prospero treats Caliban as his indentured servant"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Because of its themes, The Tempest has often been read as an exploration of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Colonialism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Witch hunts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The War of the Roses"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Civil war"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Apparently, that was something\nhumans have created by our way of living. I was told to turn off\nthe lights to save energy and to recycle paper to save resources. I remember thinking\nthat it was very strange that humans, who are\nan animal species among others, could be capable of changing\nthe Earth's climate. Because if we were,\nand if it was really happening, we wouldn't be talking\nabout anything else. As soon as you'd turn on the TV,\neverything would be about that. Headlines, radio, newspapers, you would never read or hear\nabout anything else, as if there was a world war going on. But no one ever talked about it. If burning fossil fuels was so bad\nthat it threatened our very existence, how could we just continue like before? Why were there no restrictions? Why wasn't it made illegal? To me, that did not add up. It was too unreal. So when I was 11, I became ill. I fell into depression, I stopped talking, and I stopped eating. In two months, I lost\nabout 10 kilos of weight. Later on, I was diagnosed\nwith Asperger syndrome, OCD and selective mutism. That basically means I only speak\nwhen I think it's necessary - now is one of those moments. (Applause) For those of us who are on the spectrum, almost everything is black or white. We aren't very good at lying, and we usually don't enjoy\nparticipating in this social game that the rest of you seem so fond of. (Laughter) I think in many ways\nthat we autistic are the normal ones, and the rest of the people\nare pretty strange, (Laughter) especially when it comes to\nthe sustainability crisis, where everyone keeps saying\nclimate change is an existential threat and the most important issue of all, and yet they just carry on like before. I don't understand that, because if the emissions have to stop, then we must stop the emissions. To me that is black or white. There are no gray areas\nwhen it comes to survival. Either we go on\nas a civilization or we don't. We have to change. Rich countries like Sweden\nneed to start reducing emissions by at least 15 percent every year. And that is so that we can stay\nbelow a two-degree warming target. Yet, as the IPCC\nhave recently demonstrated, aiming instead for 1.5 degrees Celsius would significantly\nreduce the climate impacts. But we can only imagine\nwhat that means for reducing emissions. You would think the media\nand every one of our leaders would be talking about nothing else, but they never even mention it. Nor does anyone ever mention the greenhouse gases\nalready locked in the system. Nor that air pollution is hiding a warming so that when we stop burning fossil fuels, we already have an extra level of warming perhaps as high as\n0.5 to 1.1 degrees Celsius. Furthermore does hardly\nanyone speak about the fact that we are in the midst\nof the sixth mass extinction, with up to 200 species\ngoing extinct every single day, that the extinction rate today is between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than what is seen as normal. Nor does hardly anyone ever speak about\nthe aspect of equity or climate justice, clearly stated everywhere\nin the Paris Agreement, which is absolutely necessary\nto make it work on a global scale. That means that rich countries need to get down to zero emissions\nwithin 6 to 12 years, with today's emission speed. And that is so that people\nin poorer countries can have a chance to heighten\ntheir standard of living by building some of the infrastructure\nthat we have already built, such as roads, schools, hospitals, clean drinking water,\nelectricity, and so on. Because how can we expect\ncountries like India or Nigeria to care about the climate crisis if we who already have everything\ndon't care even a second about it or our actual commitments\nto the Paris Agreement? So, why are we not reducing our emissions? Why are they in fact still increasing? Are we knowingly causing\na mass extinction? Are we evil? No, of course not. People keep doing what they do because the vast majority\ndoesn't have a clue about the actual consequences\nof our everyday life, and they don't know\nthat rapid change is required. We all think we know,\nand we all think everybody knows, but we don't. Because how could we? If there really was a crisis, and if this crisis was caused\nby our emissions, you would at least see some signs. Not just flooded cities,\ntens of thousands of dead people, and whole nations leveled\nto piles of torn down buildings. You would see some restrictions. But no. And no one talks about it. There are no emergency meetings,\nno headlines, no breaking news. No one is acting\nas if we were in a crisis. Even most climate scientists\nor green politicians keep on flying around the world,\neating meat and dairy. If I live to be 100,\nI will be alive in the year 2103. When you think about the future today,\nyou don't think beyond the year 2050. By then, I will, in the best case,\nnot even have lived half of my life. What happens next? The year 2078, I will celebrate\nmy 75th birthday. If I have children or grandchildren,\nmaybe they will spend that day with me. Maybe they will ask me about you, the people who were around, back in 2018. Maybe they will ask\nwhy you didn't do anything while there still was time to act. What we do or don't do right now\nwill affect my entire life and the lives of my children\nand grandchildren. What we do or don't do right now, me and my generation\ncan't undo in the future. So when school\nstarted in August of this year, I decided that this was enough. I set myself down on the ground\noutside the Swedish parliament. I school striked for the climate. Some people say that I\nshould be in school instead. Some people say that I should study\nto become a climate scientist so that I can \"solve the climate crisis.\" But the climate crisis\nhas already been solved. We already have\nall the facts and solutions. All we have to do is\nto wake up and change. And why should I be studying for a future\nthat soon will be no more when no one is doing anything\nwhatsoever to save that future? And what is the point of learning facts\nin the school system when the most important facts given by the finest science\nof that same school system clearly means nothing\nto our politicians and our society. Some people say that Sweden\nis just a small country, and that it doesn't matter what we do, but I think that if a few children\ncan get headlines all over the world just by not coming to school\nfor a few weeks, imagine what we could all do\ntogether if you wanted to. (Applause) Now we're almost at the end of my talk, and this is where people\nusually start talking about hope, solar panels, wind power,\ncircular economy, and so on, but I'm not going to do that. We've had 30 years of pep-talking\nand selling positive ideas. And I'm sorry,\nbut it doesn't work. Because if it would have, the emissions would have gone down by now. They haven't. And yes, we do need hope, of course we do. But the one thing we need\nmore than hope is action. Once we start to act,\nhope is everywhere. So instead of looking for hope, look for action. Then, and only then, hope will come. Today, we use 100 million\nbarrels of oil every single day. There are no politics to change that. There are no rules\nto keep that oil in the ground. So we can't save the world\nby playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed. Everything needs to change, and it has to start today. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Shipping containers washed overboard, and the waves swept 28,000 rubber ducks \nand other toys into the North Pacific. But they didn’t stick together. Quite the opposite– the ducks have since washed up \nall over the world, and researchers have used their paths to chart a better understanding\nof ocean currents. Ocean currents are driven \nby a range of sources: the wind, tides, changes in water density, and the rotation of the Earth. The topography of the ocean floor \nand the shoreline modifies those motions, causing currents to speed up, slow down, or change direction. Ocean currents fall into \ntwo main categories: surface currents and deep ocean currents. Surface currents control the motion of the top 10 percent \nof the ocean’s water, while deep-ocean currents mobilize \nthe other 90 percent. Though they have different causes, surface and deep ocean currents \ninfluence each other in an intricate dance that keeps \nthe entire ocean moving. Near the shore, surface currents are driven \nby both the wind and tides, which draw water back and forth \nas the water level falls and rises. Meanwhile, in the open ocean, wind is the \nmajor force behind surface currents. As wind blows over the ocean, it drags the top layers \nof water along with it. That moving water pulls on \nthe layers underneath, and those pull on the ones beneath them. In fact, water as deep as 400 meters is still affected by the wind \nat the ocean’s surface. If you zoom out to look at the patterns \nof surface currents all over the earth, you’ll see that they form \nbig loops called gyres, which travel clockwise \nin the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise \nin the southern hemisphere. That’s because of the way \nthe Earth’s rotation affects the wind patterns that\ngive rise to these currents. If the earth didn’t rotate, air and water would simply \nmove back and forth between low pressure at the equator and high pressure at the poles. But as the earth spins, air moving from the equator to the \nNorth Pole is deflected eastward, and air moving back down \nis deflected westward. The mirror image happens \nin the southern hemisphere, so that the major streams of wind form loop-like patterns \naround the ocean basins. This is called the Coriolis Effect. The winds push the ocean beneath \nthem into the same rotating gyres. And because water holds onto heat \nmore effectively than air, these currents help redistribute \nwarmth around the globe. Unlike surface currents, deep ocean currents are driven primarily \nby changes in the density of seawater. As water moves towards the North Pole, it gets colder. It also has a higher \nconcentration of salt, because the ice crystals that form \ntrap water while leaving salt behind. This cold, salty water is more dense, so it sinks, and warmer surface water takes its place, setting up a vertical current called \nthermohaline circulation. Thermohaline circulation of deep water \nand wind-driven surface currents combine to form a winding loop \ncalled the Global Conveyor Belt. As water moves from the depths of \nthe ocean to the surface, it carries nutrients that nourish the \nmicroorganisms which form the base of many \nocean food chains. The global conveyor belt is the\nlongest current in the world, snaking all around the globe. But it only moves a few \ncentimeters per second. It could take a drop of water \na thousand years to make the full trip. However, rising sea temperatures are \ncausing the conveyor belt to seemingly slow down. Models show this causing havoc with \nweather systems on both sides of the Atlantic, and no one knows what would happen if it \ncontinues to slow or if it stopped altogether. The only way we’ll be able to forecast\ncorrectly and prepare accordingly will be to continue to study currents \nand the powerful forces that shape them."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are ocean currents driven by?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wind"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tides"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Changes in Water Density"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rotation of the Earth"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What are the two main categories of ocean currents?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "surface currents and deep ocean currents"}, {"label": "B", "text": "mid-level currents and deep ocean currents"}, {"label": "C", "text": "surface gyres and deep gyres"}, {"label": "D", "text": "rotating gyres and non-rotating gyres"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Deep-ocean currents mobilize only 10% of the Earth’s water.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Water as deep as _______ is still affected by the wind at the Earth’s surface.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50 meters"}, {"label": "B", "text": "250 meters"}, {"label": "C", "text": "400 meters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "700 meters"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How quickly does the global conveyor belt move?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2 kilometers per hour"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2 meters per hour"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2 meters per second"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A few centimeters per second"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
