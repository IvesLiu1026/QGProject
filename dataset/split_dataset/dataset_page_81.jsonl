It’s time to buckle down, \nopen your computer... and check your phone. Maybe catch up on your favorite\nYouTube channel? Actually, you should probably \nmake dinner first. You usually like cooking, though it’s hard to enjoy with this work\nhanging over your head, and oh— it’s actually pretty late! Maybe you should just try again\nin the morning? This is the cycle of procrastination,\nand I promise you, we have all been there. But why do we keep procrastinating \neven when we know it’s bad for us? To be clear, putting something off isn’t\nalways procrastinating. Responsible time management requires\ndeciding which tasks are important and which ones can wait. Procrastination is when we avoid a task \nwe said we would do, for no good reason, despite expecting our behavior \nto bring negative consequences. Obviously, it’s irrational to do something\nyou expect to harm you. But ironically, procrastination is the \nresult of our bodies trying to protect us, specifically by avoiding a task \nwe see as threatening. When you realize you need\nto write that report, your brain responds like it would\nto any incoming threat. Your amygdala, a set of neurons \ninvolved in emotional processing and threat identification, releases hormones including adrenaline\nthat kick off a fear response. This stress-induced panic can overpower\nthe impulses from your prefrontal cortex, which typically help you think \nlong term and regulate your emotions. And it’s in the midst\nof this fight, flight, or freeze response that you decide to handle the threat by avoiding it in favor\nof some less stressful task. This response might seem extreme— after all, it’s just a deadline,\nnot a bear attack. But we’re most likely to procrastinate\ntasks that evoke negative feelings, such as dread, incompetence,\nand insecurity. Studies of procrastinating university\nstudents have found participants were more likely to put off tasks they\nperceived as stressful or challenging. And the perception of how difficult\nthe task is increases while you’re putting it off. In one experiment, students were given\nreminders to study throughout the day. While they were studying,\nmost reported that it wasn’t so bad. But when they were procrastinating, they consistently rated the idea\nof studying as very stressful, making it difficult to get started. Because procrastination is motivated\nby our negative feelings, some individuals are more susceptible\nto it than others. People who have difficulty\nregulating their emotions and those who struggle \nwith low self-esteem are much more likely to procrastinate, regardless of how good\nthey are at time management. However, it's a common misconception\nthat all procrastinators are lazy. In the body and brain, laziness is marked\nby no energy and general apathy. When you’re feeling lazy, you’re more\nlikely to sit around doing nothing than distract yourself \nwith unimportant tasks. In fact, many people procrastinate\nbecause they care too much. Procrastinators often report\na high fear of failure, putting things off because they’re afraid\ntheir work won’t live up to their high standards. Whatever the reason for procrastination, \nthe results are often the same. Frequent procrastinators are likely \nto suffer from anxiety and depression, ongoing feelings of shame, higher stress levels and physical ailments\nassociated with high stress. Worst of all, while procrastination\nhurts us in the long run, it does temporarily reduce\nour stress level, reinforcing it as a bodily response\nfor coping with stressful tasks. So, how can we break the cycle\nof procrastination? Traditionally, people thought \nprocrastinators needed to cultivate discipline and practice \nstrict time management. But today, many researchers\nfeel the exact opposite. Being too hard on yourself can layer\nadditional bad emotions onto a task, making the threat even more intense. To short-circuit this stress response, we need to address and reduce\nthese negative emotions. Some simple strategies include breaking\na task into smaller elements or journaling about why\nit's stressing you out and addressing those underlying concerns. Try removing nearby distractions that make\nit easy to impulsively procrastinate. And more than anything, it helps to\ncultivate an attitude of self-compassion, forgiving yourself,\nand making a plan to do better next time. Because a culture that perpetuates\nthis cycle of stress and procrastination hurts all of us in the long term."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is procrastination?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prioritizing certain tasks over others"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Refusing to complete certain tasks for ethical reasons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Making a poorly organized schedule for completing tasks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Avoiding certain tasks for no good reason "}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Procrastination is the result of our bodies trying to ____ us.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sabotage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Protect"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Harm"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Desensitize"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which part of the brain is responsible for the fear response associated with procrastination?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prefrontal cortex"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hippocampus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Amygdala"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pituitary gland"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these groups of people are most likely to be procrastinators?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "People who struggle with self-control and impulsivity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "People who struggle with low self-esteem and emotional regulation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "People who struggle with low energy and general apathy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "People who struggle with insomnia and dietary balance"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why have many researchers come to believe that strict discipline is not an effective way to combat procrastination?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Being too hard on yourself can make the task at hand feel more threatening."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rigid schedules are too often subject to change."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It's impossible to discipline oneself."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Procrastination is a genetically inherited trait."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 81, "lesson": 2, "title": "Why people believe they can't draw - Graham Shaw", "category": "The Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-people-believe-they-can-t-draw-graham-shaw", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Tijana Mihajlović\nReviewer: Mile Živković Hi. I've got a question for you: how many people here\nwould say they can draw? (Laughter) I think we've got about one or two percent\nof the hands going up, and it's interesting, isn't it? It's a little bit like people think\nof spelling or singing. They think,\"You can either\ndo it, or you can't.\" But I think you can. Because when people say they can't draw, I think it's more to do with beliefs\nrather than talent and ability. So I think when you say you can't draw,\nthat's just an illusion, and today I'd like to prove that to you. When I say \"draw\", I'm not saying we're all going\nto draw like Michelangelo. We are not going to be painting\nthe Sistine Chapel's ceiling. But would you be happy if,\nby the end of this session, you could draw pictures\na little bit like this? (Audience murmuring) Oh, yes! (Laughter) Or even a little bit like this? (Laughter) Actually, there are only two things\nyou need to do to be able to achieve this. One is have an open mind.\nAre you up for that? (Audience) Yes! And two, just be prepared to have a go. So grab a pen and a piece of paper. OK, so here's how it's going to work: I’ll show you the first cartoon\nwe're going to do, so just watch to begin with. Here we go. Just watching. That's going to be our first cartoon. It's a character called Spike. I'd like you to draw along with me. I'll draw the first line, you draw,\nand when you've done that, look up, and I'll know you're ready\nfor the next line. Okay, here we go. Start with the nose. Now the eyes. They're like 66s or speech marks. That's it. Next, the mouth. Nice, big smile. Now, over here, the ear. Next, some spiky hair. Next, put the pen to the left\nto the mouth, little line like that. Pen under the ear, drop a line like that. Pen to the left of the neck,\ntop of the T-shirt. Line to the left, line to the right. Just hold your drawings up\nand show everyone. (Laughter) How are we all doing? (Laughter) OK. OK, fantastic. So, it looks like you've just learned\nto draw one cartoon, but you've actually learned\nmore than that; you've learned a sequence\nthat would enable you to draw hundreds and thousands\nof different cartoons, because we're just going to do\nlittle variations on that sequence. Have a go at this. Draw along with me. Nose. Eyes. Smile. That's it. Now some hair. Pen to the left of the mouth, under the hair, little V-shape for the top, line to the left, line to the right. So we've got another character.\nLet's call her Thelma. (Laughter) So, we've got Spike and Thelma. Let's try another one. Here we go. Another little variation.\nYou're getting the idea. Starting with the nose. But this time we'll change\nthe eyes slightly. Look, two circles together like that. That's it. Then, two little dots in for the eyes. And this time we'll change\nthe mouth slightly. Watch. Little circle colored in there. Have a go at that. Next, the ear. Now, we'll have some fun\nwith the hair, watch. Nice curly hair. Then same thing: pen to the left\nto the mouth, little line like that. Under the ear, drop a line. Top of the T-shirt. Line to the left, line to the right. I think we'll call him Jeff. (Laughter) We'll do one more. One more go. Here we go. You're getting the idea. (Laughter) So we'll start with a nose again. Notice we're doing little variations. Now we'll change the eyes,\nso we've got them apart. We'll put some little dots in like that. Next, the mouth slightly different. Let's put a little V-shape like that. Triangle. And a little line across,\nand we'll just color this a little bit in. Now, watch this bit carefully;\nsome hair, watch. Here we go, little line like that. Next, a bit more there. And watch, a couple of triangles\nto make a little bow. Triangle at the bottom, rest of the hair. Pen to the left of the mouth again.\nYou get the idea. Drop a line for the neck. Now the V-shape. Line to the left, line to the right. There we go. Let's call her Pam. (Laughter) So you've done... (Laughter) So you've done four cartoons.\nYou can have a little rest now. (Laughter) Take a rest. You're getting the idea.\nAll we're doing is little variations. I'll just demonstrate a couple to you. We could go on all day, couldn't we? You could do someone\nlooking unhappy, a bit like that, or you could experiment with,\nperhaps, someone who is… just draw a straight line,\nsomeone looking a bit fed up. Or perhaps, you could do anything\nyou like, really, just try things out. Look at this. Little squiggle.\nThere we are. So, all sorts of things we could do. Actually, one more I'll let you do,\none more idea. This is a great little technique. Have a go at this: people with glasses on. Just draw a nose a bit like Spike's. Next, draw some frames, so two circles like that\nwith a little bit in between. Now, just put some dots\ninside for the eyes like that. Next, the ear. So it's little bit like we did before,\nbut this time we'll join up the frames. That's it. Watch this bit. (Laughter) And this bit I really like. Watch. (Laughter) And then, little bit there. Pencil under the mustache, line down, top of the shirt, left and right. So there we have it.\nWe could carry on, couldn't we? Hopefully, we've done enough\nto convince you that in fact we can all draw. And not just people here.\nI've worked with… I'm going to give you three examples\nof other people who've learned to draw, and that actually surprised them, too. I'm going to save\nwhat I think is my favorite, most surprising example until last. The first example is: I've worked a lot with children\nand students in schools. Actually the little ones,\nthey just draw fine, but when they get to about 15 or 16,\nmost of them think they can't draw. But I worked with them. I worked this week in a school where I was coaching them\non using pictures for memory. A girl was trying to remember\nwhat red blood cells do, and she drew this little picture of a red blood cell\ncarrying a handbag with O2 on it to remind her that the red blood cells\ncarry oxygen to all parts of the body. That was a great one. The other people I worked with\nare many adults in all walks of life, and particularly in business, and they often will want\nto make presentations memorable. So again, a quick cartoon or sketch\ncould be really good for that. And again, most people think\nthey can't draw, but take this example. Couple of wavy lines, little boat could be a metaphor\nto represent we're all in this together. So that, if that was just drawn\nin the presentation, would really stay\nin the memory, wouldn't it? Yeah. But the third example is -\nyou shouldn't have favorites, should you? This is my favorite. Have you ever been at the party\nwhen someone asks you what you do? It gets a little bit skeptical\nwhen people ask me that. This lady said to me, well - I said, \"I do a little bit of training,\nand I teach people to draw,\" and she said, \"Would you come along\nand do some for our group?\" She said, \"I work with some people\"\n- she was a volunteer - a group of people\nwho have suffered strokes. So I said, \"Sure, I could spare\nsome time for that.\" So I said I would,\nand I booked the time in. Have you ever done that? You get near of that time and you think,\n\"What have I let myself in for here?\" \"Will I be able to do it?\" I thought, \"What could I\ndo with them?\" you see. \"I know. I'll do my cartoon drawing.\nThey'll like that.\" But then, as I got near of the time,\nI got more apprehensive, because then I was thinking, \"I've worked with children,\nwith all sorts of adults; I've never worked with a group like this.\" It turns out it was all part\nof a charity called TALK. This TALK charity is a wonderful charity\nthat helps people who've suffered strokes, but have a particular condition\nknown as aphasia. You might have heard of aphasia,\nsometimes called dysphasia. The key thing is it affects\ntheir ability to communicate. So, for example, they might have trouble reading, writing, speaking,\nor understanding. It can be quite an isolating condition; it can be very, very frustrating\nand can lead to a loss of confidence. Anyway, so I prepared all this stuff,\nwhat to do for this session - for a couple of hours,\ntea break in the middle - and I got more apprehensive. But actually, I needn't have worried, because I'm going to show you now\nthe work that they did. It was one of the best things\nI've ever done. I'm going to show you the first slide. I taught them Spike,\njust like I did for you, and I want you to see the reaction\non their faces when they did this. (Audience) Oh. What you can see here\nare two of the stroke recoverers on the left and right, and one of the volunteer\nhelpers in the center. Each stroke recoverer, there are about 36\nin the room with volunteers as well, there's one-to-one helpers. You can just see the delight\non their faces, can't you? Let's look at another picture. This is a gentleman called David,\nand he's holding up his picture, and you can tell it was the picture\nof Spike, can't you? In fact, I think he's drawn Spike\neven better there. But what I didn't realize\nuntil even after the session was that the number of the people\nin this session, including David, were drawing with their wrong hand. David's stroke meant that it affected\nthe right side of his body, and he drew with his left hand,\nas many did. Nobody mentioned it to me,\nnobody complained. They just got on with it. It was an inspirational session for me. It was quite a humbling session, one of the best things\nI felt I've ever done. At the end of it, I had a lovely email\nfrom doctor Mike Jordan, and he's the chair of the TALK group; happens to be a medical doctor,\nbut he's the chair of the group. He wrote to me, and I'm quoting, he said, \"Our recoverers learned today\nthat they can draw. It's a bit more than that; this sort of activity\nreally builds their confidence.\" So I was happy, he was happy,\neveryone was happy, they've invited me back again, and I go in there now\nabout every three or four months. So it's great. I thought\nthat was a lovely example to share. Fancy one more drawing? (Audience) Yes. Here we go. Grab your pens. Here we go. Right. I'm going to get you to draw someone\nthat you would recognize. So start with a big nose,\na bit like Spike's. Next, we'll do some eyes,\nand you might be thinking, \"This is also a bit like Spike.\" Watch the next bit. You're getting warm. There you go. Little line down there. Down here. Little V-shape,\nline to the left, line to the right. And you've got Albert Einstein. (Laughter) So you've got the pens with you, you've proved that you can draw. You're very welcome\nto take the pens with you and have a practice at home, even show somebody else. But actually, I'd like to leave you\nwith a final thought. When you walked in here today, many of you didn't believe\nyou could draw. I've got a question for you about that. How many other beliefs\nand limiting thoughts do we all carry around with us every day? Beliefs that we could perhaps\npotentially challenge and think differently about. If we did challenge those beliefs\nand think differently about them, apart from drawing, what else\nwould be possible for us all? Thank you very much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 81, "lesson": 3, "title": "The benefits of a bilingual brain - Mia Nacamulli", "category": "Growth & Development", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-speaking-multiple-languages-benefits-the-brain-mia-nacamulli", "transcript": {"en": "¿Hablas español? Parlez-vous français? \n你会说中文吗？ If you answered, \"sí,\" \"oui,\" or \"会\"\nand you're watching this in English, chances are you belong to the world's\nbilingual and multilingual majority. And besides having \nan easier time traveling or watching movies without subtitles, knowing two or more languages\nmeans that your brain may actually look and work differently\nthan those of your monolingual friends. So what does it really \nmean to know a language? Language ability is typically measured\nin two active parts, speaking and writing, and two passive parts, \nlistening and reading. While a balanced bilingual has near equal abilities across the board \nin two languages, most bilinguals around the world\nknow and use their languages in varying proportions. And depending on their situation\nand how they acquired each language, they can be classified into\nthree general types. For example, let's take Gabriella, whose family immigrates to the US \nfrom Peru when she's two-years old. As a compound bilingual, Gabriella develops two linguistic \ncodes simultaneously, with a single set of concepts, learning both English and Spanish as she begins to process \nthe world around her. Her teenage brother, on the other hand,\nmight be a coordinate bilingual, working with two sets of concepts, learning English in school, while continuing to speak Spanish\nat home and with friends. Finally, Gabriella's parents are likely\nto be subordinate bilinguals who learn a secondary language by filtering it through\ntheir primary language. Because all types of bilingual people\ncan become fully proficient in a language regardless of accent or pronunciation, the difference may not be apparent\nto a casual observer. But recent advances \nin brain imaging technology have given neurolinguists a glimpse into how specific aspects of language\nlearning affect the bilingual brain. It's well known that the brain's\nleft hemisphere is more dominant and analytical in logical processes, while the right hemisphere is more active\nin emotional and social ones, though this is a matter of degree,\nnot an absolute split. The fact that language involves\nboth types of functions while lateralization develops\ngradually with age, has lead to the critical \nperiod hypothesis. According to this theory, children learn languages more easily because the plasticity \nof their developing brains lets them use both hemispheres\nin language acquisition, while in most adults, language \nis lateralized to one hemisphere, usually the left. If this is true, learning a language\nin childhood may give you a more holistic grasp\nof its social and emotional contexts. Conversely, recent research showed that people who learned \na second language in adulthood exhibit less emotional bias\nand a more rational approach when confronting problems\nin the second language than in their native one. But regardless of when you acquire\nadditional languages, being multilingual gives your brain\nsome remarkable advantages. Some of these are even visible, such as higher density of the grey matter that contains most of your brain's \nneurons and synapses, and more activity in certain regions\nwhen engaging a second language. The heightened workout a bilingual\nbrain receives throughout its life can also help delay the onset of diseases,\nlike Alzheimer's and dementia by as much as five years. The idea of major cognitive \nbenefits to bilingualism may seem intuitive now, but it would have surprised \nearlier experts. Before the 1960s, bilingualism\nwas considered a handicap that slowed a child's development by forcing them to spend too much energy\ndistinguishing between languages, a view based largely on flawed studies. And while a more recent study did show that reaction times and errors increase\nfor some bilingual students in cross-language tests, it also showed that the effort\nand attention needed to switch between languages\ntriggered more activity in, and potentially strengthened,\nthe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This is the part of the brain\nthat plays a large role in executive function, problem solving,\nswitching between tasks, and focusing while filtering out\nirrelevant information. So, while bilingualism may not\nnecessarily make you smarter, it does make your brain more healthy,\ncomplex and actively engaged, and even if you didn't have \nthe good fortune of learning a second language as a child, it's never too late to do \nyourself a favor and make the linguistic \nleap from, \"Hello,\" to, \"Hola,\" \"Bonjour\" or \"你好’s\" because when it comes to our brains\na little exercise can go a long way."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Language ability is typically measured in what parts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Conjugation and expanse of vocabulary"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Talking, writing, listening and reading"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pronunciation and sentence structure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Accent, speed and spelling"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A person who learns French and English simultaneously from childhood onward would be considered which type of bilingual?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Subordinate bilingual"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Coordinate bilingual"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Compound bilingual"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The fact that language involves functions both typical of the left and right hemispheres while lateralization develops gradually with age has led to which hypothesis?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Critical Period Hypothesis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Critical Mass Hypothesis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Compound Bilingual Hypothesis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Early Lateralization Hypothesis"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

It tugs at your intestines, \nwhich begin to writhe, aching to be fed. Being hungry generates a powerful,\noften unpleasant physical sensation that's almost impossible to ignore. After you've reacted by gorging\non your morning pancakes, you start to experience \nan opposing force, fullness, but how does your body actually know\nwhen you're full? The sensation of fullness is set in motion\nas food moves from your mouth down your esophagus. Once it hits your stomach,\nit gradually fills the space. That causes the surrounding\nmuscular wall to stretch, expanding slowly like a balloon. A multitude of nerves wrapped\nintricately around the stomach wall sense the stretching. They communicate with the vagus nerve\nup to the brainstem and hypothalamus, the main parts of the brain\nthat control food intake. But that's just one input your brain uses\nto sense fullness. After all, if you fill \nyour stomach with water, you won't feel full for long. Your brain also takes into account\nchemical messengers in the form of hormones produced\nby endocrine cells throughout your digestive system. These respond to the presence of specific\nnutrients in your gut and bloodstream, which gradually increase \nas you digest your food. As the hormones seep out, \nthey're swept up by the blood and eventually reach the hypothalamus\nin the brain. Over 20 gastrointestinal hormones \nare involved in moderating our appetites. One example is cholecystokinin, which is produced in response to food\nby cells in the upper small bowel. When it reached the hypothalamus, it causes a reduction in the feeling\nof reward you get when you eat food. When that occurs, the sense\nof being satiated starts to sink in and you stop eating. Cholecystokinin also slows down\nthe movement of food from the stomach into the intestines. That makes your stomach stretch\nmore over a period of time, allowing your body to register\nthat you're filling up. This seems to be why when you eat slowly,\nyou actually feel fuller compared to when you consume your food\nat lightning speed. When you eat quickly, your body doesn't\nhave time to recognize the state it's in. Once nutrients and gastrointestinal\nhormones are present in the blood, they trigger the pancreas\nto release insulin. Insulin stimulates the body's fat cells\nto make another hormone called leptin. Leptin reacts with receptors\non neuron populations in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus has two sets of neurons\nimportant for our feeling of hunger. One set produces the sensation of hunger\nby making and releasing certain proteins. The other set inhibits hunger through\nits own set of compounds. Leptin inhibits the hypothalamus neurons\nthat drive food intake and stimulates the neurons \nthat suppress it. By this point, your body has reached\npeak fullness. Through the constant exchange \nof information between hormones, the vagus nerve, the brainstem, and the different portions \nof hypothalamus, your brain gets the signal\nthat you've eaten enough. Researchers have discovered that some foods produce \nmore long-lasting fullness than others. For instance, boiled potatoes are ranked as some of the most \nhunger-satisfying foods, while croissants \nare particularly unsatisfying. In general, foods with more protein,\nfiber, and water tend to keep hunger at bay for longer. But feeling full won't last forever. After a few hours, your gut and brain\nbegin their conversation again. Your empty stomach produces\nother hormones, such as ghrelin, that increase the activity of \nthe hunger-causing nerve cells in the hypothalamus. Eventually, the growling beast of hunger\nis reawakened.

There is something that we know about everyone we meet\nanywhere in the world, on the street, that is the very mainspring\nof whatever they do and whatever they put up with. And that is that all of us\nwant to be happy. In this, we are all together. How we imagine our happiness,\nthat differs from one another, but it's already a lot\nthat we have all in common, that we want to be happy. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection\nbetween happiness and gratefulness? Many people would say,\nwell, that's very easy. When you are happy, you are grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people\nthat are grateful? We all know quite a number of people who have everything\nthat it would take to be happy, and they are not happy, because they want something else\nor they want more of the same. And we all know people\nwho have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves\nwould not want to have, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why? Because they are grateful. So it is not happiness\nthat makes us grateful. It's gratefulness that makes us happy. If you think it's happiness\nthat makes you grateful, think again. It's gratefulness that makes you happy. Now, we can ask, what do we really mean by gratefulness? And how does it work? I appeal to your own experience. We all know from experience how it goes. We experience something\nthat's valuable to us. Something is given to us\nthat's valuable to us. And it's really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable,\nand it's a real gift. You haven't bought it.\nYou haven't earned it. You haven't traded it in.\nYou haven't worked for it. It's just given to you. And when these two things come together, something that's really valuable to me\nand I realize it's freely given, then gratefulness spontaneously\nrises in my heart, happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That's how gratefulness happens. Now the key to all this is that we cannot only\nexperience this once in a while. We cannot only have grateful experiences. We can be people who live gratefully. Grateful living, that is the thing. And how can we live gratefully? By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment\nis a given moment, as we say. It's a gift. You haven't earned it. You haven't brought it about in any way. You have no way of assuring that there will be\nanother moment given to you, and yet, that's the most valuable thing\nthat can ever be given to us, this moment, with all the opportunity\nthat it contains. If we didn't have this present moment, we wouldn't have\nany opportunity to do anything or experience anything, and this moment is a gift. It's a given moment, as we say. Now, we say the gift within this gift\nis really the opportunity. What you are really grateful for\nis the opportunity, not the thing that is given to you, because if that thing were somewhere else and you didn't have\nthe opportunity to enjoy it, to do something with it, you wouldn't be grateful for it. Opportunity is the gift within every gift, and we have this saying,\nopportunity knocks only once. Well, think again. Every moment is a new gift,\nover and over again, and if you miss the opportunity\nof this moment, another moment is given to us,\nand another moment. We can avail ourselves\nof this opportunity, or we can miss it, and if we avail ourselves\nof the opportunity, it is the key to happiness. Behold the master key to our happiness in our own hands. Moment by moment,\nwe can be grateful for this gift. Does that mean that we can be grateful for everything? Certainly not. We cannot be grateful\nfor violence, for war, for oppression, for exploitation. On the personal level,\nwe cannot be grateful for the loss of a friend,\nfor unfaithfulness, for bereavement. But I didn't say\nwe can be grateful for everything. I said we can be grateful\nin every given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted\nwith something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity\nthat is given to us. It isn't as bad as it might seem. Actually, when you look at it\nand experience it, you find that most of the time, what is given to us\nis the opportunity to enjoy, and we only miss it\nbecause we are rushing through life and we are not stopping\nto see the opportunity. But once in a while, something very difficult is given to us, and when this difficult thing\noccurs to us, it's a challenge to rise\nto that opportunity, and we can rise to it\nby learning something which is sometimes painful. Learning patience, for instance. We have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint,\nbut is more like a marathon. That takes patience. That's difficult. It may be to stand up for your opinion,\nto stand up for your conviction. That's an opportunity that is given to us. To learn, to suffer, to stand up, all these opportunities are given to us, but they are opportunities, and those who avail themselves\nof those opportunities are the ones that we admire. They make something out of life. And those who fail\nget another opportunity. We always get another opportunity. That's the wonderful richness of life. So how can we find a method\nthat will harness this? How can each one of us find a method\nfor living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful, but moment by moment to be grateful. How can we do it?\nIt's a very simple method. It's so simple that it's actually\nwhat we were told as children when we learned to cross the street. Stop. Look. Go. That's all. But how often do we stop? We rush through life. We don't stop. We miss the opportunity\nbecause we don't stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build\nstop signs into our lives. When I was in Africa\nsome years ago and then came back, I noticed water. In Africa where I was,\nI didn't have drinkable water. Every time I turned on the faucet,\nI was overwhelmed. Every time I clicked on the light,\nI was so grateful. It made me so happy. But after a while, this wears off. So I put little stickers\non the light switch and on the water faucet, and every time I turned it on, water. So leave it up to your own imagination. You can find whatever works best for you, but you need stop signs in your life. And when you stop, then the next thing is to look. You look. You open your eyes. You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this wonderful richness\nthat is given to us. There is no end to it,\nand that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts, our hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others, to make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy\nthan when all of us are happy. And when we open\nour hearts to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us\nto do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go,\nand really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers to you\nin that present moment. Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy, but sometimes\nit's something more difficult. But whatever it is,\nif we take this opportunity, we go with it, we are creative,\nthose are the creative people. And that little stop, look, go, is such a potent seed that it can revolutionize our world. Because we are at the present moment in the middle of a change\nof consciousness, and you will be surprised if you -- I am always surprised\nwhen I hear how many times this word \"gratefulness\"\nand \"gratitude\" comes up. Everywhere you find it, a grateful airline,\na restaurant gratefulness, a café gratefulness,\na wine that is gratefulness. Yes, I have even come across\na toilet paper whose brand is called \"Thank You.\" (Laughter) There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware\nhow important this is and how this can change our world. It can change our world\nin immensely important ways, because if you're grateful,\nyou're not fearful, and if you're not fearful,\nyou're not violent. If you're grateful,\nyou act out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity, and you are willing to share. If you are grateful, you are enjoying\nthe differences between people, and you are respectful to everybody, and that changes this power pyramid\nunder which we live. And it doesn't make for equality,\nbut it makes for equal respect, and that is the important thing. The future of the world will be a network, not a pyramid turned upside down. The revolution of which I am speaking\nis a nonviolent revolution, and it's so revolutionary\nthat it even revolutionizes the very concept of a revolution, because the normal revolution is one where the power pyramid\nis turned upside down and those who were on the bottom\nare now on the top and are doing exactly the same thing\nthat the ones before. What we need is a networking\nof smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups\nwho know one another, who interact with one another,\nand that is a grateful world. A grateful world\nis a world of joyful people. Grateful people are joyful people, and joyful people -- the more and more joyful people there are, the more and more\nwe'll have a joyful world. We have a network for grateful living,\nand it has mushroomed. We couldn't understand why it mushroomed. We have an opportunity\nfor people to light a candle when they are grateful for something. And there have been\n15 million candles lit in one decade. People are becoming aware\nthat a grateful world is a happy world, and we all have the opportunity\nby the simple stop, look, go, to transform the world,\nto make it a happy place. And that is what I hope for us, and if this has contributed a little\nto making you want to do the same, stop, look, go. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But the longer you stay put,\nthe more agitated your body becomes. It sits there counting down the moments\nuntil you stand up again and take it for a walk. That may sound ridiculous. Our bodies love to sit, right? Not really. Sure, sitting for brief periods \ncan help us recover from stress or recuperate from exercise. But nowadays, our lifestyles make us sit\nmuch more than we move around, and our bodies simply aren't built\nfor such a sedentary existence. In fact, just the opposite is true. The human body is built to move, and you can see evidence of that\nin the way it's structured. Inside us are over 360 joints,\nand about 700 skeletal muscles that enable easy, fluid motion. The body's unique physical structure\ngives us the ability to stand up straight against the pull of gravity. Our blood depends on us moving around\nto be able to circulate properly. Our nerve cells benefit from movement, and our skin is elastic, \nmeaning it molds to our motions. So if every inch of the body\nis ready and waiting for you to move, what happens when you just don't? Let's start with the backbone\nof the problem, literally. Your spine is a long structure made of bones and the cartilage discs\nthat sit between them. Joints, muscles and ligaments\nthat are attached to the bones hold it all together. A common way of sitting is with a\ncurved back and slumped shoulders, a position that puts uneven\npressure on your spine. Over time, this causes wear and tear\nin your spinal discs, overworks certain ligaments and joints, and puts strain on muscles that stretch to accommodate \nyour back's curved position. This hunched shape also shrinks\nyour chest cavity while you sit, meaning your lungs have less space\nto expand into when you breath. That's a problem because it temporarily\nlimits the amount of oxygen that fills your lungs\nand filters into your blood. Around the skeleton are the muscles,\nnerves, arteries and veins that form the body's soft tissue layers. The very act of sitting squashes,\npressurizes and compresses, and these more delicate tissues\nreally feel the brunt. Have you ever experienced numbness\nand swelling in your limbs when you sit? In areas that are the most compressed, your nerves, arteries and veins\ncan become blocked, which limits nerve signaling,\ncausing the numbness, and reduces blood flow in your limbs,\ncausing them to swell. Sitting for long periods also temporarily\ndeactivates lipoprotein lipase, a special enzyme in the walls\nof blood capillaries that breaks down fats in the blood, so when you sit, you're not burning fat\nnearly as well as when you move around. What effect does all of this stasis\nhave on the brain? Most of the time, \nyou probably sit down to use your brain, but ironically, lengthy periods of sitting\nactually run counter to this goal. Being stationary reduces blood flow and the amount of oxygen entering\nyour blood stream through your lungs. Your brain requires both \nof those things to remain alert, so your concentration levels\nwill most likely dip as your brain activity slows. Unfortunately, the ill effects of being\nseated don't only exist in the short term. Recent studies have found \nthat sitting for long periods is linked with some types of cancers\nand heart disease and can contribute to diabetes,\nkidney and liver problems. In fact, researchers \nhave worked out that, worldwide, inactivity causes about \n9% of premature deaths a year. That's over 5 million people. So what seems like such a harmless habit actually has the power \nto change our health. But luckily, the solutions to this\nmounting threat are simple and intuitive. When you have no choice but to sit, try switching the slouch \nfor a straighter spine, and when you don't have \nto be bound to your seat, aim to move around much more, perhaps by setting a reminder\nto yourself to get up every half hour. But mostly, just appreciate that bodies\nare built for motion, not for stillness. In fact, since the video's almost over,\nwhy not stand up and stretch right now? Treat your body to a walk. It'll thank you later."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Our bodily systems are designed for and in need of movement.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Sitting is necessary for resting.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If I exercise 30 minutes a daily, the negative effects of sitting at work will be diminished.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Keeping spine actively straight in sitting is the best way of avoiding injuries.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Sitting may help your brain function better.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 81, "lesson": 7, "title": "Are multivitamins really good for you?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/lR3GxuW6", "transcript": {"en": "(intro song) From colorful pills to chewy gummies in the shape of your favorite cartoon character There are tons of multivitamin supplements to choose from and people spend billions of dollars every year trying to boost their health with them. But if you look on the back of the bottle lots of these supplements have more than 100%. Sometimes up to 500% or 2000% of the recommended daily value for different vitamins inside. So, why are they so jam-packed with vitamins? And is taking all these supplements actually good for you? Well, if you are healthy and eating a balanced diet, you should be getting all the vitamins you need. So at best, they probably aren't doing very much. At worst, they could be doing you harm. Vitamins are important compounds that our bodies need to grow and function. But we need to get them from food because we can't make them, or enough of them, ourselves. There are fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K which means they dissolve in lipids and B vitamins and Vitamin C are water-soluble which means they dissolve in water. And different vitamins come from different foods. Vitamin K, for example, can come from dark green vegetables, while Vitamin C is in all kinds of citrus fruits, and your body can vitamin D after spending some time in the sun. If you're deficient in any of them, your cells and enzymes won't be able to work properly, and you could be prone to diseases. So the reason to taking multi-vitamin supplements is usually to prevent any vitamin deficiencies. Sounds reasonable. But taking supplements when you don't actually need them can cause problems. Multi-vitamins generally have more than 100% of your Recommended Dietary Allowance, or RDA. RDA values are set by national organizations that study food and nutrition. They're basically the estimated nutrient requirements for healthy people. The same scientific committees also estimate a tolerable Upper intake Level, or UL which is the max amount of these nutrients you can take, without risking some negative health effects. Generally, the levels for water-soluble vitamins are a lot higher than for fat-soluable vitamins. Either way, when you take a multivitamin that has more than 100% of the RDA for different vitamins, your body might not be digesting and absorbing it all. Your body tends to get rid of any excess water-soluble vitamins by peeing them out. But it stores the extra fat-soluble vitamins in your fatty tissues. The problem is megadoses of vitamins. If you consistently take the UL dose over weeks or months, especially with fat-soluble vitamins, these vitamins will keep building up in your body, and eventually cause toxicity or other health problems. For example, Vitamin D normally helps your body absorb calcium but a lot Vitamin D could cause a buildup of calcium in your blood called Hypercalcemia or even damage your heart. So even though your body needs vitamins to survive, taking multivitamins doesn't replace the nutrients you get from a balanced diet, and can even be harmful if you overdo it. If you have some sort of health condition, or pregnant, definitely listen to your doctor and the supplements they recommend. But, usually just taking a bunch of extra multivitamins won't do much for your health. Thanks to Patreon patreon Richard Willis for asking this question.

{"page": 81, "lesson": 8, "title": "4 things all great listeners know", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/4-things-all-great-listeners-know", "transcript": {"en": "It's easy to tell when someone's\nnot paying attention, but it can be surprisingly tricky to know\nwhat truly excellent listening looks like. Behavioral scientists have found\nthat good listening is one of the most important things \nwe can do to improve our relationships, develop our worldview, and potentially\neven change people's minds. So, what can we do to become\nbetter listeners? At its core, listening in a one-on-one\nconversation is about taking an interest in another person \nand making them feel understood. There’s no universally agreed \nupon definition of high-quality listening, but some recurring features include\nattentiveness, conveying understanding, and showing a positive intention\ntowards the speaker. This doesn’t mean you can simply\ngo through the motions— researchers have found\nthat merely smiling and nodding at set intervals doesn’t quite work. However, there is something slightly\nperformative about listening in that it’s important to show \nyou’re doing it. So, in addition to actively attending\nto a speaker’s words, good listeners also use questions\nand body language that indicate their understanding\nand their desire to understand. This might feel awkward at first, and what’s most effective might depend\non your relationship with the speaker. But with time and practice you can\ninternalize these basic behaviors. So let’s say a good friend wants\nto tell you about an issue they’re having with their partner. Before even starting your conversation, remove any distractions \nin the environment. Turn off the TV, take off your headphones \nand put your phone away— far away. One study showed that even\nthe visible presence of a phone made conversations feel less\nintimate and fulfilling to those involved. Once the conversation begins, one of the most important things \nyou can do is also the most obvious— try not to interrupt. This doesn’t mean\nyou need to stay completely silent. But if you do interject, \nlook for natural pauses to ask open-ended questions\nthat benefit the speaker, not just your curiosity. Questions like “What happened next?”\nor “How did that make you feel?” confirm that you’re following\nthe story while also helping the speaker dive deeper into their own thoughts. Another great way to show your\nunderstanding is by summarizing what you just heard \nand asking if you’ve missed anything. Summaries like this show the speaker that\nyou're truly trying to understand them rather than just waiting\nfor your turn to talk. Speaking of which, while a good\nconversation requires back and forth, planning out your response \nwhile the speaker is talking is a common way to miss what’s being said. So try to stay present \nand if you lose focus, don't be shy about asking the speaker\nto repeat what you missed. This might feel embarrassing, but asking for clarification actually\nshows that you’re committed to understanding. Finally, don’t be afraid of silence. It’s okay to ask for a moment to formulate\nyour response and taking a beat to think can help \nspeakers reflect on their speech as well. These might seem like small changes, \nbut together they make a big difference. And when people feel heard, \nthey report more satisfaction, trust, and connection \nin their relationships. In the workplace, employees who feel heard\ngenerally experience less burnout, and perceive the managers who listened\nto them more favorably. Unfortunately, while it might be\neasy to listen to some people, it can be hard to muster all\nthis focus and attention if you disagree with \nor dislike the speaker. But these situations might actually\nbenefit most from your efforts to listen openly. The theory of psychological reactance\nsuggests that trying to force someone to change their mind makes them\nmore likely to defend their point of view. However, recent studies suggest \nthat high-quality listening fosters open-mindedness by creating \na non-judgmental and psychologically safe environment. Of course, truly open-minded listening\nisn’t about changing people’s minds. Good listening is not \nthe same as agreeing, and conversations don’t have \nto end with a happy resolution. But even during a disagreement, sometimes being heard is enough \nto start a deeper conversation."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Listening in a one-on-one conversation should be about ___", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Formulating a strong rebuttal."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Making the speaker feel understood."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Changing the speaker's mind."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pretending to take interest in another person.

So while those early adopters\nwere lined up outside, waiting to get their hands\non this amazing new gadget, I was stuck at home\nwith my hands full of something else that was sending out\nconstant notifications -- (Laughter) a miserable, colicky baby who would only sleep in a moving stroller\nwith complete silence. I literally was walking\n10 to 15 miles a day, and the baby weight came off. That part was great. But man, was I bored. Before motherhood, I had been a journalist who rushed off when the Concorde crashed. I was one of the first\npeople into Belgrade when there was a revolution in Serbia. Now, I was exhausted. This walking went on for weeks. It was only until about three months in\nthat something shifted, though. As I pounded the pavement, my mind started to wander, too. I began imagining what I would do\nwhen I finally did sleep again. So the colic did fade, and I finally got an iPhone and I put all those hours\nof wandering into action. I created my dream job\nhosting a public radio show. So there was no more\nrushing off to war zones, but thanks to my new smartphone, I could be a mother and a journalist. I could be on the playground\nand on Twitter at the same time. Yeah, well, when I thought that, when the technology came in and took over, that is when I hit a wall. So, I want you to picture this: you host a podcast, and you have to prove that the investment\nof precious public radio dollars in you is worth it. My goal was to increase\nmy audience size tenfold. So one day, I sat down to brainstorm, as you do, and I came up barren. This was different\nthan writer's block, right? It wasn't like there was something there\nwaiting to be unearthed. There was just nothing. And so I started to think back: When was the last time\nI actually had a good idea? Yeah, it was when I was pushing\nthat damn stroller. Now all the cracks in my day\nwere filled with phone time. I checked the headlines\nwhile I waited for my latte. I updated my calendar\nwhile I was sitting on the couch. Texting turned every spare moment into a chance to show to my coworkers\nand my dear husband what a responsive person I was, or at least it was a chance to find\nanother perfect couch for my page on Pinterest. I realized that I was never bored. And anyway, don't only\nboring people get bored? But then I started to wonder: What actually happens to us\nwhen we get bored? Or, more importantly: What happens to us\nif we never get bored? And what could happen if we got rid of\nthis human emotion entirely? I started talking to neuroscientists\nand cognitive psychologists, and what they told me was fascinating. It turns out that when you get bored, you ignite a network in your brain\ncalled the \"default mode.\" So our body, it goes on autopilot\nwhile we're folding the laundry or we're walking to work, but actually that is when our brain\ngets really busy. Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann. (Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann:\nOnce you start daydreaming and allow your mind to really wander, you start thinking a little bit\nbeyond the conscious, a little bit into the subconscious, which allows sort of different\nconnections to take place. It's really awesome, actually. Manoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right? So this is my brain in an fMRI, and I learned that in the default mode\nis when we connect disparate ideas, we solve some of our most\nnagging problems, and we do something called\n\"autobiographical planning.\" This is when we look back at our lives, we take note of the big moments,\nwe create a personal narrative, and then we set goals and we figure out what steps\nwe need to take to reach them. But now we chill out on the couch\nalso while updating a Google Doc or replying to email. We call it \"getting shit done,\" but here's what neuroscientist\nDr. Daniel Levitin says we're actually doing. (Audio) Dr. Daniel Levitin:\nEvery time you shift your attention from one thing to another, the brain has to engage\na neurochemical switch that uses up nutrients in the brain\nto accomplish that. So if you're attempting to multitask, you know, doing four\nor five things at once, you're not actually doing\nfour or five things at once, because the brain doesn't work that way. Instead, you're rapidly shifting\nfrom one thing to the next, depleting neural resources as you go. (Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch,\nyou're using glucose, glucose, glucose. (Audio) DL: Exactly right, and we have\na limited supply of that stuff. MZ: A decade ago, we shifted\nour attention at work every three minutes. Now we do it every 45 seconds, and we do it all day long. The average person checks email\n74 times a day, and switches tasks on their computer 566 times a day. I discovered all this\ntalking to professor of informatics, Dr. Gloria Mark. (Audio) Dr. Gloria Mark: So we find\nthat when people are stressed, they tend to shift\ntheir attention more rapidly. We also found, strangely enough, that the shorter the amount of sleep\nthat a person gets, the more likely they are\nto check Facebook. So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle. MZ: But could this cycle be broken? What would happen\nif we broke this vicious cycle? Maybe my listeners could help me find out. What if we reclaimed\nthose cracks in our day? Could it help us\njump-start our creativity? We called the project\n\"Bored and Brilliant.\" And I expected, you know,\na couple hundred people to play along, but thousands of people\nstarted signing up. And they told me the reason\nthey were doing it was because they were worried\nthat their relationship with their phone had grown kind of ...\n\"codependent,\" shall we say. (Audio) Man: The relationship\nbetween a baby and its teddy bear or a baby and its binky or a baby that wants its mother's cradle when it's done with being held\nby a stranger -- (Laughs) that's the relationship\nbetween me and my phone. (Audio) Woman: I think of my phone\nlike a power tool: extremely useful, but dangerous\nif I'm not handling it properly. (Audio) Woman 2:\nIf I don't pay close attention, I'll suddenly realize\nthat I've lost an hour of time doing something totally mindless. MZ: OK, but to really measure\nany improvement, we needed data, right? Because that's what we do these days. So we partnered with some apps\nthat would measure how much time we were spending every day on our phone. If you're thinking it's ironic that I asked people\nto download another app so that they would spend\nless time on their phones: yeah, but you gotta meet people\nwhere they are. (Laughter) So before challenge week, we were averaging two hours\na day on our phones and 60 pickups, you know, like, a quick check,\ndid I get a new email? Here's what Tina, a student\nat Bard College, discovered about herself. (Audio) Tina: So far, I've been spending between 150 and 200 minutes\non my phone per day, and I've been picking up my phone\n70 to 100 times per day. And it's really concerning, because that's so much time\nthat I could have spent doing something more productive,\nmore creative, more towards myself, because when I'm on my phone,\nI'm not doing anything important. MZ: Like Tina, people were starting\nto observe their own behavior. They were getting ready\nfor challenge week. And that Monday, they started to wake up\nto instructions in their inbox, an experiment to try. Day one: \"Put it in your pocket.\" Take that phone out of your hand. See if you can eliminate the reflex\nto check it all day long, just for a day. And if this sounds easy, you haven't tried it. Here's listener Amanda Itzko. (Audio) Amanda Itzko:\nI am absolutely itching. I feel a little bit crazy, because I have noticed\nthat I pick up my phone when I'm just walking\nfrom one room to another, getting on the elevator, and even -- and this is the part\nthat I am really embarrassed to actually say out loud -- in the car. MZ: Yikes. Yeah, well, but as Amanda learned, this itching feeling\nis not actually her fault. That is exactly the behavior\nthat the technology is built to trigger. (Laughter) I mean, right? Here's former Google designer,\nTristan Harris. (Audio) Tristan Harris: If I'm Facebook\nor I'm Netflix or I'm Snapchat, I have literally a thousand engineers whose job is to get\nmore attention from you. I'm very good at this, and I don't want you to ever stop. And you know, the CEO\nof Netflix recently said, \"Our biggest competitors\nare Facebook, YouTube and sleep.\" I mean, so there's a million places\nto spend your attention, but there's a war going on to get it. MZ: I mean, you know the feeling: that amazing episode\nof \"Transparent\" ends, and then the next one starts playing so you're like, eh, OK fine,\nI'll just stay up and watch it. Or the LinkedIn progress bar\nsays you are this close to having the perfect profile, so you add a little more\npersonal information. As one UX designer told me, the only people who refer\nto their customers as \"users\" are drug dealers and technologists. (Laughter) (Applause) And users, as we know,\nare worth a lot of money. Here's former Facebook\nproduct manager and author, Antonio García Martínez. (Audio) Antonio García Martínez:\nThe saying is, if any product is free then you're the product;\nyour attention is the product. But what is your attention worth? That's why literally every time\nyou load a page, not just on Facebook or any app, there's an auction being held instantly,\nbillions of times a day, for exactly how much\nthat one ad impression cost. MZ: By the way, the average person\nwill spend two years of their life on Facebook. So, back to challenge week. Immediately, we saw\nsome creativity kick in. Here's New Yorker Lisa Alpert. (Audio) Lisa Alpert: I was bored, I guess. So I suddenly looked at the stairway\nthat went up to the top of the station, and I thought, you know, I had just come down that stairway,\nbut I could go back up and then come back down\nand get a little cardio. So I did, and then I had a little more time,\nso I did it again and I did it again, and I did it 10 times. And I had a complete cardio workout. I got on that R train feeling\nkind of exhausted, but, like, wow,\nthat had never occurred to me. How is that possible? (Laughter) MZ: So creativity, I learned, means\ndifferent things to different people. (Laughter) But everyone found\nday three's challenge the hardest. It was called \"Delete that app.\" Take that app -- you know the one; that one that always gets you,\nit sucks you in -- take it off your phone, even if just for the day. I deleted the game Two Dots\nand nearly cried. (Laughter) Yeah, Two Dots players\nknow what I'm talking about. But my misery had good company. (Audio) Man 2: This is Liam\nin Los Angeles, and I deleted Twitter, Facebook,\nInstagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Vine from my phone in one fell swoop. And it was kind of an embarrassingly\nemotional experience at first. It felt weirdly lonely\nto look at that lock screen with no new notifications on it. But I really liked deciding for myself when to think about or access\nmy social networks, not giving my phone the power\nto decide that for me. So thank you. (Audio) Woman 3: Deleting the Twitter app\nwas very sad, and I feel I maybe, over the last year\nwhen I've been on Twitter, have developed an addiction to it, and this \"Bored and Brilliant\" challenge\nhas really made me realize it. After a brief period of really horrible\nwithdrawal feeling, like lack-of-caffeine headache, I now feel lovely. I had a lovely dinner with my family, and I hope to continue this structured use\nof these powerful tools. (Audio) Woman 4: I don't have\nthat guilty gut feeling I have when I know\nI'm wasting time on my phone. Maybe I'll have to start giving myself\nchallenges and reminders like this every morning. MZ: I mean, yes, this was progress. I could not wait to see\nwhat the numbers said at the end of that week. But when the data came in, it turned out that we had cut down, on average, just six minutes -- from 120 minutes a day on our phones to 114. Yeah. Whoop-de-do. So I went back to the scientists\nfeeling kind of low, and they just laughed at me, and they said, you know,\nchanging people's behavior in such a short time period was ridiculously ambitious, and actually what you've achieved\nis far beyond what we thought possible. Because more important than the numbers,\nwere the people's stories. They felt empowered. Their phones had been transformed from taskmasters back into tools. And actually, I found what\nthe young people said most intriguing. Some of them told me that they didn't recognize\nsome of the emotions that they felt during challenge week, because, if you think about it, if you have never known life\nwithout connectivity, you may never have experienced boredom. And there could be consequences. Researchers at USC have found --\nthey're studying teenagers who are on social media\nwhile they're talking to their friends or they're doing homework, and two years down the road,\nthey are less creative and imaginative about their own personal futures and about solving societal problems,\nlike violence in their neighborhoods. And we really need this next generation to be able to focus on some big problems: climate change, economic disparity, massive cultural differences. No wonder CEOs in an IBM survey identified creativity as the number one\nleadership competency. OK, here's the good news, though: In the end, 20,000 people\ndid \"Bored and Brilliant\" that week. Ninety percent cut down on their minutes. Seventy percent got more time to think. People told me that they slept better. They felt happier. My favorite note was from a guy\nwho said he felt like he was waking up from a mental hibernation. Some personal data and some neuroscience gave us permission\nto be offline a little bit more, and a little bit of boredom\ngave us some clarity and helped some of us set some goals. I mean, maybe constant connectivity won't be cool in a couple of years. But meanwhile, teaching people,\nespecially kids, how to use technology\nto improve their lives and to self-regulate needs to be part of digital literacy. So the next time you go\nto check your phone, remember that if you don't decide\nhow you're going to use the technology, the platforms will decide for you. And ask yourself: What am I really looking for? Because if it's to check email,\nthat's fine -- do it and be done. But if it's to distract yourself\nfrom doing the hard work that comes with deeper thinking, take a break, stare out the window and know that by doing nothing you are actually being\nyour most productive and creative self. It might feel weird\nand uncomfortable at first, but boredom truly can lead to brilliance. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Practice is the repetition of an action\nwith the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease,\nspeed, and confidence. So what does practice do in our brains\nto make us better at things? Our brains have two kinds \nof neural tissue: grey matter and white matter. The grey matter processes information\nin the brain, directing signals and sensory stimuli\nto nerve cells, while white matter is mostly made up\nof fatty tissue and nerve fibers. In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from\nthe brain's grey matter, down the spinal cord, through a chain of nerve fibers\ncalled axons to our muscles. So how does practice or repetition\naffect the inner workings of our brains? The axons that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance\ncalled myelin. And it's this myelin covering, or sheath,\nthat seems to change with practice. Myelin is similar to insulation\non electrical cables. It prevents energy loss from electrical\nsignals that the brain uses, moving them more efficiently\nalong neural pathways. Some recent studies in mice suggest\nthat the repetition of a physical motion increases the layers of myelin sheath\nthat insulates the axons. And the more layers, the greater\nthe insulation around the axon chains, forming a sort of superhighway\nfor information connecting your brain to your muscles. So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes \nto muscle memory, muscles themselves \ndon't really have memory. Rather, it may be the myelination\nof neural pathways that gives these athletes \nand performers their edge with faster and more efficient \nneural pathways. There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours,\ndays, and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill. While we don't yet have a magic number, we do know that mastery isn't simply about\nthe amount of hours of practice. It's also the quality and effectiveness\nof that practice. Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused, and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge \nof one's current abilities. So if effective practice is the key, how can we get the most \nout of our practice time? Try these tips. Focus on the task at hand. Minimize potential distractions by turning\noff the computer or TV and putting your cell phone \non airplane mode. In one study, researchers observed 260\nstudents studying. On average, those students were able to stay \non task for only six minutes at a time. Laptops, smartphones, \nand particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions. Start out slowly or in slow-motion. Coordination is built with repetitions,\nwhether correct or incorrect. If you gradually increase the speed\nof the quality repetitons, you have a better chance \nof doing them correctly. Next, frequent repetitions with allotted\nbreaks are common practice habits of elite performers. Studies have shown that many top athletes,\nmusicians, and dancers spend 50-60 hours per week on activities\nrelated to their craft. Many divide their time \nused for effective practice into multiple daily practice sessions\nof limited duration. And finally, practice in your brain\nin vivid detail. It's a bit surprising, but a number\nof studies suggest that once a physical motion \nhas been established, it can be reinforced \njust by imagining it. In one study, 144 basketball players\nwere divided into two groups. Group A physically practiced \none-handed free throws while Group B only \nmentally practiced them. When they were tested at the end\nof the two week experiment, the intermediate and experienced\nplayers in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount. As scientists get closer to unraveling\nthe secrets of our brains, our understanding of effective practice\nwill only improve. In the meantime, effective practice\nis the best way we have of pushing our individual limits, achieving new heights, and maximizing our potential."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What properties of practice lead to mastery?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Amount of time"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Quality of time"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Effectiveness of the sessions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In actuality, muscle memory is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "How things work in the body"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The neural pathway between the brain and muscles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Retained information contained in the muscle fibers themselves"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is myelin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Grey tissue matter that prevents energy loss from electrical signals traveling from the brain to other parts of the body"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An axon chain found in the grey matter of the brain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A fatty white substance that prevents energy loss from electrical signals traveling from the brain to other parts of the body"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A callous developed on the skin after numerous practice repetitions"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When Facebook, cell phones, and laptops were available to students while studying, how long on average were the students able to stay on task in the one research study?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "3 minutes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6 minutes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "8 minutes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "12 minutes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What are some typical practice habits of successful athletes and performers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spend 50-60 hours per week on activities related to their craft"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Practice frequent repetitions with allotted breaks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Divide practice time into multiple sessions of limited duration"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 81, "lesson": 11, "title": "What would happen if you didn’t drink water? - Mia Nacamulli", "category": "Nutrition", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-would-happen-if-you-didn-t-drink-water-mia-nacamulli", "transcript": {"en": "Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps, to the cells inside our own bodies. Depending on factors like location, fat index, age, and sex, the average human is between 55-60% water. At birth, human babies are even wetter. Being 75% water, \nthey are swimmingly similar to fish. But their water composition drops to 65%\nby their first birthday. So what role does water \nplay in our bodies, and how much do we actually need to drink\nto stay healthy? The H20 in our bodies works to cushion\nand lubricate joints, regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord. Water isn't only in our blood. An adult's brain and heart are almost\nthree quarters water. That's roughly equivalent to the amount\nof moisture in a banana. Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%. And even seemingly dry human bones\nare 31% water. If we are essentially made of water, and surrounded by water, why do we still need to drink so much? Well, each day we lose two to three liters\nthrough our sweat, urine, and bowel movements, and even just from breathing. While these functions \nare essential to our survival, we need to compensate for the fluid loss. Maintaining a balanced water level\nis essential to avoid dehydration or over-hydration, both of which can have devastating\neffects on overall health. At first detection of low water levels, sensory receptors \nin the brain's hypothalamus signal the release \nof antidiuretic hormone. When it reached the kidneys, \nit creates aquaporins, special channels that enable blood\nto absorb and retain more water, leading to concentrated, dark urine. Increased dehydration can cause\nnotable drops in energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as signs of cognitive impairment. A dehydrated brain works harder \nto accomplish the same amount as a normal brain, and it even temporarily shrinks\nbecause of its lack of water. Over-hydration, or hyponatremia, is usually caused by overconsumption\nof water in a short amount of time. Athletes are often the victims \nof over-hydration because of complications \nin regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions. Whereas the dehydrated brain amps\nup the production of antidiuretic hormone, the over-hydrated brain slows,\nor even stops, releasing it into the blood. Sodium electrolytes in the body\nbecome diluted, causing cells to swell. In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with \nthe resulting volumes of dilute urine. Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache, vomiting, and, in rare instances, seizures\nor death. But that's a pretty extreme situation. On a normal, day-to-day basis, maintaining a well-hydrated system\nis easy to manage for those of us fortunate enough \nto have access to clean drinking water. For a long time, conventional wisdom said\nthat we should drink eight glasses a day. That estimate has since been fine-tuned. Now, the consensus is that the amount\nof water we need to imbibe depends largely on our weight\nand environment. The recommended daily intake varies from\nbetween 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men, and about 2-2.7 liters for women, a range that is pushed up \nor down if we are healthy, active, old, or overheating. While water is the healthiest hydrator, other beverages, even those with caffeine \nlike coffee or tea, replenish fluids as well. And water within food makes up \nabout a fifth of our daily H20 intake. Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli are over 90% water, and can supplement liquid intake while\nproviding valuable nutrients and fiber. Drinking well might also have various\nlong-term benefits. Studies have shown that optimal hydration\ncan lower the chance of stroke, help manage diabetes, and potentially reduce the risk\nof certain types of cancer. No matter what, getting the right amount\nof liquid makes a world of difference in how you'll feel, think, and function day to day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "At birth, what percentage of a human baby is comprised of water?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "55%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "65%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "70%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "75%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When antidiuretic hormones reach the kidneys, what is created?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Aquaporins"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ADH"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sweat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sodium electrolytes"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "We lose 2 to 3 liters of water each day by doing which of the following?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Breathing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Urinating"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sweating"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Drinking too much water in a short amount of time is referred to as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dehydration"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Overhydration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dilution"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Supplementation"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 81, "lesson": 12, "title": "What happens when you have a concussion? - Clifford Robbins", "category": "Medical Conditions", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-happens-when-you-have-a-concussion-clifford-robbins", "transcript": {"en": "Each year in the United States, players of sports \nand recreational activities receive between 2.5 \nand 4 million concussions. How dangerous are all those concussions? The answer is complicated, and lies in how the brain responds\nwhen something strikes it. The brain is made of soft fatty tissue,\nwith a consistency something like jello. Inside its protective membranes\nand the skull's hard casing, this delicate organ \nis usually well-shielded. But a sudden jolt can make the brain shift and bump against \nthe skull's hard interior, and unlike jello, the brain's tissue\nisn't uniform. It's made of a vast network\nof 90 billion neurons, which relay signals through their long\naxons to communicate throughout the brain and control our bodies. This spindly structure makes \nthem very fragile so that when impacted, neurons\nwill stretch and even tear. That not only disrupts their ability\nto communicate but as destroyed axons begin\nto degenerate, they also release toxins\ncausing the death of other neurons, too. This combination of events causes\na concussion. The damage can manifest \nin many different ways including blackout, headache, blurry vision, balance problems, altered mood and behavior, problems with memory, \nthinking, and sleeping, and the onset of anxiety and depression. Every brain is different, which explains why people's experiences\nof concussions vary so widely. Luckily, the majority of concussions\nfully heal and symptoms disappear\nwithin a matter of days or weeks. Lots of rest and a gradual return\nto activity allows the brain to heal itself. On the subject of rest, many people have heard that\nyou're not supposed to sleep shortly after receiving a concussion\nbecause you might slip into a coma. That's a myth. So long as doctors aren't concerned there\nmay also be a more severe brain injury, like a brain bleed, there's no documented problem with\ngoing to sleep after a concussion. Sometimes, victims of concussion can\nexperience something called post-concussion syndrome, or PCS. People with PCS may experience\nconstant headaches, learning difficulties, and behavioral symptoms that even\naffect their personal relationships for months or years after the injury. Trying to play through a concussion,\neven for only a few minutes, or returning to sports too soon\nafter a concussion, makes it more likely to develop PCS. In some cases, a concussion \ncan be hard to diagnose because the symptoms unfold slowly\nover time. That's often true of \nsubconcussive impacts which result from lower impact jolts\nto the head than those that cause concussions. This category of injury doesn't cause\nnoticable symptoms right away, but can lead to severe degenerative\nbrain diseases over time if it happens repeatedly. Take soccer players, who are known\nfor repeatedly heading soccer balls. Using a technique called\nDiffusion Tensor Imaging, we're beginning to find out what effect\nthat has on the brain. This method allows scientists to find\nlarge axon bundles and see how milder blows\nmight alter them structurally. In 2013, researchers using \nthis technique discovered that athletes who had \nheaded the ball most, about 1,800 times a year, had damaged the structural integrity\nof their axon bundles. The damage was similar to how\na rope will fail when the individual fibers start to fray. Those players also performed worse\non short-term memory tests, so even though no one suffered\nfull-blown concussions, these subconcussive hits added up\nto measurable damage over time. In fact, researchers know that an\noverload of subconcussive hits is linked to a degenerative brain disease\nknown as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. People with CTE suffer from changes\nin their mood and behavior that begin appearing in their 30s or 40s followed by problems with thinking\nand memory that can, in some cases, even result\nin dementia. The culprit is a protein called tau. Usually, tau proteins support tiny tubes\ninside our axons called microtubules. It's thought that repeated subconcussive\nhits damage the microtubules, causing the tau proteins to dislodge\nand clump together. The clumps disrupt transport\nand communication along the neuron and drive the breakdown of connections\nwithin the brain. Once the tau proteins \nstart clumping together, they cause more clumps to form and continue to spread \nthroughout the brain, even after head impacts have stopped. The data show that at least\namong football players, between 50 and 80% of concussions\ngo unreported and untreated. Sometimes that's because it's hard to tell a concussion has occurred \nin the first place. But it's also often due to pressure\nor a desire to keep going despite the fact that something's wrong. This doesn't just undermine recovery. It's also dangerous. Our brains aren't invincible. They still need us to shield \nthem from harm and help them undo damage\nonce it's been done."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following could be a concussion symptom?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Headaches"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sensitivity to light"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Depression"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Attention problems"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What causes the symptoms of concussion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A head impact causes the brain to shake, which forms bruises on the brain’s surface"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A head impact causes the brain to shake, stretching and tearing fragile brain cells, disrupting signals"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A head impact causes the brain to swell, which squeezes brain cells together and interrupts normal functions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The impact from a concussion dislodges cells inside the brain, disrupting normal circuitry"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements about concussions is false?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Most concussion fully heal within a matter of days or weeks"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Most concussions are never unreported"}, {"label": "C", "text": "You shouldn’t go to sleep after a concussion, because you may slip into a coma"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above statements are true"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is a sub-concussive blow?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A low level head impact that causes concussion symptoms"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A low level head impact that doesn’t cause concussion symptoms, but over time can accumulate into brain damage"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A head impact caused by a large sandwich"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A head impact that causes the brain to hit the inside of the skull"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements about Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy is FALSE?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Repeated sub-concussive blows cause cumulative damage to fragile structures inside brain cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Proteins that normally live inside brain cells get loose, forming tangles that spread throughout the brain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "CTE can cause problems with thinking and memory, and can even lead to dementia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above statements are true"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None of the above statements are true"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 81, "lesson": 13, "title": "How to disagree productively and find common ground - Julia Dhar", "category": "Speaking", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/m18TCiU9", "transcript": {"en": "Some days, it feels like\nthe only thing we can agree on is that we can't agree on anything. Public discourse is broken. And we feel that everywhere -- panelists on TV\nare screaming at each other, we go online to find\ncommunity and connection, and we end up leaving\nfeeling angry and alienated. In everyday life, probably\nbecause everyone else is yelling, we are so scared to get into an argument that we're willing not to engage at all. Contempt has replaced conversation. My mission in life is to help us\ndisagree productively. To find ways to bring truth to light,\nto bring new ideas to life. I think -- I hope -- that there is a model\nfor structured disagreement that's kind of mutually respectful and assumes a genuine desire\nto persuade and be persuaded. And to uncover it,\nlet me take you back a little bit. So, when I was 10 years old,\nI loved arguing. This, like, tantalizing possibility that you could convince someone\nof your point of view, just with the power of your words. And perhaps unsurprisingly, my parents and teachers\nloved this somewhat less. (Laughter) And in much the same way as they decided that four-year-old Julia might benefit\nfrom gymnastics to burn off some energy, they decided that I might benefit\nfrom joining a debate team. That is, kind of, go somewhere\nto argue where they were not. (Laughter) For the uninitiated, the premises of formal debate\nare really straightforward: there's a big idea on the table -- that we support civil disobedience,\nthat we favor free trade -- and one group of people\nwho speaks in favor of that idea, and one against. My first debate in the cavernous auditorium\nof Canberra Girls Grammar School was kind of a bundle\nof all of the worst mistakes that you see on cable news. It felt easier to me to attack\nthe person making the argument rather than the substance\nof the ideas themselves. When that same person challenged my ideas, it felt terrible, I felt\nhumiliated and ashamed. And it felt to me like\nthe sophisticated response to that was to be as extreme as possible. And despite this very shaky entry\ninto the world of debate, I loved it. I saw the possibility, and over many years\nworked really hard at it, became really skilled\nat the technical craft of debate. I went on to win the World Schools\nDebating Championships three times. I know, you're just finding out\nthat this is a thing. (Laughter) But it wasn't until\nI started coaching debaters, persuaders who are really\nat the top of their game, that I actually got it. The way that you reach people\nis by finding common ground. It's by separating ideas from identity and being genuinely open to persuasion. Debate is a way to organize conversations\nabout how the world is, could, should be. Or to put it another way, I would love to offer you\nmy experience-backed, evidence-tested guide\nto talking to your cousin about politics at your next family dinner; reorganizing the way in which your team\ndebates new proposals; thinking about how we change\nour public conversation. And so, as an entry point into that: debate requires that we engage\nwith the conflicting idea, directly, respectfully, face to face. The foundation of debate is rebuttal. The idea that you make a claim\nand I provide a response, and you respond to my response. Without rebuttal, it's not debate,\nit's just pontificating. And I had originally imagined\nthat the most successful debaters, really excellent persuaders, must be great at going to extremes. They must have some magical ability\nto make the polarizing palatable. And it took me a really\nlong time to figure out that the opposite is actually true. People who disagree the most productively\nstart by finding common ground, no matter how narrow it is. They identify the thing\nthat we can all agree on and go from there: the right to an education,\nequality between all people, the importance of safer communities. What they're doing is inviting us into what psychologists\ncall shared reality. And shared reality\nis the antidote to alternative facts. The conflict, of course, is still there. That's why it's a debate. Shared reality just gives us\na platform to start to talk about it. But the trick of debate\nis that you end up doing it directly, face to face, across the table. And research backs up\nthat that really matters. Professor Juliana Schroeder\nat UC Berkeley and her colleagues have research that suggests\nthat listening to someone's voice as they make a controversial argument is literally humanizing. It makes it easier to engage\nwith what that person has to say. So, step away from the keyboards,\nstart conversing. And if we are to expand\nthat notion a little bit, nothing is stopping us from pressing pause\non a parade of keynote speeches, the sequence of very polite\npanel discussions, and replacing some of that\nwith a structured debate. All of our conferences could have,\nat their centerpiece, a debate over the biggest,\nmost controversial ideas in the field. Each of our weekly team meetings\ncould devote 10 minutes to a debate about a proposal to change\nthe way in which that team works. And as innovative ideas go,\nthis one is both easy and free. You could start tomorrow. (Laughter) And once we're inside this shared reality, debate also requires\nthat we separate ideas from the identity\nof the person discussing them. So in formal debate, nothing is a topic\nunless it is controversial: that we should raise\nthe voting age, outlaw gambling. But the debaters don't choose their sides. So that's why it makes no sense\nto do what 10-year-old Julia did. Attacking the identity of the person\nmaking the argument is irrelevant, because they didn't choose it. Your only winning strategy is to engage with the best, clearest,\nleast personal version of the idea. And it might sound impossible\nor naive to imagine that you could ever take that notion\noutside the high school auditorium. We spend so much time dismissing ideas\nas democrat or republican. Rejecting proposals\nbecause they came from headquarters, or from a region\nthat we think is not like ours. But it is possible. When I work with teams,\ntrying to come up with the next big idea, or solve a really complex problem, I start by asking them, all of them,\nto submit ideas anonymously. So by way of illustration, two years ago, I was working with multiple\ngovernment agencies to generate new solutions\nto reduce long-term unemployment. Which is one of those really wicked, sticky, well-studied\npublic policy problems. So exactly as I described,\nright at the beginning, potential solutions were captured\nfrom everywhere. We aggregated them, each of them was produced\non an identical template. At this point, they all look the same,\nthey have no separate identity. And then, of course,\nthey are discussed, picked over, refined, finalized. And at the end of that process,\nmore than 20 of those new ideas are presented to the cabinet ministers\nresponsible for consideration. But more than half of those,\nthe originator of those ideas was someone who might have a hard time\ngetting the ear of a policy advisor. Or who, because of their identity, might not be taken\nentirely seriously if they did. Folks who answer the phones,\nassistants who manage calendars, representatives from agencies\nwho weren't always trusted. Imagine if our news media\ndid the same thing. You can kind of see it now --\na weekly cable news segment with a big policy proposal on the table that doesn't call it\nliberal or conservative. Or a series of op-eds\nfor and against a big idea that don't tell you\nwhere the writers worked. Our public conversations,\neven our private disagreements, can be transformed by debating ideas,\nrather than discussing identity. And then, the thing that debate\nallows us to do as human beings is open ourselves,\nreally open ourselves up to the possibility that we might be wrong. The humility of uncertainty. One of the reasons it is so hard\nto disagree productively is because we become\nattached to our ideas. We start to believe that we own them\nand that by extension, they own us. But eventually, if you debate long enough, you will switch sides, you'll argue for and against\nthe expansion of the welfare state. For and against compulsory voting. And that exercise\nflips a kind of cognitive switch. The suspicions that you hold about people who espouse beliefs\nthat you don't have, starts to evaporate. Because you can imagine yourself\nstepping into those shoes. And as you're stepping into those, you're embracing\nthe humility of uncertainty. The possibility of being wrong. And it's that exact humility\nthat makes us better decision-makers. Neuroscientist and psychologist Mark Leary\nat Duke University and his colleagues have found that people\nwho are able to practice -- and it is a skill -- what those researchers call\nintellectual humility are more capable of evaluating\na broad range of evidence, are more objective when they do so, and become less defensive\nwhen confronted with conflicting evidence. All attributes that we want in our bosses, colleagues, discussion partners,\ndecision-makers, all virtues that we would like\nto claim for ourselves. And so, as we're embracing\nthat humility of uncertainty, we should be asking each other,\nall of us, a question. Our debate moderators, our news anchors\nshould be asking it of our elective representatives\nand candidates for office, too. \"What is it that you have changed\nyour mind about and why?\" \"What uncertainty are you humble about?\" And this by the way, isn't some fantasy about how public life\nand public conversations could work. It has precedent. So, in 1969, beloved American children's\ntelevision presenter Mister Rogers sits impaneled before the United States congressional\nsubcommittee on communications, chaired by the seemingly very\ncurmudgeonly John Pastore. And Mister Rogers is there\nto make a kind of classic debate case, a really bold proposal: an increase in federal funding\nfor public broadcasting. And at the outset, committee disciplinarian\nSenator Pastore is not having it. This is about to end\nreally poorly for Mister Rogers. But patiently, very reasonably,\nMister Rogers makes the case why good quality children's broadcasting, the kinds of television programs\nthat talk about the drama that arises in the most ordinary of families, matters to all of us. Even while it costs us. He invites us into a shared reality. And on the other side of that table, Senator Pastore listens,\nengages and opens his mind. Out loud, in public, on the record. And Senator Pastore\nsays to Mister Rogers, \"You know, I'm supposed to be\na pretty tough guy, and this is the first time\nI've had goosebumps in two days.\" And then, later, \"It looks like you\njust earned the 20 million dollars.\" We need many more Mister Rogers. People with the technical skills\nof debate and persuasion. But on the other side of that table, we need many, many,\nmany more Senator Pastores. And the magic of debate\nis that it lets you, it empowers you to be both Mister Rogers\nand Senator Pastore simultaneously. When I work with those same teams\nthat we talked about before, I ask them at the outset to pre-commit\nto the possibility of being wrong. To explain to me and to each other\nwhat it would take to change their minds. And that's all about the attitude,\nnot the exercise. Once you start thinking about\nwhat it would take to change your mind, you start to wonder why\nyou were quite so sure in the first place. There is so much\nthat the practice of debate has to offer us\nfor how to disagree productively. And we should bring it to our workplaces, our conferences,\nour city council meetings. And the principles of debate can transform\nthe way that we talk to one another, to empower us to stop talking\nand to start listening. To stop dismissing\nand to start persuading. To stop shutting down\nand to start opening our minds. Thank you so much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

That's over 365 kilograms \na year per person, and more than 28,800 kilograms\nover the course of a lifetime. And every last scrap makes its way\nthrough the digestive system. Comprised of ten organs \ncovering nine meters, and containing \nover 20 specialized cell types, this is one of the most diverse\nand complicated systems in the human body. Its parts continuously work in unison\nto fulfill a singular task: transforming the raw materials\nof your food into the nutrients and energy\nthat keep you alive. Spanning the entire length of your torso, the digestive system \nhas four main components. First, there's the gastrointestinal tract, a twisting channel \nthat transports your food and has an internal surface area\nof between 30 and 40 square meters, enough to cover half a badminton court. Second, there's the pancreas, gallbladder, and liver, a trio of organs that break down food\nusing an array of special juices. Third, the body's enzymes, hormones, nerves, and blood all work together to break down food, modulate the digestive process, and deliver its final products. Finally, there's the mesentery, a large stretch of tissue that supports and positions all your digestive organs \nin the abdomen, enabling them to do their jobs. The digestive process begins\nbefore food even hits your tongue. Anticipating a tasty morsel, glands in your mouth start \nto pump out saliva. We produce about 1.5 liters\nof this liquid each day. Once inside your mouth, chewing combines with the sloshing saliva to turn food into a moist lump \ncalled the bolus. Enzymes present in the saliva\nbreak down any starch. Then, your food finds itself at the rim of a 25-centimeter-long tube \ncalled the esophagus, down which it must plunge \nto reach the stomach. Nerves in the surrounding \nesophageal tissue sense the bolus's presence \nand trigger peristalsis, a series of defined muscular contractions. That propels the food into the stomach, where it's left at the mercy\nof the muscular stomach walls, which bound the bolus, \nbreaking it into chunks. Hormones, secreted by cells in the lining,\ntrigger the release of acids and enzyme-rich juices \nfrom the stomach wall that start to dissolve the food\nand break down its proteins. These hormones also alert the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder to produce digestive juices and transfer bile, a yellowish-green \nliquid that digests fat, in preparation for the next stage. After three hours inside the stomach, the once shapely bolus is now\na frothy liquid called chyme, and it's ready to move into\nthe small intestine. The liver sends bile \nto the gallbladder, which secretes it into the first portion of\nthe small intestine called the duodenum. Here, it dissolves the fats\nfloating in the slurry of chyme so they can be easily digested\nby the pancreatic and intestinal juices that have leached onto the scene. These enzyme-rich juices break the fat\nmolecules down into fatty acids and glycerol for easier \nabsorption into the body. The enzymes also carry out \nthe final deconstruction of proteins into amino acids and carbohydrates into glucose. This happens in the \nsmall intestine's lower regions, the jejunum and ileum, which are coated in millions \nof tiny projections called villi. These create a huge surface area\nto maximize molecule absorption and transference into the blood stream. The blood takes them on the final\nleg of their journey to feed the body's organs and tissues. But it's not over quite yet. Leftover fiber, water, and dead cells \nsloughed off during digestion make it into the large intestine,\nalso known as the colon. The body drains out most of the remaining\nfluid through the intestinal wall. What's left is a soft mass called stool. The colon squeezes this byproduct\ninto a pouch called the rectum, where nerves sense it expanding and tell the body when \nit's time to expel the waste. The byproducts of digestion\nexit through the anus and the food's long journey, typically lasting between 30 and 40 hours, is finally complete."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The digestive system contains ______ organs.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "12"}, {"label": "B", "text": "9"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Food is pushed into your stomach by ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Muscular contractions called peristalsis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Digestive juices"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Voluntary control"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gravity"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "After several hours inside the stomach, the food becomes ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A bolus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A liquid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chyme"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A solid lump"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The role of the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder is to ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Use enzymes and bile to break down food and extract its nutrients"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Break food into small chunks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Clear the system of any toxins"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Remove liquid from the stomach"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The digestive process begins before you put food in your mouth.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 81, "lesson": 15, "title": "How our siblings shape who we are - Jeff Kluger", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/jLvoMSWT", "transcript": {"en": "Transcriber: TED Translators Admin\nReviewer: Camille Martínez TED has already persuaded me\nto change my life in one small way, by persuading me to change\nthe opening of my speech. I love this idea of engagement. So, when you leave here today, I'm going to ask you\nto engage or re-engage with some of the most important\npeople in your lives: your brothers and sisters. It can be a profoundly\nlife-affirming thing to do, even if it isn't always easy. This is a man named Elliot, for whom things were very difficult. Elliot was a drunk. He spent most of his life\nbattling alcoholism, depression, morphine addiction, and that life ended\nwhen he was just 34 years old. What made things harder for Elliot\nis that his last name was Roosevelt. And he could never quite\nget past the comparisons with his big brother Teddy, for whom things always seemed\nto come a little bit easier. It wasn't easy being Bobby, either. He was also the sibling of a president. But he adored his brother, Jack. He fought for him, he worked for him. And when Jack died, he bled for him, too. In the years that followed,\nBobby would smile, but it seemed labored. He'd lose himself in his work, but it seemed tortured. Bobby's own death, so similar to John's, seems somehow fitting. John Kennedy was robbed of his young life; Bobby seemed almost\nto have been relieved of his. There may be no relationship\nthat effects us more profoundly, that's closer, finer, harder, sweeter, happier, sadder, more filled with joy or fraught with woe than the relationship we have\nwith our brothers and sisters. There's power in the sibling bond. There's pageantry. There's petulance, too, as when Neil Bush, sibling of both a president\nand a governor, famously griped, \"I've lost patience for being compared\nto my older brothers,\" as if Jeb and George W\nwere somehow responsible for the savings and loan scandal\nand the messy divorce that marked Neil in the public eye. But more important\nthan all of these things, the sibling bond can be\na thing of abiding love. Our parents leave us too early, our spouse and our children\ncome along too late. Our siblings are the only ones\nwho are with us for the entire ride. Over the arc of decades,\nthere may be nothing that defines us and forms us\nmore powerfully than our relationship\nwith our sisters and brothers. It was true for me, it's true for your children and if you have siblings,\nit's true for you, too. This picture was taken when Steve,\non the left, was eight years old. I was six, our brother Gary was five\nand my brother Bruce was four. I will not say what year it was taken. It was not this year. (Laughter) I open my new book, \"The Sibling Effect,\" on a Saturday morning, not long before this picture was taken, when the three older brothers decided\nthat it might be a very good idea to lock the younger brother\nin a fuse cabinet in our playroom. (Laughter) We were, believe it or not,\ntrying to keep him safe. Our father was a hotheaded man, somebody who didn't take kindly\nto being disturbed on Saturday mornings. I don't know what he thought his life\nwould be like on Saturday mornings when he had four sons, ages four years old or younger\nwhen the youngest one was born, but they weren't quiet. He did not take to that well. And he would react to being\ndisturbed on a Saturday morning by stalking into the playroom and administering a very freewheeling\nform of a corporal punishment, lashing out at whoever\nwas within arms' reach. We were by no means battered children\nbut we did get hit, and we found it terrifying. So we devised a sort of\nscatter-and-hide drill. (Laughter) As soon as we saw or heard\nthe footsteps coming, Steve, the oldest, would wriggle\nunder the couch, I would dive into the closet\nin the playroom, Gary would dive into\na window-seat toy chest, but not before we closed\nBruce inside the fuse box. We told him it was\nAlan Shepard's space capsule, and that somehow made it work better. (Laughter) I dare say my father was never\nfooled by this ruse. And it was only in later\nyears that I began to think perhaps it wasn't a good idea\nto squeeze a four-year-old up against a panel of old-style,\nun-screwable high-voltage fuses. (Laughter) But my brothers and I,\neven through those unhappy times, came through them, with something\nthat was clear and hard and fine: a primal appreciation\nfor the bond we shared. We were a unit -- a loud, messy brawling, loyal, loving, lasting unit. We felt much stronger that way\nthan we ever could as individuals. And we knew that as our lives went on, we could always be able\nto call on that strength. We're not alone. Until 15 years ago, scientists didn't really pay much\nattention to the sibling bond. And with good reason: you have just one mother,\nyou have just one father if you do marriage right,\nyou have one spouse for life. Siblings can claim\nnone of that uniqueness. They're interchangeable, fungible,\na kind of household commodity. Parents set up shop and begin stocking\ntheir shelves with inventory, the only limitation being sperm,\negg and economics. (Laughter) As long as you can keep breathing,\nyou may as well keep stocking. Now, nature is perfectly happy\nwith that arrangement, because our primal directive here is to get as many of our genes\nas possible into the next generation. Animals wrestle with\nthese same issues, too, but they have a more straightforward way\nof dealing with things. A crested penguin that has laid two eggs\nwill take a good look at them and boot the smaller one out of the nest, the better to focus her attentions\non the presumably heartier chick in the bigger shell. A black eagle will allow\nall of her chicks to hatch and then stand back while the bigger ones\nfight it out with the little ones, typically ripping them to ribbons and then settling back\nto grow up in peace. Piglets, cute as they are, are born with a strange\nlittle outward set of pointing teeth, that they use to jab at one another as they compete\nfor the choicest nursing spots. The problem for scientists was that this whole idea of siblings\nas second-class citizens never really seemed to hold up. After the researchers\nhad learned all they could from the relationships in the family,\nmothers and other relationships, they still came up with some\ntemperamental dark matter that was pulling at us, exerting a gravity all its own. And that could only be our siblings. Humans are no different from animals. After we are born, we do whatever we can to attract the attention of our parents, determining what our strongest\nselling points are and marketing them ferociously. Someone's the funny one,\nsomeone's the pretty one, someone's the athlete,\nsomeone's the smart one. Scientists call this \"deidentification.\" If my older brother\nis a high-school football player -- which, if you saw my older\nbrother, you'd know he was not -- I could become a high-school\nfootball player, too and get at most 50 percent of the applause\nin my family for doing that. Or, I could become student\ncouncil president or specialize in the arts and get 100 percent\nof the attention in that area. Sometimes parents contaminate\nthe deidentification process, communicating to their kids subtly or not, that only certain kinds of accomplishments\nwill be applauded in the home. Joe Kennedy was famous for this, making it clear to his nine children that they were expected to compete\nwith one another in athletics and were expected to win, lest they be made to eat\nin the kitchen with the help, rather than in the dining room\nwith the family. It's no wonder that scrawny second-born Jack Kennedy\nfought so hard to compete with his fitter firstborn brother, Joe, often at his peril, at one point, engaging\nin a bicycle race around the house that resulted in a collision\ncosting John 28 stitches. Joe walked away essentially unharmed. Parents exacerbate this problem further when they exhibit favoritism, which they do overwhelmingly,\nno matter how much they admit it. A study I cite in this TIME magazine\ncovering in the book \"The Sibling Effect,\" found 70 percent of fathers\nand 65 percent of mothers exhibit a preference\nfor at least one child. And keep in mind here --\nthe keyword is \"exhibit.\" The remaining parents may simply be doing\na better job of concealing things. (Laughter) I like to say that 95 percent\nof all parents have a favorite, five percent are lying about it. The exception is my wife and me. Honestly, we do not have a favorite. (Laughter) It's not parents' fault that they harbor\nfeelings of favoritism. And here, too, our natural\nwiring is at work. Firstborns are the first products\non the familial assembly line. Parents typically get two years\nof investing dollars, calories and so many other resources in them, so that by the time\nthe second born comes along, the firstborn is already ...\nit's what corporations call \"sunk costs,\" you don't want to disinvest in this one and launch the R&D on the new product. (Laughter) So what we begin to do is say,\n\"I'm going to lean to the Mac OS X and let the Mac OS XI come out\nin a couple of years.\" So we tend to lean in that direction. (Laughter) But there are other forces at work, too. One of the same studies I looked at\nboth here and in the book found that, improbably, the most common favorite\nfor a father is the last-born daughter. The most common favorite\nfor a mother is the firstborn son. Now, this isn't Oedipal; never mind\nwhat the Freudians would have told us a hundred years ago. And it's not just that fathers\nare habitually wrapped around the fingers of their little girls, though I can tell you that,\nas the father of two girls, that part definitely plays a role. Rather, there is a certain\nreproductive narcissism at work. Your opposite-gender kids can never resemble you exactly. But if somehow they can resemble\nyou temperamentally, you'll love them all the more. As the result, the father\nwho is a businessman will just melt at the idea of his MBA daughter\nwith a tough-as-nails worldview. The mother who is a sensitive type\nwill go gooey over her son the poet. (Laughter) Birth order, another topic\nI covered for TIME, and another topic I cover in the book, plays out in other ways as well. Long before scientists\nbegan looking at this, parents noticed that there are\ncertain temperamental templates associated with all birth rankings: the serious, striving firstborn; the caught-in-a-thicket's middle born; the wild child of a last born. And once again, when science\ndid crack this field, they found out mom and dad are right. Firstborns across history have tended\nto be bigger and healthier than later borns, in part, because of the head start\nthey got on food in an area in which it could be scarce. Firstborns are also\nvaccinated more reliably and tend to have more\nfollow-up visits to doctors when they get sick. And this pattern continues today. This IQ question is, sadly -- I can\nsay this as a second-born -- a very real thing. Firstborns have a three-point\nIQ advantage over second borns and second borns have a 1.5 IQ\nadvantage over later borns, partly because of the exclusive attention\nfirstborns get from mom and dad, and partly because they get a chance\nto mentor the younger kids. All of this explains why firstborns\nare likelier to be CEOs, they are likelier to be senators, they are likelier to be astronauts, and they are likelier to earn more\nthan other kids are. Last borns come into the world\nwith a whole different set of challenges. The smallest and weakest cubs in the den, they're at the greatest risk\nof getting eaten alive, so they have to develop\nwhat are called \"low-power skills\" -- the ability to charm and disarm, to intuit what's going on\nin someone else's head, the better to duck\nthe punch before it lands. (Laughter) They're also flat-out funnier, which is another thing\nthat comes in handy, because a person who's making you laugh\nis a very hard person to slug. (Laughter) It's perhaps no coincidence\nthat over the course of history, some of our greatest satirists -- Swift, Twain, Voltaire, Colbert -- (Laughter) are either the last borns or among the last in very large families. Most middle borns don't get\nquite as sweet a deal. I think of us as the flyover states. We are -- (Laughter) we're the ones who fight harder\nfor recognition in the home. We're the ones who are always\nraising our hands while someone else at the table\nis getting called on. We're the ones who tend\nto take a little longer to find their direction in life. And there can be self-esteem\nissues associated with that, notwithstanding the fact\nthat I've been asked to do TED, so I feel much better\nabout these things right now. (Laughter) But the upside for middle borns\nis that they also tend to develop denser and richer relationships\noutside the home. But that advantage comes also\nfrom something of a disadvantage, simply because their needs\nweren't met as well in the home. The feuds in the playroom\nthat play out over favoritism, birth order and so many other issues are as unrelenting as they seem. In one study I cite in the book, children in the two-to-four age group engage in one fight every 6.3 minutes, or 9.5 fights an hour. That's not fighting --\nthat's performance art. (Laughter) That's extraordinary. One reason for this is that there are\na lot more people in your home than you think there are, or at least a lot more relationships. Every person in your house has\na discrete one-on-one relationship with every other person, and those pairings or dyads add up fast. In a family with two parents and two kids,\nthere are six dyads: Mom has a relationship with child A and B, Dad has a relationship with child A and B. There's the marital relationship, and there is the relationship\nbetween the kids themselves. The formula for this\nlooks very chilly but it's real. K equals the number of people\nin your household, and X equals the number of dyads. In a five-person family,\nthere are ten discrete dyads. The eight-person Brady Bunch --\nnever mind the sweetness here -- there were 28 dyads in that family. The original Kennedy family with nine kids\nhad 55 different relationships. And Bobby Kennedy, who grew up\nto have 11 children of his own, had a household with a whopping 91 dyads. This overpopulation of relationships makes fights unavoidable. And far and away the biggest trigger\nfor all sibling fights is property. Studies have found that over 95 percent\nof the fights among small children concern somebody touching, playing with, looking at the other person's stuff. (Laughter) This in its own way is healthy\nif it's very noisy, and the reason is that small children\ncome into the world with absolutely no control. They are utterly helpless. The only way they have\nof projecting their very limited power is through the objects\nthey can call their own. When somebody crosses\nthat very erasable line, they're going to go nuts,\nand that's what happens. Another very common casus belli\namong children is the idea of fairness, as any parent who hears 14 times a day,\n\"But that's unfair!\" can tell you. In a way this is good, too, though. Kids are born with a very innate sense\nof right and wrong, of a fair deal versus an unfair one, and this teaches them powerful lessons. Do you want to know how powerfully encoded\nfairness is in the human genome? We process that phenomenon through the same lobe in our brain\nthat processes disgust, meaning we react to the idea\nof somebody being cheated the same way we react to putrefied meat. (Laughter) Any wonder that this fellow,\nBernie Madoff, is unpopular? All of these dramas played out day to day, moment to moment, serve as a real-time,\ntotal-immersion exercise for life. Siblings teach each other conflict\navoidance and conflict resolution, when to stand up for themselves, when to stand down; they learn love, loyalty, honesty, sharing,\ncaring, compromise, the disclosure of secrets\nand much more important, the keeping of confidences. I listen to my young daughters --\naren’t they adorable? -- I listen to my young daughters\ntalking late into the night, the same way my parents, no doubt,\nlistened to my brothers and me talking, and sometimes I intervene,\nbut usually I don't. They're part of a conversation\nI am not part of, nobody else in the world is part of, and it's a conversation\nthat can and should go on for the rest of their lives. From this will come a sense of constancy, a sense of having a permanent\ntraveling companion, somebody with whom they road-tested life before they ever had to get out\nand travel it on their own. Brothers and sisters aren't\nthe sine qua non of a happy life; plenty of adult sibling\nrelationships are fatally broken and need to be abandoned\nfor the sanity of everybody involved. And only-children, throughout history,\nhave shown themselves to be creatively, brilliantly capable of getting their socialization\nand comradeship skills through friends, through cousins,\nthrough classmates. But having siblings and not\nmaking the most of those bonds is, I believe, folly of the first order. If relationships are broken\nand are fixable, fix them. If they work, make them even better. Failing to do so is a little like having\na thousand acres of fertile farmland and never planting it. Yes, you can always get your food\nat the supermarket, but think what you're\nallowing to lie fallow. Life is short, it's finite,\nand it plays for keeps. Siblings may be among the richest harvests\nof the time we have here. Thank you.

{"page": 81, "lesson": 16, "title": "A brie(f) history of cheese - Paul S. Kindstedt", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/a-brie-f-history-of-cheese-paul-s-kindstedt", "transcript": {"en": "Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons – there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, the earliest Neolithic farmers \nliving in the Fertile Crescent began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization itself. The rise of agriculture led to \ndomesticated sheep and goats, which ancient farmers harvested for milk. But when left in warm conditions \nfor several hours, that fresh milk began to sour. Its lactic acids caused proteins to \ncoagulate, binding into soft clumps. Upon discovering this \nstrange transformation, the farmers drained the remaining liquid – later named whey – and found the yellowish globs could be \neaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal. These clumps, or curds, became \nthe building blocks of cheese, which would eventually be aged, pressed, \nripened, and whizzed into a diverse cornucopia \nof dairy delights. The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic\npeople an enormous survival advantage. Milk was rich with essential proteins, \nfats, and minerals. But it also contained high \nquantities of lactose – a sugar which is difficult to process for \nmany ancient and modern stomachs. Cheese, however, could provide all of \nmilk’s advantages with much less lactose. And since it could be preserved \nand stockpiled, these essential nutrients could be eaten throughout scarce famines \nand long winters. Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragments \nfound in Turkey still contain telltale residues of \nthe cheese and butter they held. By the end of the Bronze Age, cheese was a standard commodity \nin maritime trade throughout the eastern Mediterranean. In the densely populated city-states of \nMesopotamia, cheese became a staple \nof culinary and religious life. Some of the earliest known writing includes administrative records \nof cheese quotas, listing a variety of cheeses for different\nrituals and populations across Mesopotamia. Records from nearby civilizations \nin Turkey also reference rennet. This animal byproduct, produced in the\nstomachs of certain mammals, can accelerate and control coagulation. Eventually this sophisticated cheesemaking\ntool spread around the globe, giving way to a wide variety of new, \nharder cheeses. And though some conservative food \ncultures rejected the dairy delicacy, many more embraced cheese, and quickly\nadded their own local flavors. Nomadic Mongolians used yaks’ milk to\ncreate hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag. Egyptians enjoyed goats’ milk cottage \ncheese, straining the whey with reed mats. In South Asia, milk was coagulated with a\nvariety of food acids, such as lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt and then hung to dry into loafs of paneer. This soft mild cheese could be added to \ncurries and sauces, or simply fried as a \nquick vegetarian dish. The Greeks produced bricks of salty brined\nfeta cheese, alongside a harder variety similar to \ntoday’s pecorino romano. This grating cheese was produced in Sicily and used in dishes all across the \nMediterranean. Under Roman rule, “dry cheese” \nor “caseus aridus,” became an essential ration for the nearly 500,000 soldiers guarding\nthe vast borders of the Roman Empire. And when the Western Roman \nEmpire collapsed, cheesemaking continued to evolve in the manors that dotted the medieval\nEuropean countryside. In the hundreds of Benedictine monasteries\nscattered across Europe, medieval monks experimented endlessly \nwith different types of milk, cheesemaking practices, and aging processes that led to many \nof today’s popular cheeses. Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster \nand several Swiss types were all refined and perfected \nby these cheesemaking clergymen. In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking was\nparticularly successful – producing a myriad of cow’s milk cheeses. By the end of the 14th century, Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of\nSwitzerland had become so profitable that a neighboring state invaded the \nGruyere highlands to take control of the growing \ncheese trade. Cheese remained popular through \nthe Renaissance, and the Industrial Revolution took \nproduction out of the monastery and into machinery. Today, the world produces roughly \n22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, shipped and consumed around the globe. But 10,000 years after its invention, local farms are still following in the \nfootsteps of their Neolithic ancestors, hand crafting one of humanity’s \noldest and favorite foods."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately how much cheese is produced annually in the world today?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 million kg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100 million kg"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 billion kg"}, {"label": "D", "text": "22 billion kg"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Cheese-making began in the Fertile Crescent as early as _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "500 CE"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1,000 BCE"}, {"label": "C", "text": "8,000 BCE"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100,000 BCE"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "An essential food, cheese in ancient times was also used _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "As an item of trade"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In religious rites"}, {"label": "C", "text": "As a military ration for soldiers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The discovery of rennet _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Created a new use for animal stomachs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Enabled milk to be coagulated in new ways"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Paved the way for the development of new hard cheese varieties"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In medieval Europe, many diverse cheeses were perfected in _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Benedictine monasteries"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Buddhist monasteries"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Muslim mosques"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Druid communities"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Approximately how much cheese is produced annually in the world today?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 million kg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100 million kg"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 billion kg"}, {"label": "D", "text": "22 billion kg"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

In minutes they stirred the camp \ninto a panic, stole about 70 horses,\nand disappeared. Led by a young chief \nnamed Quanah Parker, the raid was the latest \nin a long series of altercations along the Texas frontier \nbetween the indigenous people known as the Numunu, \nor Comanches, and the United States forces sent \nto steal Comanche lands for white settlers. Though the conflict was decades old, U.S. Colonel Ranald MacKenzie \nled the latest iteration. From summer to winter, he tracked Quanah. But Quanah was also tracking him, and each time the colonel \ndrew near his targets, they disappeared without \na trace into the vast plains. The Comanches had controlled \nthis territory for nearly 200 years, hunting buffalo and moving whole villages\naround the plains. They suppressed Spanish and Mexican \nattacks from the south, attempts to settle the land \nby the United States from the east, and numerous other indigenous peoples’ \nbids for power. The Comanche Empire was not \none unified group under central control, but rather a number of bands, \neach with its own leaders. What all of these bands had in common \nwas their prowess as riders— every man, woman, and child \nwas adept on horseback. Their combat skills on horseback far surpassed those of both \nother indigenous peoples and colonists, allowing them to control an enormous area\nwith relatively few people— probably about 40,000 at their peak and only about 4-5,000 by the time Quanah Parker and Ranald Mackenzie \nfaced off. Born around 1848, Quanah \nwas the eldest child of Peta Nocona, a leader of the Nokoni band, \nand Cynthia Ann Parker, a kidnapped white settler who assimilated\nwith the Comanches and took the name Naduah. When Quanah was a preteen, U.S. forces ambushed his village, \ncapturing his mother and sister. Quanah and his younger brother sought \nrefuge with a different Comanche band, the Quahada. In the years that followed, Quanah \nproved himself as a warrior and leader. In his early twenties, he and a young \nwoman named Weakeah eloped, enraging her powerful father \nand several other leaders. They stayed on the run for a year, attracting followers and establishing \nQuanah as a paraibo, or chief, at an exceptionally young age. Under his leadership the Quahada band \nwas able to elude the U.S. military and continue their way of life. But in the early 1870s, the East Coast \nmarket for buffalo hides became lucrative, and hunters slaughtered millions \nof buffalo in just a few years. Meanwhile, U.S. forces led \na surprise attack, killing nearly all the Quahada band’s \n1,400 horses and stealing the rest. Though he had vowed to never surrender, \nQuanah knew that without bison or horses, the Comanches faced \ncertain starvation in winter. So in 1875 Quanah \nand the Quahada band moved to the Fort Sill reservation \nin Oklahoma. As hunter-gatherers,\nthey could not transition easily to an agricultural way of life \non the reservation. The U.S. government had promised\nrations and supplies, but what they provided \nwas wildly insufficient. Quanah, meanwhile, was suddenly \nin a weak political position: he had no wealth or power \ncompared to others who had been \non the reservation longer. Still, he saw an opportunity. The reservation included ample grasslands— useless to the Comanches but perfect \nfor cattle ranchers to graze their herds. He began a profitable arrangement \nleasing the land to cattle ranchers, quietly at first. Eventually, he negotiated leasing rights\nwith the U.S. government, which ensured a steady source of income\nfor the Comanches on the reservation. As Quanah’s status on the reservation and recognition from government officials\ngrew, he secured better rations, advocated for the construction \nof schools and houses, and became one of three tribal judges \non the reservation court. Tired of speaking with multiple leaders, the U.S. government wanted to appoint \none chief of all Comanches— a role that hadn’t existed \noutside the reservation. Still, many Comanches supported \nQuanah for this role, just as several older leaders \nhad supported him to lead them against \nthe U.S. armed forces. Even Quanah’s former adversary, \nRanald MacKenzie, advocated for his appointment. Quanah acted in Hollywood movies \nand befriended American politicians, riding in Theodore Roosevelt’s\ninauguration parade. Still, he never cut his long braids and advocated for the Native American \nChurch and the use of peyote. He began to go by Quanah Parker, \nadopting his mother’s surname, and tried to track down \nhis mother and sister, eventually learning they had both \ndied shortly after their capture. Quanah adapted again and again—\nto different worlds, different roles, and circumstances that would seem \ninsurmountable to most. Though he wasn’t without critics, \nafter Quanah’s passing, Comanches began using the term “chairman” to designate the top elected official \nin the tribe, recognizing him \nas the last chief of the Comanches and a model of cultural \nsurvival and adaptation. In that spirit, today’s Comanche Nation\nlooks towards the future, with over 16,000 enrolled citizens \nand countless descendants."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the insider name of the Comanches?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ndé"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Numunu"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Kiowa"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Komantcia"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Cynthia Ann Parker is Quanah’s", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Grandmother"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mother"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mother-in-law"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sister"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What year did Quanah and his band move to the reservation in Oklahoma?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1850"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1865"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1875"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1880"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What band of Comanches did Quanah lead?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nokoni/They Travel Around"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Penatuka/Honey Eaters"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Quahada/Antelope Eaters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Yamparika/Root Eaters"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Today, the Comanche Nation includes approximately ________ enrolled citizens.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "17,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "40,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "170,000"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

At some point in your life,\nyou've probably eaten a potato. Delicious, for sure, but the fact is potatoes have played a\nmuch more significant role in our history than just that of the dietary staple\nwe have come to know and love today. Without the potato, our modern civilization \nmight not exist at all. 8,000 years ago in South America,\nhigh atop the Andes, ancient Peruvians were the first\nto cultivate the potato. Containing high levels of proteins\nand carbohydrates, as well as essential fats, vitamins\nand minerals, potatoes were the perfect food source\nto fuel a large Incan working class as they built and farmed \ntheir terraced fields, mined the Rocky Mountains, and created the sophisticated civilization\nof the great Incan Empire. But considering how vital they were\nto the Incan people, when Spanish sailors \nreturning from the Andes first brought potatoes to Europe, the spuds were duds. Europeans simply didn't want to eat what they considered dull and tasteless\noddities from a strange new land, too closely related to the deadly\nnightshade plant belladonna for comfort. So instead of consuming them, they used potatoes \nas decorative garden plants. More than 200 years would pass\nbefore the potato caught on as a major food source throughout Europe, though even then, it was predominantly eaten \nby the lower classes. However, beginning around 1750, and thanks at least in part to the wide availability\nof inexpensive and nutritious potatoes, European peasants \nwith greater food security no longer found themselves at the mercy of the regularly \noccurring grain famines of the time, and so their populations steadily grew. As a result, the British, Dutch\nand German Empires rose on the backs of the growing groups\nof farmers, laborers, and soldiers, thus lifting the West to its place\nof world dominion. However, not all European countries\nsprouted empires. After the Irish adopted the potato, their population dramatically increased, as did their dependence on the tuber\nas a major food staple. But then disaster struck. From 1845 to 1852, potato blight disease ravaged \nthe majority of Ireland's potato crop, leading to the Irish Potato Famine, one of the deadliest famines\nin world history. Over a million Irish citizens \nstarved to death, and 2 million more \nleft their homes behind. But of course, this wasn't the end\nfor the potato. The crop eventually recovered, and Europe's population,\nespecially the working classes, continued to increase. Aided by the influx of Irish migrants, Europe now had a large, sustainable,\nand well-fed population who were capable of manning\nthe emerging factories that would bring about our modern world\nvia the Industrial Revolution. So it's almost impossible to imagine\na world without the potato. Would the Industrial Revolution \never have happened? Would World War II have been lost\nby the Allies without this easy-to-grow crop\nthat fed the Allied troops? Would it even have started? When you think about it like this, many major milestones in world history\ncan all be at least partially attributed to the simple spud \nfrom the Peruvian hilltops."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The ______ civilization was aided by the potato's nutritional value.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Aztec"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Incan"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mayan"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tupi"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The potato was too closely related to which deadly species of plant for some European's comfort?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Deadly nightshade"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Water Hemlock"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tobacco"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rosary pea"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The Irish potato famine occurred between _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1745 - 1752"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1939 - 1945"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1599 - 1620"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1845 - 1852"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which country brought the potato to Europe?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Germany"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Portugal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ireland"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many Irish starved to death during the Irish potato famine?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "500,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5,000,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1,000,000"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 81, "lesson": 19, "title": "The best way to apologize (according to science)", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-best-way-to-apologize-according-to-science", "transcript": {"en": "Over the years, people have come \nup with some truly awful apologies. From classic non-apologies \nto evasive excuses, and flimsy corporate promises, it’s all too easy to give a bad apology. But researchers have found that good\napologies generally share certain elements and thoughtfully considering\nthese factors can help you make amends in a wide variety of situations. Since public apologies have their\nown unique complications, we’re going to focus on some\nperson-to-person examples. So, picture this: your new office has\nfree ice cream sandwiches in the communal fridge— or at least that’s what you thought. But on Friday, when you’re helping\nyour co-worker Terence set up another colleague's birthday party, he finds that half the ice cream he bought\nfor the celebration is gone. While this is obviously \nan embarrassing accident, coming forward and apologizing \nis still the right thing to do. Understanding and accepting\nresponsibility for your actions is what some researchers call\nthe “centerpiece of an apology.” But it’s okay if this feels difficult\nand vulnerable— it’s supposed to be! The costly nature of apologies is part\nof what makes them meaningful. So while you might be tempted to defend\nyour actions as accidental, it’s important to remember \nthat a good apology isn’t about making you feel better. It’s about seeking to understand \nthe perspective of the wronged party and repair the damage \nto your relationship. This means that while clarifying your \nintentions non-defensively can be helpful, your mistake being an accident shouldn’t\nabsolve you from offering a sincere apology. But what if your mistake \nwasn’t an accident? Consider this: you promised your friend Marie that you’ll\nattend her championship football match. But another friend just called\nto offer you an extra ticket for your favorite musician's\nfarewell tour. You know this is \na once-in-a-lifetime chance, and you can’t pass it up. Plus, you figure Marie wouldn’t\nmind if you miss the game— she always has plenty of fans\nsupporting her. But the next day, Marie tells you \nshe was really hurt when she didn’t see you in the crowd. You feel terrible for upsetting her \nand genuinely want to apologize. But while you regret hurting Marie, you’re not actually sure \nif you made the wrong choice. So how can you reach beyond\nthat terrible non-apology, “I’m sorry YOU feel this way”? In situations like this, it can be easy \nto focus on rationalizing your actions when you should be working to understand \nthe other person’s perspective. Consider asking Marie \nhow you made them feel to better understand your offense. In this case, Marie might explain \nthat she was disappointed you broke your promise, and she was really counting \non your support. This kind of clarity can help \nyou recognize your wrongdoing and honestly accept how your actions\ncaused harm. Then you can frame your apology \naround addressing her concerns, perhaps by admitting that it was wrong\nof you to break your promise, and you're sorry you weren't\nthere for her. Clearly acknowledging wrongdoing\nindicates that you know exactly how you messed up, and it can give Marie faith that you’ll \nbehave differently moving forward. But it’s always helpful to indicate \nexactly how you’ll change and what you’ll do to repair \nthe damage caused by your offense. Researchers call this \nthe “offer of repair,” and it's often rated as one of the most\ncritical parts of an apology. In some cases, these gestures\nare straightforward, like offering to replace\nthe ice cream you eat. However, with less \ntangible transgressions, this might need to be more symbolic, like expressing your love and respect\nfor someone you wronged. One common offer of repair \nis a verbal commitment not to make the same mistake again, but promising to do better only works\nif you actually do better. Taking the victim’s perspective, \naccepting responsibility, and making concrete offers of repair are just a few of the elements\nof a good apology. But remember, apologies aren’t about\ngetting forgiveness and moving on; they’re about expressing remorse\nand accepting accountability. And the best apologies are\njust the first step on the road to reconciliation."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What do some researchers consider the \"centerpiece of an apology\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Acknowledging the other person's feelings"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Finding mutual blame"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Accepting responsibility for your actions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reminding the wronged party that your actions were out of character"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A good apology is about ___", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Absolving yourself of guilt."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Receiving forgiveness."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eliminating bad feelings."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Understanding the perspective of the wronged party."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following can be part of a good apology?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A clarification of your intentions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A strongly argued defense of your actions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A reminder of all the times the other person has wronged you"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A lie that appeases the other person"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Under which circumstance is issuing an apology unnecessary?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The offending action was an accident."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The offending action was a conscious choice that you'd make again."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The offending action was something trivial."}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In an apology, what is the \"offer of repair\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The apologizer's plans to change their actions in the future"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A peace-offering gift presented to the wronged party"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The apologizer's request to move past a disagreement"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An optional tag at the end of an apology "}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 81, "lesson": 20, "title": "Does working hard really make you a good person? - Azim Shariff", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/does-working-hard-really-make-you-a-good-person-azim-shariff", "transcript": {"en": "Imagine for a second\nthat your job was made redundant by an advanced piece of software that could do the work\nat the same level of quality for free. But you happen to have three years left\non a guaranteed contract, and so your employer\ngives you two options. Either you can keep getting paid\nas per your contract, but stay home as the software does your job, or you can keep going in\nand doing the work that could have been automated for the same money. What would you do? Now most of you, I'm sure\nthis is a no-brainer. Take the money, go home,\nwatch TED talks. (Laughter) But there's always some\nwho would choose to keep working. What do you think of those people? What does it say about their character? This is the scenario about a hypothetical\nmedical scribe named Jeff that we gave to our research participants. For half the people in the study, the story ends with Jeff\nchoosing to go home, and for the other half it ends\nwith him choosing to keep working. And then we asked everybody\nwhat they thought of Jeff. Those who heard about the Jeff\nwho kept working saw him as less competent -- he does seem like a bit of a chump -- (Laughter) but they also saw him\nas warmer and more moral, somebody who could be trusted\nto do the right thing. They saw him as a good person. Even though Jeff added no extra value, people saw him as virtuous\nfor choosing to keep plugging away. Why is it that we see\nmere effort as moral? I am a psychology professor\nat the University of British Columbia, where I study morality. I've worked on religion and morality, I've worked on driverless\ncars and morality, but recently my collaborators and I\nhave been working on work itself. And in study after study, we find\nthat people attach moral worth to effort regardless of what that effort produces. So in another study, we asked people\nabout two widget makers. They produce the same number of widgets\nin the same amount of time at the same level of quality. But for one of them, it takes\na lot more effort to do so. People see that harder-working\nwidget maker as, again, less competent but again, more moral. And if you had to choose just one\nof those two as a cooperation partner, you would choose the one who struggles. We call this effort moralization. And it doesn't appear to just\nbe a North American thing. Work norms, of course,\ndiffer around the world, but we replicated our original\nAmerican result in South Korea, which is known by the numbers to be one of the hardest-working\ncountries in the OECD, and in France, which is known\nfor other strengths. (Laughter) In all of these places, the harder-working person\nwas seen as more moral and a better cooperation partner, even though they added no extra value. And it looks like this is something\nbroader than, say, the Protestant work ethic. Even the Hadza people, hunter-gatherers in Tanzania,\nshow something like it. When asked what qualities\ncontribute to good character, they didn't agree on very much,\nbut they did agree on two things. Generosity and hard work. So this intuitive connection\nbetween effort and morality doesn't appear to be the quirk\nof any one culture, but potentially something\nvery deep indeed. Now effort moralization makes sense\nat the individual level. Somebody who is willing to show\nthat they will put effort into even meaningless tasks, maybe even especially\ninto meaningless tasks, is somebody who's more likely\nto help you out. So I have a friend from work, Paul. Paul is an uncommonly charismatic man. Paul wears stylish pairs\nof raw denim jeans and Paul buys expensive bars of soap, 60-dollar bars of soap. And Paul is one of those types\nwho wakes up every morning and goes running. And when I first heard this, I sort of rolled my eyes at this being\none of those Mr. Perfect things. Actually, Dr. Perfect in this case. (Laughter) But then one day I saw Paul\non one of his morning runs, and instead of seeing a sleek,\ntype-A personality confidently striding through life, I saw Paul struggling,\nin an inelegant hobble (Laughter) with a grotesque grimace of something\nbetween annoyance and agony on his face. Running was hard for him. Every morning was effort, and the person who was willing\nto wake up for that, day after day, is the kind of person\nyou want in your corner. And Paul is in mine. He's not just the inspiration behind\nsome of the studies in this research, he is a collaborator on them as well. And he's a good man. The truth is, we're all in the market for finding the best\ncollaborators in life. And we're trying to show others\nthat we are that person as well. The evolutionary psychologists\ncall this partner choice. Just as we are trying to be and select\nthe best romantic partners, we are also trying to be and select\nthe best cooperation partners. We're all trying to surround ourselves with people who will\nhelp us out in a pinch, who won't slack off,\nwho will share things fairly. And as a result, any quality which makes you\na better cooperation partner, say, generosity\nor self-control or hard work, is seen as a moral quality. And so we have this simple heuristic: people who work hard are good. It's why you're more likely\nto donate to your friend who pledges to run a marathon\nfor cancer research, than your other friend who pledges\nto watch a \"Sex in the City\" marathon for the same cause. (Laughter) But what makes sense\nat the individual level can still become very problematic\nwhen scaled up to the societal level. Our intuition that effort is good\nfor its own sake, regardless of what it produces, has created a work environment\nwith perverse incentives. So when we start\nattaching worth to activity rather than to productivity, we start caring more\nabout whether somebody is a hard worker than whatever it is that that work\nwas supposed to achieve. And this can come\nat a very steep human cost. So you'll remember our example of Jeff, the medical scribe who chose\nto throw his time into the volcano as a sacrifice to the gods of hard work. That was just a contrived scenario. But how many Jeffs are out there, taking time that could have been spent\non love or on leisure and spending it on signaling effort? And how often are we Jeff, wearing workaholism as a badge of honor, a way to reassure people\nthat we are a good person, even if the person you're just trying\nto reassure is yourself? The anthropologist David Graeber wondered how capitalism could sustain so many\nof what he bluntly called bullshit jobs. These are jobs in which even the people\ndoing the work see it as pointless, accomplishing nothing of societal worth. A capitalistic system should root out\nthose inefficiencies, but it doesn't. And the reason it doesn't\nis because alongside capitalism, we also operate under another system. What the journalist\nDerek Thompson calls workism. Workism is about your job not just\nbeing the source of your paycheck, but the source of your identity and your pathway to self-actualization. Now that works for some people, but what makes workism a culture\nis that we all get forced to participate. Partner choice is not just about being\na good cooperation partner, but a better cooperation partner\nthan the next guy. Not just hard working, but harder working. And this can create\nthese arms races of workism. So you can imagine two office workers, both keen to show\nhow industrious they are, both keen to be the first car\nin the parking lot in the morning. And so they start one-upping each other\nby arriving earlier and earlier and earlier in the morning. And everybody else just seems\nlike more of a slacker every day. The culture punishes us\nfor not keeping up. And so we end up putting more and more in regardless of what comes out\nthe other side. And the culture maintains\nthe most laborious aspects of our jobs because it most appreciates us\nwhen it sees us putting in that labor. And as a consequence,\nevery other aspect of our job and our lives, however great, is made just a little less important. Now, this is not an argument\nagainst hard work. It's not. Hard work can be extremely\nmeaningful when it serves a purpose. Hard work built civilization. But how much of the effort we spend\nnow is done to build nothing but our own moral reputations. To just convince other people\nthat we are hard workers. And how much of what we admire\nin others is just effort porn? In one of his more candid moments, one of my graduate students\nsaid that he noticed I would send emails out\nat all hours of the day, 1 am, 2 am, 3 am. Now, this was because being a professor\nallowed me to maintain an adolescent sleep schedule\ndeep into my 30s. (Laughter) But what he then did was he got some app which scheduled his replies to come to me\nat one or two in the morning so as to make it seem like\nhe was also working all hours of the day. I'd clearly sent the wrong message, so much so that my student\nwas willing to delay the work to make it seem\nlike he was more industrious. It was literally bullshit work. I had to change my lab's culture. I had to convince my students that we weren't just\nabout the show of work, but what we were actually producing. And it's not such a simple thing to do. The mental circuit that connects effort\nto morality can be a stubborn one. When I teach about psychological\nbiases to my intro-psych students, I tell them that you can't always\nlearn to resist a bias, they can be very deeply ingrained, but you can learn to notice them so that you can account for them\nwhen making important decisions. We may not be able to break\nthat mental circuit, but we can learn to recognize our biases\nso they don't run our lives. There is a story,\nalmost certainly apocryphal, about perverse incentives\nin the era of British rule in India. Desperate to deal with the cobras\nthat were overrunning colonial Delhi, a bounty was put up for every cobra skin that was brought in. But the plan backfired because enterprising Indians started\nbreeding more cobras to kill them, bring in the skins and collect the bounty. And when the government\nfinally abandoned the plan, as the story goes, the breeders then released\nthe cobras into the city and the snake problem was worse than ever. Oops. (Laughter) The plan went awry because of the distance\nbetween what they wanted, which was fewer cobras, and what they asked for, which was an imperfect signal\nof fewer cobras, dead cobras. But I fear we've done\nsomething very real and very similar with work. We have built a culture\nthat asks for the wrong thing. If all we ask from each other\nis the effort that we put in, we will create a world full of effort\nand of hard labor and of cobras. But if what we ask from each other\nis to produce something meaningful, we will create a world full of meaning. And what could be more moral than that? Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

He's in the right front\npassenger seat of this SUV when it crashes on\nthe Garden State Parkway. He's transported\nto a New Jersey trauma center with multiple broken bones\nand multiple lacerations. He needs immediate surgery,\nseven units of blood, a mechanical ventilator\nto help him breathe and several more operations along the way. It's amazing he survived. But perhaps even more amazing, he was not wearing a seat belt. And, in fact, he never wore a seat belt, and the New Jersey state troopers\nwho used to drive Governor Corzine around used to beg him to wear a seat belt, but he didn't do it. Now, before Corzine\nwas Governor of New Jersey, he was the US Senator from New Jersey, and before that, he was\nthe CEO of Goldman Sachs, responsible for taking\nGoldman Sachs public, making hundreds of millions of dollars. Now, no matter what you think\nof Jon Corzine politically or how he made his money, nobody would say that he was stupid. But there he was, an unrestrained passenger\nin a car accident, at a time when every American knows\nthat seat belts save lives. This single story reflects\na fundamental weakness in our approach\nto improving health behavior. Nearly everything we tell doctors\nand everything we tell patients is based on the idea\nthat we behave rationally. If you give me information, I will process\nthat information in my head, and my behavior will change as a result. Do you think Jon Corzine didn't know\nthat seat belts save lives? Do you think he, like,\njust didn't get the memo? (Laughter) Jon Corzine did not have\na knowledge deficit, he had a behavior deficit. It's not that he didn't know better. He knew better. It's that he didn't do better. Instead, I think the mind\nis a high-resistance pathway. Changing someone's mind\nwith information is hard enough. Changing their behavior with information is harder still. The only way we're going to make\nsubstantial improvements in health and health care is to make substantial improvements\nin the behavior of health and health care. If you hit my patellar tendon\nwith a reflex hammer, my leg is going to jerk forward, and it's going to jerk forward\na lot faster and a lot more predictably than if I had to think about it myself. It's a reflex. We need to look for the equivalent\nbehavioral reflexes and hitch our health care wagon to those. Turns out, though, that most conventional approaches\nto human motivation are based on the idea of education. We assume that if people\ndon't behave as they should, it's because they didn't know any better. \"If only people knew that smoking\nwas dangerous, they wouldn't smoke.\" Or, we think about economics. The assumption there is that\nwe're all constantly calculating the costs and benefits\nof every one of our actions and optimizing that to make\nthe perfectly right, rational decision. If that were true, then all we need to do is to find the perfect\npayment system for doctors or the perfect co-payments\nand deductibles for patients, and everything would work out. A better approach lies\nin behavioral economics. Behavioral economists recognize\nthat we are irrational. Our decisions are based on emotion, or they're sensitive to framing\nor to social context. We don't always do what's in our own\nlong-term best interests. But the key contribution\nto behavioral economics is not in recognizing\nthat we are irrational; it's recognizing that we are irrational\nin highly predictable ways. In fact, it's the predictability\nof our psychological foibles that allows us to design\nstrategies to overcome them. Forewarned is forearmed. In fact, behavioral economists often use precisely the same behavioral\nreflexes that get us into trouble and turn them around to help us, rather than to hurt us. We see irrationality play out\nin something called \"present bias,\" where the outcomes in front of us\nare much more motivating than even more important outcomes\nfar in the future. If I'm on a diet --\nand I'm always on a diet -- (Laughter) and someone offers me a luscious-looking\npiece of chocolate cake, I know I should not\neat that chocolate cake. That chocolate cake will land\non that part of my body -- permanently -- where that kind of food naturally settles. But the chocolate cake\nlooks so good and delicious, and it's right in front of me, and the diet can wait 'til tomorrow. I used to love the comedian Steven Wright. He would have these Zen-like quips. My favorite one was this: \"Hard work pays off in the future, but laziness pays off right now.\" (Laughter) And patients also have present bias. If you have high blood pressure, even if you would desperately\nlike to avoid a stroke, and you know that taking\nyour antihypertensive medications is one of the best ways\nto reduce that risk, the stroke you avoid is far in the future\nand taking medications is right now. Almost half of the patients who are\nprescribed high blood pressure pills stop taking them within a year. Think of how many lives we could save if we could solve just that one problem. We also tend to overestimate\nthe value of small probabilities. This actually explains\nwhy state lotteries are so popular, even though they return\npennies on the dollar. Now, some of you\nmay buy lottery tickets -- it's fun, there's the chance\nyou might strike it rich ... But let's face it: this would be a horrible way\nto invest your retirement savings. I once saw a bumper sticker --\nI am not making this up -- that said, \"State lotteries are a special tax\non people who can't do math.\" (Laughter) It's not that we can't do the math, it's that we can't feel the math. And we also pay much too much\nattention to regret. We all hate the feeling of missing out. So, actually, there was\nthis recent lottery, a mega-jackpot lottery, that had a huge payoff,\nsomething like over a billion dollars. And everyone in my office\nis pooling money to buy lottery tickets, and I'm not having any of this. There I am, like, swaggering\naround the office, \"Lotteries are a special tax\non people who can't do math.\" (Laughter) And then it hits me: uh oh. What if they win? (Laughter) I'm the only one who shows up\nat work the next day. (Laughter) Now, it's not that I didn't want\nmy colleagues to win. I just didn't want them to win without me. Now, it would have been easier\nif I had just taken my 20-dollar bill and put it into the office shredder, and the results would have been the same. Even though I knew\nI shouldn't participate, I handed over my $20 bill, and I never saw it again. (Laughter) We've done a bunch\nof experiments with patients in which we give them\nthese electronic pill bottles so we can tell whether\nthey're taking their medication or not. And we reward them with a lottery. They get prizes. But they only get prizes if they had taken\ntheir medication the day before. If not, they get a message\nthat says something like, \"You would have won a hundred dollars, but you didn't take your medicine\nyesterday, so you don't get it.\" Well, it turns out, patients hate that. They hate the sense of missing out, and because they can anticipate\nthat feeling of regret and they'd like to avoid it, they're much more likely\nto take their medications. Harnessing that sense\nof hating regret works. And it leads to the more general point, which is: once you recognize\nhow people are irrational, you're in a much better\nposition to help them. Now, this kind of irrationality works out\neven in men's restrooms. So, for those of you\nwho don't frequent urinals, let me break this down for you. (Laughter) There is pee all over the floor. (Laughter) And it turns out that you\ncan solve this problem by etching the image of a fly\nin the back of the urinal. (Laughter) (Applause) And it makes perfect sense. (Laughter) If I see a fly, I'm gonna get that fly. (Laughter) That fly is going down. (Laughter) Now, this naturally begs the question\nthat if men can aim, why were they peeing\non the floor in the first place? In fact, if they were going\nto pee on the floor, why pee in front of the urinal? You could pee anywhere. (Laughter) And the same thing works in health care. We had a problem in our hospital in which the physicians\nwere prescribing brand-name drugs when a generic drug was available. Each one of the lines on this graph\nrepresents a different drug. And they're listed according to how often\nthey're prescribed as generic medications. Those are the top are prescribed\nas generics 100 percent of the time. Those down at the bottom\nare prescribed as generics less than 20 percent of the time. And we'd have meetings with clinicians\nand all sorts of education sessions, and nothing worked -- all the lines are pretty much horizontal. Until, someone installed\na little piece of software in the electronic health record that defaulted the prescriptions\nto generic medications instead of the brand-name drugs. Now, it doesn't take a statistician to see that this problem\nwas solved overnight, and it has stayed solved ever since. In fact, in the two and a half years\nsince this program started, our hospital has saved 32 million dollars. Let me say that again: 32 million dollars. And all we did was make it easier for the doctors to do what they\nfundamentally wanted to do all along. It also works to play into\npeople's notions of loss. We did this with a contest\nto help people walk more. We wanted everyone to walk\nat least 7,000 steps, and we measured their step count with the accelerometer\non their cell phone. Group A, the control group,\njust got told whether they had walked 7,000 steps or not. Group B got a financial incentive. We gave them $1.40 for every day\nthey walked 7,000 steps. Group C got the same financial incentive, but it was framed as a loss\nrather than a gain: $1.40 a day is 42 dollars a month, so we gave these participants 42 dollars\nat the beginning of each month in a virtual account that they could see, and we took away $1.40 for every day\nthey didn't walk 7,000 steps. Now, an economist would say\nthat those two financial incentives are the same. For every day you walk 7,000 steps,\nyou're $1.40 richer. But a behavioral economist\nwould say that they're different, because we're much more motivated\nto avoid a $1.40 loss than we are motivated\nto achieve a $1.40 gain. And that's exactly what happened. Those in the group that received $1.40\nfor every day they walked 7,000 steps were no more likely to meet their goal\nthan the control group. The financial incentive didn't work. But those who had a loss-framed incentive met their goal 50 percent\nmore of the time. It doesn't make economic sense,\nbut it makes psychological sense, because losses loom larger than gains. And now we're using loss-framed incentives\nto help patients walk more, lose weight and take their medications. Money can be a motivator. We all know that. But it's far more influential\nwhen it's paired with psychology. And money, of course,\nhas its own disadvantages. My favorite example of this\ninvolves a daycare program. The greatest sin you can commit in daycare\nis picking up your kids late. No one is happy. Your kids are crying\nbecause you don't love them. (Laughter) The teachers are unhappy\nbecause they leave work late. And you feel terribly guilty. This daycare program in Israel\ndecided they wanted to stop this problem, and they did something that many\ndaycare programs in the US do, which is they installed\na fine for late pickups. And the fine they chose was 10 shekels, which is about three bucks. And guess what happened? Late pickups increased. And if you think about it,\nit makes perfect sense. What a deal! For 10 shekels -- (Laughter) you can keep my kids all night! (Laughter) They took a perfectly strong\nintrinsic motivation not to be late, and they cheapened it. What's worse, when they\nrealized their mistake and they took away\nthe financial incentive, the late pickups still stayed\nat the high level. They had already poisoned\nthe social contract. Health care is full\nof strong intrinsic motivations. We have doctors and patients\nwho already want to do the right thing. Financial incentives can help, but we shouldn't expect\nmoney in health care to do all of the heavy lifting. Instead, perhaps the most powerful\ninfluencers of health behavior are our social interactions. Social engagement works in health care, and it works in two directions. First, we fundamentally care\nwhat others think of us. And so one of the most powerful ways\nto change our behavior is to make our activities\nwitnessable to others. We behave differently\nwhen we're being observed than when we're not. I've been to some restaurants\nthat don't have sinks in the bathrooms. Instead, when you step out,\nthe sink is outside in the main part of the restaurant, where everyone can see\nwhether you wash your hands or not. Now, I don't know for sure, but I am convinced\nthat handwashing is much greater in those particular settings. We are always on our best behavior\nwhen we're being observed. In fact, there was this amazing study that was done in an intensive care unit\nin a Florida hospital. The handwashing rates were very low,\nwhich is dangerous, of course, because it can spread infection. And so some researchers pasted\na picture of someone's eyes over the sink. It wasn't a real person,\nit was just a photograph. In fact, it wasn't even their whole face,\nit was just their eyes looking at you. (Laughter) Handwashing rates more than doubled. It seems we care so much\nwhat other people think of us that our behavior improves even if we merely imagine\nthat we're being observed. And not only do we care\nwhat others think of us, we fundamentally model our behaviors\non what we see other people do. And it all comes back to seat belts. When I was a kid, I used to love\nthe \"Batman\" TV series with Adam West. Everything that Batman\nand Robin did was so cool, and, of course, the Batmobile\nwas the coolest thing of all. Now, that show aired from 1966 to 1968, and at that time, seat belts\nwere optional accessories in cars. But the producers of that show\ndid something really important. When Batman and Robin\ngot in the Batmobile, the camera would focus on their laps, and you would see Batman and Robin\nput on their seat belts. Now, if Batman and Robin\nput on their seat belts, you can bet that I was going to wear\nmy seat belt, too. I bet that show saved thousands of lives. And again, it works in health care, too. Doctors use antibiotics more appropriately\nwhen they see how other doctors use them. So many activities in health care\nare hidden, they're unwitnessed, but doctors are social animals, and they perform better\nwhen they see what other doctors do. So social influence works in health care. So does tying it to notions of regret\nor to loss aversion. We would never think of using these tools\nif we thought that everyone was rational all the time. Now, just to be clear:\nI am not condemning rationality. I mean, that really would be irrational. But we all know that it's\nthe nonrational parts of our minds where we get courage,\ncreativity, inspiration and everything else that sparks passion. And we know something else, too. We know that we can be much more effective\nat improving health behavior if we work with the irrational\nparts of our nature instead of ignoring them\nor fighting against them. When it comes to health care, understanding our irrationality\nis just another tool in our toolbox. And harnessing that irrationality -- that may be the most rational move of all. Thank you.

{"page": 81, "lesson": 22, "title": "Should you care what your parents think?", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/would-you-stop-dating-someone-your-parents-didn-t-like", "transcript": {"en": "If I told you not to press \nthis big red button, what would you do? For many people, there’s no greater\nmotivation to do something than being told they can’t. So, what is it about being told “no”\nthat triggers this response? One of the most enduring explanations\nfor this behavior is what psychologists\ncall reactance theory. Reactance is a motivational state \nthat occurs when people feel their freedom \nis being threatened, and it compels them to take actions \nthey see as restoring that freedom. Sometimes this emerges as \ngeneral frustration or direct argument, but the most straightforward response is to simply do the thing \nthey were told not to. This behavior plays out in public spaces, like when people ignore health campaigns\nthey perceive as overbearing, and in private spaces,\nlike parent-child relationships. However, there are situations \nwhere something being forbidden actually makes it less tempting. In 1972, psychologists \nat the University of Colorado wanted to know if a romantic relationship \nfacing parental disapproval was more likely to strengthen \nor crumble under the pressure. To answer this question, \nthey surveyed 140 couples, varying widely in measures of happiness, but all fairly serious \nin terms of commitment. Only some couples reported perceived\nparental opposition to their relationship over the study’s six-month period. But those that did also reported \na steady increase in love for one another. The researchers named this trend\nthe Romeo and Juliet Effect after literature’s most famous\nforbidden lovers and concluded that the results were\nlargely motivated by reactance. But in the decades since this publication, most follow-up studies have suggested\nthe opposite is true. In fact, the long-term success \nof a romantic relationship can be predicted by the perceived\napproval or disapproval of the couple’s friends and family. This trend is known \nas the Social Network Effect. So why doesn’t reactance win \nout over the Social Network Effect? You might think it’s because we value \nour existing relationships over our potential relationships. But in most cases, \ndisapproving friends and family are just voicing negative opinions or \npassively not supporting a relationship. It’s rarely a dramatic choice \nof us or them. And when it comes to parents, most people with good relationships \nwith their parents feel they can ignore their parent’s advice\nwithout serious consequences, while people with \nbad parental relationships often don’t care what they think anyway. So if disapproved relationships are \nmore likely to fail, does this mean we’re not willing\nto fight to date who we want? Well, it might vary from person to person. One theory is that there’s actually \ntwo types of reactance: defiant reactance, which is impulsively \ndoing the opposite of what we’re told, and independent reactance, which reflects\nour deeper desire to make our own choices. For example, if you tell someone with high\ndefiant reactance to lower their voice, they’ll probably start shouting. Whereas someone with high independent\nreactance is more likely to simply ignore the request \nand do what they believe is appropriate. So when it comes \nto relationship disapproval, a defiant person might respond by pursuing\ntheir romance in secret, but that doesn’t change \nhow the group’s opinion negatively impacts their relationship. Conversely, someone with a particularly\nindependent personality might be capable of ignoring their friends’ concerns\nand loving whomever they want. The idea of defiant and independent\nreactance is fairly new, and researchers are still working \nto uncover all the motivations behind the Social Network Effect. But these theories help illuminate \nthe important relationship between reactance and our competing needs\nfor independence and inclusion. How we balance these desires varies\nacross individuals and cultures. But no matter how prone \nto reactance we may be, our social networks are vital \nto our sense of identity and well-being. This is especially true \nin our romantic relationships. Studies have found that support \nfrom a few close companions can help buffer against disapproval \nfrom others. And most relationships do better \nonce the individuals involved find supportive social networks. This outcome might not seem as romantic\nas a forbidden love affair, but it’s actually in keeping \nwith the story of Romeo and Juliet, whose embattled relationship couldn't\nendure the threats of extreme disapproval."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Reactance is a motivational state that occurs when ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "People feel their safety is being threatened"}, {"label": "B", "text": "People feel their freedom is being threatened"}, {"label": "C", "text": "People feel their identity is being threatened"}, {"label": "D", "text": "People feel their personal space is being threatened"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The trend showing a couple's bond strengthening in response to parental opposition is called ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Reactance Effect"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Rebellion Effect"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Romeo and Juliet Effect"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Sid and Nancy Effect"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does the Social Network Effect indicate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Approval of friends and family is a strong determiner of a relationship's long-term success."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Individuals are most likely to marry within their friendship circle.

{"page": 81, "lesson": 23, "title": "How do carbohydrates impact your health? - Richard J. Wood", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-carbohydrates-impact-your-health-richard-j-wood", "transcript": {"en": "Which of these has \nthe least carbohydrates? This roll of bread? This bowl of rice? Or this can of soda? It's a trick question. Although they may differ in fats,\nvitamins, and other nutritional content, when it comes to carbs,\nthey're pretty much the same. So what exactly does that mean\nfor your diet? First of all, carbohydrate is \nthe nutritional category for sugars and molecules that your body breaks down\nto make sugars. Carbohydrates can be simple or complex\ndepending on their structure. This is a simple sugar,\nor monosaccharide. Glucose, fructose, \nand galactose are all simple sugars. Link two of them together,\nand you've got a disaccharide, lactose, maltose, or sucrose. Complex carbohydrates,\non the other hand, have three or more simple sugars\nstrung together. Complex carbohydrates with three\nto ten linked sugars are oligosaccharides. Those with more than ten\nare polysaccharides. During digestion, your body breaks down those\ncomplex carbohydrates into their monosaccharide building blocks, which your cells can use for energy. So when you eat \nany carbohydrate-rich food, the sugar level in your blood,\nnormally about a teaspoon, goes up. But your digestive tract doesn't respond\nto all carbohydrates the same. Consider starch and fiber, both polysaccharides, both derived from plants, both composed of hundreds to thousands\nof monosaccharides joined together, but they're joined together differently, and that changes the effect \nthey have on your body. In starches, which plants mostly store\nfor energy in roots and seeds, glucose molecules are joined together\nby alpha linkages, most of which can be easily cleaved\nby enzymes in your digestive tract. But in fiber, the bonds between\nmonosaccharide molecules are beta bonds, which your body can't break down. Fiber can also trap some starches,\npreventing them from being cleaved, resulting in something called\nresistant starch. So foods high in starch,\nlike crackers and white bread, are digested easily, quickly releasing a whole bunch of glucose\ninto your blood, exactly what would happen if you drank\nsomething high in glucose, like soda. These foods have a high glycemic index, the amount that a particular food\nraises the sugar level in your blood. Soda and white bread have a similar\nglycemic index because they have a similar effect\non your blood sugar. But when you eat foods high in fiber,\nlike vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, those indigestible beta bonds slow \nthe release of glucose into the blood. Those foods have a lower glycemic index, and foods like eggs, cheese, and meats\nhave the lowest glycemic index. When sugar moves from the digestive tract\nto the blood stream, your body kicks into action to transfer it\ninto your tissues where it can be processed \nand used for energy. Insulin, a hormone \nsynthesized in the pancreas, is one of the body's main tools\nfor sugar management. When you eat and your blood sugar rises, insulin is secreted into the blood. It prompts your muscle and fat cells\nto let glucose in and jump starts the conversion\nof sugar to energy. The degree to which a unit\nof insulin lowers the blood sugar helps us understand something called\ninsulin sensitivity. The more a given unit of insulin\nlowers blood sugar, the more sensitive you are to insulin. If insulin sensitivity goes down,\nthat's known as insulin resistance. The pancreas still sends out insulin, but cells, especially muscle cells,\nare less and less responsive to it, so blood sugar fails to decrease, and blood insulin continues to rise. Chronically consuming \na lot of carbohydrates may lead to insulin resistance, and many scientists believe\nthat insulin resistance leads to a serious condition\ncalled metabolic syndrome. That involves a constellation of symptoms, including high blood sugar, increased waist circumference, and high blood pressure. It increases the risk \nof developing conditions, like cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes. And its prevalence is rapidly increasing\nall over the world. As much as 32% of the population\nin the U.S. has metabolic syndrome. So let's get back to your diet. Whether your food tastes sweet or not,\nsugar is sugar, and too many carbs can be a problem.

Together, they form the gut microbiome, a rich ecosystem that performs a variety\nof functions in our bodies. The bacteria in our guts\ncan break down food the body can't digest, produce important nutrients, regulate the immune system, and protect against harmful germs. We don't yet have the blueprint for exactly which good bacteria \na robust gut needs, but we do know that it's important\nfor a healthy microbiome to have a variety of bacterial species. Many factors affect our microbiomes, including our environment, medications like antibiotics, and even whether we were delivered\nby C-section or not. Diet, too, is emerging as one \nof the leading influences on the health of our guts. And while we can't control all \nthese factors, we can manipulate the balance\nof our microbes by paying attention to what we eat. Dietary fiber from foods like fruits, \nvegetables, nuts, legumes, and whole grains is the best fuel for gut bacteria. When bacteria digest fiber, they produce short chain fatty acids\nthat nourish the gut barrier, improve immune function, and can help prevent inflammation,\nwhich reduces the risk of cancer. And the more fiber you ingest, the more fiber-digesting bacteria\ncolonize your gut. In a recent study, scientists exchanged\nthe regular high-fiber diets of a group of rural South Africans with the high-fat, meat-heavy diets\nof a group of African-Americans. After just two weeks on the high-fat,\nlow-fiber, Western-style diet, the rural African group showed\nincreased inflammation of the colon, as well as a decrease of butyrate. That's a short chain fatty acid thought\nto lower risk of colon cancer. Meanwhile, the group that switched\nto a high-fiber, low-fat diet had the opposite result. So what goes wrong with our gut bacteria \nwhen we eat low-fiber processed foods? Lower fiber means less fuel\nfor the gut bacteria, essentially starving them \nuntil they die off. This results in less diversity and hungry bacteria. In fact, some can even start to feed\non the mucus lining. We also know that specific foods \ncan affect gut bacteria. In one recent microbiome study, scientists found that fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, red wine, and dark chocolate were correlated with \nincreased bacterial diversity. These foods contain polyphenols, which are naturally occurring \nantioxidant compounds. On the other hand, foods high in dairy fat, like whole milk, and sugar-sweetened sodas were correlated with decreased diversity. How food is prepared also matters. Minimally processed, fresh foods\ngenerally have more fiber and provide better fuel. So lightly steamed, sautéed, or raw vegetables are typically more beneficial\nthan fried dishes. There are also ways of preparing food\nthat can actually introduce good bacteria, also known as probiotics,\ninto your gut. Fermented foods are teeming\nwith helpful probiotic bacteria, like lactobacillus and bifidobacteria. Originally used as a way \nof preserving foods before the invention of refrigeration, fermentation remains a traditional\npractice all over the world. Foods like kimchi, sauerkraut, tempeh, and kombucha provide variety and vitality\nto our diets. Yogurt is another fermented food that can\nintroduce helpful bacteria into our guts. That doesn't necessarily mean that\nall yogurt is good for us, though. Brands with too much sugar\nand not enough bacteria may not actually help. These are just general guidelines. More research is needed before \nwe fully understand exactly how any of these foods\ninteract with our microbiomes. We see positive correlations, but the insides of our guts are difficult\nplaces to make direct observations. For instance, we don't currently know whether these foods are directly\nresponsible for the changes in diversity, or if something more complicated\nis happening. While we're only beginning to explore\nthe vast wilderness inside our guts, we already have a glimpse of how crucial\nour microbiomes are for digestive health. The great news is we have the power\nto fire up the bacteria in our bellies. Fill up on fibers, fresh and fermented foods, and you can trust your gut\nto keep you going strong."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "All of the following foods are good sources of fiber except:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bananas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kale"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eggs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Almonds"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In recent studies, all of the following foods were correlated with increased bacterial diversity except:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fruits"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Vegetables"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Red wine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dark chocolate"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Whole milk"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "All of the following vegetable preparation methods help provide more fuel for gut bacteria except:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Steaming"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Boiling"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Frying"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Preparing raw vegetables"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "All of the following are examples of fermented foods except:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A variety of fermented vegetables like kimchi and sauerkraut"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tempeh"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All pickles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Kombucha"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Helpful probiotic bacteria found in many foods and supplements include:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "E. coli"}, {"label": "B", "text": "H. pylori"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Clostridium difficile"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
