The tulips looks great.\" Have you ever wondered\nhow your dog experiences the world? Here's what she sees. Not terribly interesting. But what she smells,\nthat's a totally different story. And it begins at her wonderfully \ndeveloped nose. As your dog catches \nthe first hints of fresh air, her nose's moist, spongy outside helps\ncapture any scents the breeze carries. The ability to smell \nseparately with each nostril, smelling in stereo, helps to determine the direction \nof the smell's source so that within the first \nfew moments of sniffing, the dog starts to become aware of not\njust what kind of things are out there but also where they're located. As air enters the nose, a small fold of tissue \ndivides it into two separate folds, one for breathing \nand one just for smelling. This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized \nolfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them,\ncompaired to our five million. And unlike our clumsy way of breathing \nin and out through the same passage, dogs exhale through slits \nat the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help\ndraw in new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up\nover mulitple sniffs. But all that impressive nasal architecture\nwouldn't be much help without something to process the loads\nof information the nose scoops up. And it turns out that the olfactory system\ndedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative\nbrain area in dogs than in humans. All of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering \nvariety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times\nless than what our noses can detect. If you can smell a spritz of perfume\nin a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it\nin an enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients,\nto boot. And everything in the street,\nevery passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling\nyour dog what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in. Besides being much \nmore powerful than ours, a dog's sense of smell can pick up things\nthat can't even be seen at all. A whole separate olfactory system, called the vomeronasal organ,\nabove the roof of the mouth, detects the hormones all animals,\nIncluding humans, naturally release. It lets dogs identify potential mates, or distinguish between friendly \nand hostile animals. It alerts them to our various \nemotional states, and it can even tell them \nwhen someone is pregnant or sick. Because olfaction is more primal \nthan other senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect\ndirectly to the brain structures involving emotion and instinct, we might even say a dog's perception \nis more immediate and visceral than ours. But the most amazing thing about \nyour dog's nose is that it can traverse time. The past appears in tracks \nleft by passersby, and by the warmth \nof a recently parked car where the residue of where you've been\nand what you've done recently. Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards \ncarrying messages of who's been by, what they've been eating, and how they're feeling. And the future is in the breeze, alerting them to something or someone\napproaching long before you see them. Where we see and hear something\nat a single moment, a dog smells an entire story\nfrom start to finish. In some of the best examples\nof canine-human collaboration, dogs help us by sharing\nand reacting to those stories. They can respond with kindness\nto people in distress, or with aggression to threats because stress and anger \nmanifest as a cloud of hormones recognizable to the dog's nose. With the proper training, they can even alert us \nto invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer. As it turns out, humanity's best friend is not one who experiences \nthe same things we do, but one whose incredible nose reveals \na whole other world beyond our eyes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What does a vomeronasal organ do for dogs?

Virgo", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-does-your-smartphone-know-your-location-wilton-l-virgo", "transcript": {"en": "How does your smartphone\nknow exactly where you are? The answer lies 12,000 miles \nover your head in an orbiting satellite that keeps time\nto the beat of an atomic clock powered by quantum mechanics. Phew. Let's break that down. First of all, why is it so important \nto know what time it is on a satellite when location is what\nwe're concerned about? The first thing \nyour phone needs to determine is how far it is from a satellite. Each satellite constantly \nbroadcasts radio signals that travel from space to your phone\nat the speed of light. Your phone records \nthe signal arrival time and uses it to calculate \nthe distance to the satellite using the simple formula,\ndistance = c x time, where c is the speed of light\nand time is how long the signal traveled. But there's a problem. Light is incredibly fast. If we were only able to calculate \ntime to the nearest second, every location on Earth, and far beyond, would seem to be the same \ndistance from the satellite. So in order to calculate that distance\nto within a few dozen feet, we need the best clock ever invented. Enter atomic clocks,\nsome of which are so precise that they would not gain or lose a second even if they ran \nfor the next 300 million years. Atomic clocks work \nbecause of quantum physics. All clocks must have a constant frequency. In other words, a clock must carry out\nsome repetitive action to mark off equivalent increments of time. Just as a grandfather clock \nrelies on the constant swinging back and forth of a pendulum \nunder gravity, the tick tock of an atomic clock is maintained by the transition \nbetween two energy levels of an atom. This is where quantum physics \ncomes into play. Quantum mechanics \nsays that atoms carry energy, but they can't take on \njust any arbitrary amount. Instead, atomic energy \nis constrained to a precise set of levels. We call these quanta. As a simple analogy, \nthink about driving a car onto a freeway. As you increase your speed, you would normally continuously go \nfrom, say, 20 miles/hour up to 70 miles/hour. Now, if you had a quantum atomic car, you wouldn't accelerate \nin a linear fashion. Instead, you would instantaneously jump,\nor transition, from one speed to the next. For an atom, when a transition \noccurs from one energy level to another, quantum mechanics says that the energy difference \nis equal to a characteristic frequency, multiplied by a constant, where the change in energy is equal to \na number, called Planck's constant, times the frequency. That characteristic frequency \nis what we need to make our clock. GPS satellites rely on cesium and rubidium\natoms as frequency standards. In the case of cesium 133, the characteristic clock frequency\nis 9,192,631,770 Hz. That's 9 billion cycles per second. That's a really fast clock. No matter how skilled a clockmaker may be, every pendulum, wind-up mechanism and quartz crystal resonates \nat a slightly different frequency. However, every cesium 133 atom \nin the universe oscillates at the same exact frequency. So thanks to the atomic clock, we get a time reading accurate\nto within 1 billionth of a second, and a very precise measurement\nof the distance from that satellite. Let's ignore the fact that you're almost\ndefinitely on Earth. We now know that you're at a fixed \ndistance from the satellite. In other words, you're somewhere \non the surface of a sphere centered around the satellite. Measure your distance \nfrom a second satellite and you get another overlapping sphere. Keep doing that, and with just four measurements, and a little correction \nusing Einstein's theory of relativity, you can pinpoint your location to exactly\none point in space. So that's all it takes: a multibillion-dollar \nnetwork of satellites, oscillating cesium atoms, quantum mechanics, relativity, a smartphone, and you.

{"page": 47, "lesson": 5, "title": "The French Revolution: Crash Course World History #29", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/ibHbat6F", "transcript": {"en": "Hi, my name is John Green, this is Crash Course\nWorld History, and today we’re going to talk about The French Revolution. Admittedly,\nthis wasn’t the French flag until 1794, but we just felt like he looked good in stripes.\nAs does this guy. Huh? So, while the American Revolution is considered\na pretty good thing, the French Revolution is often seen as a bloody, anarchic mess,\nwhich... Mr. Green, Mr. Green! I bet, like always,\nit’s way more complicated than that. Actually no. It was pretty terrible. Also,\nlike a lot of revolutions, in the end it exchanged an authoritarian regime for an authoritarian\nregime. But even if the revolution was a mess, its ideas changed human history - far more,\nI will argue, than the American Revolution. [theme music] Right, so France in the 18th century was a\nrich and populous country, but it had a systemic problem collecting taxes because of the way\nits society was structured. They had a system with kings and nobles we now call the Ancien\nRégime. Thank you, three years of high school French. And for most French people, it sucked, because\nthe people with the money - the nobles and the clergy - never paid taxes. So by 1789,\nFrance was deeply in debt thanks to their funding the American Revolution - thank you,\nFrance; we will get you back in World Wars I and II. And King Louis XVI was spending\nhalf of his national budget to service the federal debt. Louis tried to reform this system under various\nfinance ministers. He even called for democracy on a local level, but all attempts to fix\nit failed and soon France basically declared bankruptcy. This nicely coincided with hailstorms\nthat ruined a year’s harvest, thereby raising food prices and causing widespread hunger, which really made\nthe people of France angry, because they love to eat. Meanwhile, the King certainly did not look\nbroke, as evidenced by his well-fed physique and fancy footwear. He and his wife Marie\nAntoinette also got to live in the very nice Palace at Versailles thanks to God’s mandate,\nbut Enlightenment thinkers like Kant were challenging the whole idea of religion, writing\nthings like: “The main point of enlightenment is of man’s release from his self-caused\nimmaturity, primarily in matters of religion.” So basically the peasants were hungry, the\nintellectuals were beginning to wonder whether God could or should save the King, and the\nnobility were dithering about, eating foie gras and songbirds, failing to make meaningful\nfinancial reform. In response to the crisis, Louis XVI called\na meeting of the Estates General, the closest thing that France had to a national parliament,\nwhich hadn’t met since 1614. The Estates General was like a super parliament made up\nof representatives from the First Estate, the nobles, the Second Estate, the clergy,\nand the Third Estate, everyone else. The Third Estate showed up with about 600\nrepresentatives, the First and Second Estates both had about 300, and after several votes,\neverything was deadlocked, and then the Third Estate was like, “You know what? Forget\nyou guys. We’re gonna leave and we’re gonna become our own National Assembly.” This did not please King Louis XVI. So when\nthe new National Assembly left the room for a break, he locked the doors, and he was like,\n\"Sorry, guys, you can't go in there. And if you can't assemble, how you gonna be a National\nAssembly?\" Shockingly, the Third Estate representatives\nwere able to find a different room in France, this time an indoor tennis court where they\nswore the famous Tennis Court Oath. And they agreed not to give up until a French constitution\nwas established. So then Louis XVI responded by sending troops\nto Paris primarily to quell uprisings over food shortages, but the revolutionaries saw\nthis as a provocation, so they responded by seizing the Bastille Prison on July 14th,\nwhich, coincidentally, is also Bastille Day. The Bastille was stormed ostensibly to free\nprisoners - although there were only seven in jail at the time - but mostly to get guns. But the really radical move in the National\nAssembly came on August 4, when they abolished most of the Ancien Régime - feudal rights,\ntithes, privileges for nobles, unequal taxation, they were all abolished - in the name of writing\na new constitution. And then, on August 26th, the National Assembly\nproclaimed the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen, which laid out a system of rights\nthat applied to every person, and made those rights integral to the new constitution. That’s\nquite different from the American bill of rights, which was, like, begrudgingly tacked\non at the end and only applied to non-slaves. The DoRoMaC, as I called it in high school,\ndeclared that everyone had the right to liberty, property, and security - rights that the French\nRevolution would do an exceptionally poor job of protecting, but as noted last week,\nthe same can be argued for many other supposedly more successful revolutions. Okay, let’s\ngo to the Thought Bubble. Meanwhile, back at Versailles, Louis XVI was\nstill King of France, and it was looking like France might be a constitutional monarchy.\nWhich might've meant that the royal family could hang on to their awesome house, but\nthen, in October of 1789, a rumor started that Marie Antoinette was hoarding grain somewhere\ninside the palace. And in what became known as the Women's March,\na bunch of armed peasant women stormed the palace and demanded that Louis and Marie Antoinette\nmove from Versailles to Paris. Which they did, because everyone is afraid of armed peasant\nwomen. And this is a nice reminder that to many people at the time, the French Revolution\nwas not primarily about fancy Enlightenment ideas; it was mostly about lack of food and\na political system that made economic contractions hardest on the poor. Now, a good argument can be made that this\nfirst phase of the revolution wasn’t all that revolutionary. The National Assembly\nwanted to create a constitutional monarchy; they believed that the king was necessary\nfor a functioning state and they were mainly concerned that the voters and office holders\nbe men of property. Only the most radical wing, the Jacobins, called for the creation\nof a republic. But things were about to get much more revolutionary - and also worse for\nFrance. First, the Jacobins had a huge petition drive\nthat got a bit unruly, which led troops controlled not by the King but by the National Assembly\nto fire on the crowd, killing 50 people. And that meant that the National Assembly, which\nhad been the revolutionary voice of the people, had killed people in an attempt to reign in\nrevolutionary fervor. You see this a lot throughout history during revolutions. What looked like\nradical hope and change suddenly becomes \"The Man\" as increasingly radical ideas are embraced.\nThanks, Thought Bubble. Meanwhile, France’s monarchical neighbors\nwere getting a little nervous about all this republic business, especially Leopold II,\nwho in addition to being the not holy, not Roman, and not imperial Holy Roman Emperor,\nwas Marie Antoinette’s brother. I should note, by the way, that at this point, the\nHoly Roman Empire was basically just Austria. Also, like a lot of monarchs, Leopold II liked\nthe idea of monarchies, and he wanted to keep his job as a person who gets to stand around\nwearing a dress, pointing at nothing, owning winged lion-monkeys made out of gold. And who\ncan blame him? So he and King William Frederick II of Prussia together issued the Declaration of Pillnitz,\nwhich promised to restore the French monarchy. At this point, Louis and the National Assembly\ndeveloped a plan: Let’s invade Austria. The idea was to plunder Austria’s wealth\nand maybe steal some Austrian grain to shore up French food supplies, and also, you know,\nspread revolutionary zeal. But what actually happened is that Prussia joined Austria in\nfighting the French. And then Louis encouraged the Prussians, which made him look like an\nenemy of the revolution, which, of course, he was. And as a result, the Assembly voted\nto suspend the monarchy, have new elections in which everyone could vote (as long as they\nwere men), and create a new republican constitution. Soon, this Convention decided to have a trial\nfor Louis XVI, who was found guilty and, by one vote, sentenced to die via guillotine.\nWhich made it difficult for Austria and Prussia to restore him to the throne. Oh, it’s time\nfor the open letter? An Open Letter to the Guillotine. But first,\nlet’s see what’s in the secret compartment today. Oh, there’s nothing. Oh my gosh, Stan! Jeez.\nThat’s not funny! Dear Guillotine, I can think of no better example of\nEnlightenment thinking run amok. Dr. Joseph Guillotine, the inventor of the guillotine, envisioned\nit as an egalitarian way of dying. They said the guillotine was humane and it also made\nno distinction between rich or poor, noble or peasant. It killed equally. You were also celebrated for taking the torture\nout of execution. But I will remind you, you did not take the dying out of execution. Unfortunately\nfor you, France hasn’t executed anyone since 1977. But you’ll be happy to know that the\nlast legal execution in France was via guillotine. Plus, you’ve always got a future in horror\nmovies. Best wishes, John Green The death of Louis XVI marks the beginning\nof The Terror, the best known or at least the most sensational phase of the revolution.\nI mean, if you can kill the king, you can kill pretty much anyone, which is what the\ngovernment did under the leadership of the Committee of Public Safety (Motto: We suck at\nprotecting public safety), led by Maximilien Robespierre. The terror saw the guillotining of 16,000\nenemies of the revolution including Marie “I never actually said Let them eat cake”\nAntoinette and Maximilien Robespierre himself, who was guillotined in the month of Thermidor\nin the year Two. Alright, so while France was broke and fighting\nin like nine wars, the Committee of Public Safety changed the measurements of time because,\nyou know, the traditional measurements are so irrational and religion-y. So they renamed\nall the months and decided that every day would have 10 hours and each hour 100 minutes. And then, after the Terror, the revolution\npulled back a bit and another new constitution was put into place, this one giving a lot\nmore power to wealthy people. At this point, France was still at war with Austria and Britain,\nwars that France ended up winning, largely thanks to a little corporal named Napoleon\nBonaparte. The war was backdrop to a bunch of coups and\ncounter coups that I won’t get into right now because they were very complicated, but\nthe last coup that we’ll talk about, in 1799, established Napoleon Bonaparte as the\nFirst Consul of France. And it granted him almost unlimited executive power under yet\nanother constitution. And when he was declared First Consul of France, Napoleon proclaimed\n\"Citizens! The revolution is established on the principals with which it began. It is\nover.\" By which he presumably meant that France’s government had gone all the way from here\nto here to here. As with the American revolution, it’s easy\nto conclude that France’s revolution wasn’t all that revolutionary. I mean, Napoleon was\nbasically an emperor and, in some ways, he was even more of an absolute monarch than\nLouis XVI had been. Gradually the nobles came back to France, although they had mostly lost\ntheir special privileges. The Catholic Church returned, too, although much weaker because\nit had lost land and the ability to collect tithes. And when Napoleon himself fell, France restored\nthe monarchy, and except for a four-year period, between 1815 and 1870, France had a king who\nwas either a Bourbon or a Bonaparte. Now, these were no longer absolute monarchs who\nclaimed that their right to rule came from God; they were constitutional monarchs of\nthe kind that the revolutionaries of 1789 had originally envisioned. But the fact remains\nthat France had a king again, and a nobility, and an established religion and it was definitely\nnot a democracy or a republic. And perhaps this is why the French Revolution\nis so controversial and open to interpretation. Some argue the revolution succeeded in spreading\nenlightenment ideals even if it didn’t bring democracy to France. Others argue that the\nreal legacy of the Revolution wasn’t the enhancement of liberty, but of state power. Regardless, I’d argue that the French Revolution\nwas ultimately far more revolutionary than its American counterpart. I mean, in some\nways, America never had an aristocracy, but in other ways it continued to have one - the\nFrench enlightenment thinker, Diderot, felt that Americans should “fear a too unequal\ndivision of wealth resulting in a small number of opulent citizens and a multitude of citizens\nliving in misery.” And the American Revolution did nothing to change that polarization of\nwealth. What made the French Revolution so radical\nwas its insistence on the universality of its ideals. I mean, look at Article 6 of the\nDeclaration of Rights of Man and Citizen: “Law is the expression of the general will.\nEvery citizen has a right to participate personally, or through his representative, in its foundation. It must\nbe the same for all, whether it protects or punishes.” Those are radical ideas, that the laws come\nfrom citizens, not from kings or gods, and that those laws should apply to everyone equally.\nThat’s a long way from Hammurabi - and in truth, it’s a long way from the slaveholding\nThomas Jefferson. In the 1970s, Chinese President Zhou Enlai\nwas asked what the affects of the French Revolution had been. And he said, “It’s too soon\nto say.” And in a way, it still is. The French Revolution asked new questions about\nthe nature of people’s rights and the derivation of those rights. And we’re still answering\nthose questions and sorting through how our answers should shape society today - must\ngovernment be of the people to be for the people? Do our rights derive from nature or\nfrom God or from neither? And what are those rights? As William Faulkner said, “The past is never\ndead. It’s not even past.” Thanks for watching.

My friend, you and your chemical reactions\nhave fallen victim to enthalpy and entropy and, boy, are they forces \nto be reckoned with. Now, your reactants are all products. So, what are these \"E\" words,\nand what's their big idea? Let's start with enthalpy, an increase or decrease of energy\nduring a chemical reaction. Every molecule has a certain amount\nof chemical potential energy stored within the bonds between its atoms. Chemicals with more energy \nare less stable, and thus, more likely to react. Let's visualize the energy flow \nin a reaction, the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen,\nby playing a round of crazy golf. Our goal is to get a ball, the reactant,\nup a small rise and down the other much steeper slope. Where the hill goes up,\nwe need to add energy to the ball, and where it goes down, the ball releases\nenergy into its surroundings. The hole represents the product,\nor result of the reaction. When the reaction period ends,\nthe ball is inside the hole, and we have our product: water. This, like when our oven exploded,\nis an exothermic reaction, meaning that the chemical's final energy\nis less than its starting energy, and the difference has been added\nto the surrounding environment as light and heat. We can also play out\nthe opposite type of reaction, an endothermic reaction, where the final energy is greater \nthan the starting energy. That's what we were trying \nto achieve by baking our cake. The added heat from the oven would \nchange the chemical structure of the proteins in the eggs\nand various compounds in the butter. So that's enthalpy. As you might suspect, exothermic reactions are more likely \nto happen than endothermic ones because they require less energy to occur. But there's another independent factor\nthat can make reactions happen: entropy. Entropy measures a chemical's randomness. Here's an enormous pyramid of golf balls. Its ordered structure \nmeans it has low entropy. However, when it collapses, \nwe have chaos everywhere, balls bouncing high and wide. So much so that some \neven go over the hill. This shift to instability, \nor higher entropy, can allow reactions to happen. As with the golf balls, \nin actual chemicals this transition from structure to disorder\ngets some reactants past the hump and lets them start a reaction. You can see both enthalpy\nand entropy at play when you go to light \na campfire to cook dinner. Your match adds enough energy to activate the exothermic reaction\nof combustion, converting the high-energy \ncombustible material in the wood to lower energy carbon dioxide and water.

We tend to think of blindness\nas something you're born with, but in fact, with many diseases\nlike Retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome, blindness can start developing\nwhen you're a kid, or even when you're an adult. Both of these rare genetic diseases\naffect the retina, the screen at the back of the eye\nthat detects light and helps us see. Now imagine if the eye \ncould regenerate itself so that a blind person could see again. To understand if that's possible,\nwe need to grasp how the retina works and what it has to do \nwith a multitalented creature named the zebrafish. The human retina is made\nof different layers of cells, with special neurons \nthat live in the back of the eye called rod and cone photoreceptors. Photoreceptors convert \nthe light coming into your eye into signals that the brain uses \nto generate vision. People who have Usher syndrome\nand retinitis pigmentosa experience a steady loss \nof these photoreceptors until finally that screen in the eye\ncan no longer detect light nor broadcast signals to the brain. Unlike most of your body's cells,\nphotoreceptors don't divide and multiply. We're born with all \nthe photoreceptors we'll ever have, which is why babies \nhave such big eyes for their faces and part of why they're so cute. But that isn't the case for all animals. Take the zebrafish,\na master regenerator. It can grow back its skin, bones, heart\nand retina after they've been damaged. If photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina\nare removed or killed by toxins, they just regenerate and rewire \nthemselves to the brain to restore sight. Scientists have been investigating\nthis superpower because zebrafish retina are also \nstructured very much like human retina. Scientists can even mimic the effects\nof disorders like Usher syndrome or retinitis pigmentosa\non the zebrafish eye. This allows them to see how zebrafish\ngo about repairing their retinas so they might use similar tactics\nto fix human eyes one day, too. So what's behind \nthe zebrafish's superpower? The main players are sets of long cells\nthat stretch across the retina called Müller glia. When the photoreceptors are damaged,\nthese cells transform, taking on a new character. They become less like Müller cells\nand more like stem cells, which can turn into any kind of cell. Then these long cells divide, producing extras that will eventually\ngrow into new photoreceptors, travel to the back of the eye\nand rewire themselves into the brain. And now some researchers even think\nthey've found the key to how this works with the help of one of two chemicals\nthat create activity in the brain called glutamate\nand aminoadipate. In mouse eyes, these make the Müller glia divide\nand transform into photoreceptors, which then travel \nto the back of the retina, like they're replenishing a failing army\nwith new soldiers. But remember, none of this has happened\nin our retinas yet, so the question is how do we trigger \nthis transformation of the Müller glia in the human eye? How can we fully control this process? How do photoreceptors \nrewire themselves into the retina? And is it even possible \nto trigger this in humans? Or has this mechanism been lost\nover time in evolution? Until we tease apart \nthe origins of this ability, retinal regeneration will remain \na mysterious superpower of the common zebrafish."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The cells in the retina that detect light are called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Muller cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Neuronal cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Photoreceptor cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Zebrafish cells"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Retinitis Pigmentosa and Usher's syndrome cause patients to slowly become", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Blind"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nearsighted"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Farsighted"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "We have all the photoreceptors we'll ever have at:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "20 years old"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10 years old"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5 years old"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Birth"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Before they divide, Muller cells transform to become more like:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stem cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Photoreceptor cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Neuronal cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Glial cells"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Aminoadipate and glutamate make Muller glia:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Become more like stem cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Divide"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both A and B"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neither A nor B"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Jacobs", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-spontaneous-brain-activity-keeps-you-alive-nathan-s-jacobs", "transcript": {"en": "You probably don't need to be told \nhow important your brain is. After all, every single thing \nyou experience, your thoughts and your actions, your perceptions and your memories are processed here \nin your body's control center. But if this already seems like a lot\nfor a single organ to handle, it's actually only a small \npart of what the brain does. Most of its activities are ones \nyou'd never be aware of, unless they suddenly stopped. The brain is made up \nof billions of neurons, and trillions of connections. Neurons can be activated \nby specific stimuli or thoughts, but they are also often \nspontaneously active. Some fire cyclically in a set pattern. Others fire rapidly in short bursts \nbefore switching off, or remain quiet for long periods until thousands of inputs from other \nneurons line up in just the right way. On a large scale, this results in elaborate rhythms \nof internally generated brain activity, humming quietly in the background whether we're awake, asleep, or trying not to think \nabout anything at all. And these spontaneously \noccurring brain functions form the foundation upon which\nall other brain functions rely. The most crucial of these automatically\noccurring activities are the ones that keep us alive. For example, while you've been\npaying attention to this video spontaneous activity in your brain\nhas been maintaining your breathing at 12 to 16 breaths a minute,\nmaking sure that you don't suffocate. Without any conscious effort, signals from parts of your brainstem\nare sent through the spinal cord to the muscles that inflate your lungs, making them expand and contract,\nwhether or not you're paying attention. The neuronal circuits underlying such \nrhythmic spontaneous activity are called central pattern generators, and control many \nsimple repetitive behaviors, like breathing, walking, and swallowing. Ongoing neural activity also underlies\nour sensory perception. It may seem that the neurons in your retina\nthat translate light into neural signals would remain quiet in the dark, but in fact, the retinal ganglion cells \nthat communicate with the brain are always active. And the signals they send are increases \nand decreases in the rate of activity, rather than separate bursts. So at every level, our nervous system\nis teeming with spontaneous activity that helps it interpret and respond\nto any signals it might receive. And our brain's autopilot isn't just \nlimited to our basic biological functions. Have you ever been on the way home, started thinking \nabout what's for dinner, and then realized you don't remember\nwalking for the past five minutes? While we don't understand all the details, we do know that the ongoing activity\nin multiple parts of your brain is somehow able to coordinate \nwhat is actually a complex task involving both cognitive \nand motor functions, guiding you down the right path\nand moving your legs while you're getting dinner figured out. But perhaps the most interesting thing\nabout spontaneous brain function is its involvement in one \nof the most mysterious and poorly understood phenomena\nof our bodies: sleep. You may shut down \nand become inactive at night, but your brain doesn't. While you sleep, ongoing spontaneous activity gradually \nbecomes more and more synchronized, eventually developing into large, \nrhythmic neural oscillations that envelop your brain. This transition to the more \norganized rhythms of sleep starts with small clusters of neurons\ntucked in the hypothalamus. Despite their small number, these neurons have a huge effect in turning off brainstem regions\nthat normally keep you awake and alert, letting other parts, \nlike the cortex and thalamus, slowly slip into their \nown default rhythms. The deeper we fall into sleep, the slower and more synchronized\nthis rhythm becomes, with the deepest stages dominated by large\namplitude, low frequency delta waves. But surprisingly, in the middle \nof this slow wave sleep, the brain's synchronized \nspontaneous activity repeatedly transitions\ninto the sort of varied bursts that occur when we're wide awake. This is the sleep stage\nknown as REM sleep, where our eyes move rapidly \nback and forth as we dream. Neuroscientists are still trying to answer\nmany fundamental questions about sleep, such as its role in rejuvenating\ncognitive capacity, cellular homeostasis, and strengthening memory. And more broadly, they are exploring how it is that brain can accomplish \nsuch important and complex tasks, such as driving, or even breathing,\nwithout our awareness. But for now, until we are better able to understand the inner workings\nof their spontaneous functioning, we need to give our brains credit\nfor being much smarter than we ourselves are."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The brain is made up of _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dozens of neurons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Thousands of neurons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Millions of neurons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Billions of neurons"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The activity of neurons can be produced by specific events, such as a light or sound, but can also occur spontaneously.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following rely on spontaenous neuronal activity?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Breathing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Walking"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Seeing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Neural circuits that produce rhythmic, repetitive patterns of spontaenous activity important for walking and breathing are called _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Central pattern generators"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Small world networks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The default network"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reflex circuits"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When we fall asleep the brain gradually transitions into slow, synchronized patterns of activity.

{"page": 47, "lesson": 9, "title": "How do vaccines work? - Kelwalin Dhanasarnsombut", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-vaccines-work-kelwalin-dhanasarnsombut", "transcript": {"en": "In 1796, the scientist Edward Jenner injected material from a cowpox virus\ninto an eight-year-old boy with a hunch that this would provide\nthe protection needed to save people from deadly outbreaks\nof the related smallpox virus. It was a success. The eight-year-old was inoculated\nagainst the disease and this became the first ever vaccine. But why did it work? To understand how vaccines function, we need to know how the immune system\ndefends us against contagious diseases in the first place. When foreign microbes invade us, the immune system triggers\na series of responses in an attempt to identify\nand remove them from our bodies. The signs that this immune\nresponse is working are the coughing, sneezing,\ninflammation and fever we experience, which work to trap, deter and rid the body\nof threatening things, like bacteria. These innate immune responses\nalso trigger our second line of defense, called adaptive immunity. Special cells called B cells and T cells\nare recruited to fight microbes, and also record information about them, creating a memory of what\nthe invaders look like, and how best to fight them. This know-how becomes handy if the same pathogen\ninvades the body again. But despite this smart response,\nthere's still a risk involved. The body takes time to learn\nhow to respond to pathogens and to build up these defenses. And even then, if a body is too weak or young\nto fight back when it's invaded, it might face very serious risk\nif the pathogen is particularly severe. But what if we could prepare\nthe body's immune response, readying it before someone even got ill? This is where vaccines come in. Using the same principles\nthat the body uses to defend itself, scientists use vaccines to trigger\nthe body's adaptive immune system, without exposing humans\nto the full strength disease. This has resulted in many vaccines,\nwhich each work uniquely, separated into many different types. First, we have live attenuated vaccines. These are made of the pathogen itself\nbut a much weaker and tamer version. Next, we have inactive vaccines,\nin which the pathogens have been killed. The weakening and inactivation\nin both types of vaccine ensures that pathogens don't develop\ninto the full blown disease. But just like a disease,\nthey trigger an immune response, teaching the body to recognize an attack by making a profile\nof pathogens in preparation. The downside is that live attenuated\nvaccines can be difficult to make, and because they're live\nand quite powerful, people with weaker immune systems\ncan't have them, while inactive vaccines\ndon't create long-lasting immunity. Another type, the subunit vaccine, is only made from one part\nof the pathogen, called an antigen, the ingredient that actually triggers\nthe immune response. By even further isolating\nspecific components of antigens, like proteins or polysaccharides, these vaccines can prompt\nspecific responses. Scientists are now building\na whole new range of vaccines called DNA vaccines. For this variety, they isolate the very\ngenes that make the specific antigens the body needs to trigger its immune\nresponse to specific pathogens. When injected into the human body, those genes instruct cells\nin the body to make the antigens. This causes a stronger immune response, and prepares the body\nfor any future threats, and because the vaccine only includes\nspecific genetic material, it doesn't contain any other ingredients\nfrom the rest of the pathogen that could develop into the disease\nand harm the patient. If these vaccines become a success, we might be able to build\nmore effective treatments for invasive pathogens in years to come. Just like Edward Jenner's\namazing discovery spurred on modern medicine\nall those decades ago, continuing the development of vaccines might even allow us\nto treat diseases like HIV, malaria, or Ebola, one day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Edward Jenner succeeded in creating a vaccine against smallpox by injecting patients with material of which disease?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Smallpox"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cowpox"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cattle virus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Measles virus"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the function of innate immune response?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Act very rapid as a first line of defense to eliminate the infection"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Trap microbes so they cannot spread in our body freely"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Coordinate and support adaptive immunity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the main advantage of live attenuated vaccine?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It provides more durable immunity; boosters may be required, though less frequently than would otherwise be necessary"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It is safer than other kinds of vaccines"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It does not cause any severe side effects or complications"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is suitable for people with any type of health"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which is not true about subunit vaccines?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They can be designed using molecular biology technique"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are less harmful than live attenuated vaccine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They generally are made of polypeptide or oligopeptide"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They provide lifetime protection"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Since we have our immune system to protect us from disease, why do we still need a vaccine?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because some diseases are too severe for our immune system"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because adaptive immunity takes days to weeks to initiate a response and sometimes it is too late"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because some people are immune deficient or have weak immune systems"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

In fact, the structures required\nfor such incredible flexibility were once considered so complex that Charles Darwin himself acknowledged\nthat the idea of there having evolved seemed absurd in the \nhighest possible degree. And yet, that is exactly what happened,\nstarting more than 500 million years ago. The story of the human eye begins\nwith a simple light spot, such as the one found \nin single-celled organisms, like euglena. This is a cluster \nof light-sensitive proteins linked to the organism's flagellum, activating when it finds light\nand, therefore, food. A more complex version of this light spot\ncan be found in the flat worm, planaria. Being cupped, rather than flat, enables it to better sense\nthe direction of the incoming light. Among its other uses, this ability allows an organism\nto seek out shade and hide from predators. Over the millenia, as such light cups grew deeper\nin some organisms, the opening at the front grew smaller. The result was a pinhole effect,\nwhich increased resolution dramatically, reducing distortion by only allowing\na thin beam of light into the eye. The nautilus, \nan ancestor of the octopus, uses this pinhole eye for improved \nresolution and directional sensing. Although the pinhole eye allows\nfor simple images, the key step towards the eye \nas we know it is a lens. This is thought to have evolved through transparent cells covering \nthe opening to prevent infection, allowing the inside of the eye\nto fill with fluid that optimizes light sensitivity\nand processing. Crystalline proteins \nforming at the surface created a structure that proved useful in focusing light \nat a single point on the retina. It is this lens that is the key\nto the eye's adaptability, changing its curvature to adapt\nto near and far vision. This structure of the pinhole camera\nwith a lens served as the basis for what would \neventually evolve into the human eye. Further refinements would include\na colored ring, called the iris, that controls the amount \nof light entering the eye, a tough white outer layer,\nknown as the sclera, to maintain its structure, and tear glands that secrete \na protective film. But equally important was the accompanying evolution\nof the brain, with its expansion of the visual cortex to process the sharper\nand more colorful images it was receiving. We now know that far from being\nan ideal masterpiece of design, our eye bares traces\nof its step by step evolution. For example,\nthe human retina is inverted, with light-detecting cells facing away\nfrom the eye opening. This results in a blind spot, where the optic nerve\nmust pierce the retina to reach the photosensitive \nlayer in the back. The similar looking eyes \nof cephalopods, which evolved independently, have a front-facing retina,\nallowing them to see without a blind spot. Other creatures' eyes display\ndifferent adaptations. Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish, have eyes divided in two sections\nfor looking above and under water, perfect for spotting \nboth predators and prey. Cats, classically nighttime hunters,\nhave evolved with a reflective layer maximizing the amount of light\nthe eye can detect, granting them excellent night vision,\nas well as their signature glow. These are just a few examples of the huge \ndiversity of eyes in the animal kingdom. So if you could design an eye, \nwould you do it any differently? This question isn't as strange \nas it might sound. Today, doctors and scientists are looking\nat different eye structures to help design biomechanical implants\nfor the vision impaired. And in the not so distant future, the machines built with the precision\nand flexibilty of the human eye may even enable it to surpass\nits own evolution."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who is quoted to have said that the evolution of the human eye appears \"absurd in the highest possible degree\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Richard Dawkins"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Charles Darwin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gregor Mendel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Isaac Newton"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which organism demonstrates the use of simple light spots?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Euglena"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Planaria"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nautilus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Anablep"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which one of these eyes is the most \"advanced\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cupped disc"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Light spot"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lensed eye"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pin-hole camera"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which animal's eye allows them to see without the blind spot?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cephalopod"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Planaria"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Euglena"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Human"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the explanation for our blind spot?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The lens"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The cornea"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The optic nerve"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An inverted retina"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

So today I'm in California and I have the great privilege of introducing the MAN... Alan Sailer.\n- Hello\n- Alan Sailer is, if you don't know, one of the best high speed photographers that currently does the art. So I'm here in his garden, back behind his house, and we're going to basically study explosions underwater with some firecrackers. (Destin) You typically do it with the high speed photography method right?\n- Yeah it's just a instant of detonation and I'm really looking forward to seeing uh... time.\n- Yeah exactly it's not just one moment. (Destin) This is a M320 Miro Phantom camera and what do you hope to learn here?\n(Alan) I just want to be impressed, so uh.. do it. 3..2..1..0 [bang] Alright! [laughs] - Pretty cool. Let's look at the video. [music] - Oh yeah\n- Ripple.\n- Yeah. OK so we decided we wanted a lower exposure time and also a higher frame rate so what we're gonna do is we're gonna change the lens. 3..2..1..0.. [bang] [falling debris]\n- about 20 feet...\n- Yep. Man the uh.. I wonder if that was from impact or if the bottle itself...\n- No it sucks in... There's cavitation appears on the top if you looked at the photograph.\n-Yeah? Alright let's just look at the video. Alright. I have a scientific mystery that I need your help figuring out. Let's first define what an explosion is. Right? So basically it's a rapid formation of gas and you have it contained in some type of mechanical device and it increases pressure. And that mechanical restraining device will eventually fail and blow outwards, correct? But here's the question. After each shot I would go find the bottle on the ground and the bottle would be sucked in on the top instead of blown out like you would think. This is counter intuitive and we have to figure out why. My theory is that as the bottle blows up on the bottom it begins to shoot up like a rocket, and when it does this it starts to wrinkle like grandma legs if you can see it, as it pushes the rest of the bottle forward. Now the cap has more mass than the side walls of the bottle, so my theory was that the bottle was pushing the cap, but the cap weighs too much and so the bottle is out-running the cap. Alan on the other hand disagreed with me. My position is that after detonation there's nothing but high pressure in the bottle, but Alan referenced me back to some of his photos from his Flickr stream. He always sees bubbles after detonation. Always. What causes bubbles to form in a liquid? Of course. Cavitation. A phase diagram is a fancy chart that uses pressure and temperature to describe what state the matter should be in. We're located about right here which is 23 degrees celcius. Now there's only a couple of ways we can go from liquid over to vapor. One is we can move along the right here and increase the temperature I don't think we're heating the water up enough in order to do that, so I would conclude that Alan is correct. I believe we are lowering the pressure enough that we go beyond this vapor boundary and turn into vapor. And all we have to do to turn it back into a liquid is repressurize. OK let's look at the cavitation. Immediately after detonation we're seeing bubbles all over the bottle. That's interesting but 150 microseconds later on the next frame, all the bubbles seem to be confined in one area. Basically the shock waves are bouncing off the sides of the cylindrical bottle on the inside and they're bouncing back toward each other and then they're interfering with each other and creating a low pressure spot. I think that's pretty cool because you can already see the cap beginning to suck in. On the next frame you can see what I call the \"Wrinkly Grandma Leg Effect.\" Now I think it's pretty interesting that the bubble is collapsing from the left to the right, which might mean that's a compression wave going towards the front of the bottle, but what's confusing to me is the cap of the bottle is still being sucked in. So I convinced Alan to do a self-portrait with me but what I didn't realize is this self-portrait would reveal more information than any of the other videos. At the point of detonation clearly we have high pressure in the bottle. Then you can see the lid suck in and then.. check that out. The lid shoots off. So that implies to me that you have low pressure, and then high pressure. Once the fluid is blown out of the bottom of that bottle, it begins to pull fluid out of the top of the bottle with it. So we have an oscillation in pressure Where have we seen something like that before? Sometimes when I'm drinking with a straw I like to put my finger over the end of the straw and bring the fluid up out of the cup. And then I'll release my finger and watch what the liquid does. It oscillates. That's pretty cool and I think that's caused by fluid momentum or the inertia of the fluid itself. So this momentum effect of fluid applies to what we're doing too. As the fluid is blown out of the bottom of that bottle you can see that it starts to pull liquid out of the top of the bottle and collapse the side walls of the bottle. That's pretty cool too. So seriously, thanks for your time. It's way more fun to think this through with you. Anyway, if you want the high speed footage feel free to download it. Draw me some pictures and show me what you think the shock waves are doing on the video. This guy did it. I don't think he's exactly right but he took a good stab at it. I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one. 2..1..0.. [bang] By the way, Alan Sailer grows very good apricots. The Russians have developed a way to use cavitation to create a bubble on the front of the torpedo. This is called super cavitation. If you fly the torpedo in that bubble you have way less drag and you can move that torpedo way fast.

Passed over even\nfor a lab assistant position, he had to settle for a job\nat the Swiss patent office, obtained with the help\nof a friend's father. Working six days a week as a patent clerk, Einstein still managed to make\nsome time for physics, discussing the latest work\nwith a few close friends, and publishing a couple of minor papers. It came as a major surprise when in March 1905 he submitted\na paper with a shocking hypothesis. Despite decades of evidence\nthat light was a wave, Einstein proposed that it could,\nin fact, be a particle, showing that mysterious phenomena,\nsuch as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by his hypothesis. The idea was derided for years to come, but Einstein was simply\ntwenty years ahead of his time. Wave-particle duality was slated to become\na cornerstone of the quantum revolution. Two months later in May,\nEinstein submitted a second paper, this time tackling the centuries old\nquestion of whether atoms actually exist. Though certain theories were built on\nthe idea of invisible atoms, some prominent scientists still\nbelieved them to be a useful fiction, rather than actual physical objects. But Einstein used an ingenious argument, showing that the behavior\nof small particles randomly moving around in a liquid,\nknown as Brownian motion, could be precisely predicted by the collisions of millions\nof invisible atoms. Experiments soon confirmed\nEinstein's model, and atomic skeptics threw in the towel. The third paper came in June. For a long time, Einstein had been troubled\nby an inconsistency between two fundamental\nprinciples of physics. The well established\nprinciple of relativity, going all the way back to Galileo, stated that absolute motion\ncould not be defined. Yet electromagnetic theory,\nalso well established, asserted that absolute motion did exist. The discrepancy,\nand his inability to resolve it, left Einstein in what he described\nas a state of psychic tension. But one day in May, after he had mulled over the puzzle\nwith his friend Michele Besso, the clouds parted. Einstein realized\nthat the contradiction could be resolved if it was the speed of light\nthat remained constant, regardless of reference frame, while both time and space\nwere relative to the observer. It took Einstein only a few weeks\nto work out the details and formulate what came to be known\nas special relativity. The theory not only shattered\nour previous understanding of reality but would also pave the way\nfor technologies, ranging from particle accelerators, to the global positioning system. One might think that this was enough, but in September, a fourth paper arrived as a \"by the way\"\nfollow-up to the special relativity paper. Einstein had thought a little bit more\nabout his theory, and realized it also implied\nthat mass and energy, one apparently solid\nand the other supposedly ethereal, were actually equivalent. And their relationship could be expressed\nin what was to become the most famous and consequential equation in history: E=mc^2. Einstein would not become a world famous\nicon for nearly another fifteen years. It was only after his later general theory\nof relativity was confirmed in 1919 by measuring the bending of starlight\nduring a solar eclipse that the press would turn him\ninto a celebrity. But even if he had disappeared back\ninto the patent office and accomplished nothing else after 1905, those four papers of his miracle year would have remained the gold standard\nof startling unexpected genius."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Einstein's first \"miracle year\" paper, in March 1905, put forth a surprising idea.

You might even get \na knitted sweater from an aunt. But what if instead of saying \"thanks\"\nbefore consigning it to the closet, the polite response expected from you was to show up to her house \nin a week with a better gift? Or to vote for her in the town election? Or let her adopt your firstborn child? All of these things might not \nsound so strange if you are involved in a gift economy. This phrase might seem contradictory. After all, isn't a gift given for free? But in a gift economy,\ngifts given without explicit conditions are used to foster a system\nof social ties and obligations. While the market economies we know \nare formed by relationships between the things being traded, a gift economy consists \nof the relationships between the people doing the trading. Gift economies have existed \nthroughout human history. The first studies of the concept came from anthropologists \nBronislaw Malinowski and Marcel Mauss who describe the natives \nof the Trobriand islands making dangerous canoe journeys \nacross miles of ocean to exchange shell necklaces\nand arm bands. The items traded through this process,\nknown as the kula ring, have no practical use, but derive importance \nfrom their original owners and carry an obligation \nto continue the exchange. Other gift economies \nmay involve useful items, such as the potlatch feast \nof the Pacific Northwest, where chiefs compete for prestige \nby giving away livestock and blankets. We might say that instead \nof accumulating material wealth, participants in a gift economy \nuse it to accumulate social wealth. Though some instances of gift economies\nmay resemble barter, the difference is that the original gift \nis given without any preconditions or haggling. Instead, the social norm of reciprocity obligates recipients to voluntarily \nreturn the favor. But the rules for how and when to do so \nvary between cultures, and the return on a gift \ncan take many forms. A powerful chief giving \nlivestock to a poor man may not expect goods in return, but gains social prestige \nat the debtor's expense. And among the Toraja people of Indonesia, the status gained from gift ceremonies \neven determines land ownership. The key is to keep the gift cycle going, with someone always \nindebted to someone else. Repaying a gift immediately, or with something of exactly equal value, may be read as ending \nthe social relationship. So, are gift economies exclusive \nto small-scale societies outside the industrialized world? Not quite. For one thing, even in these cultures, gift economies function alongside \na market system for other exchanges. And when we think about it, parts of our own societies \nwork in similar ways. Communal spaces, such as Burning Man, operate as a mix of barter \nand a gift economy, where selling things \nfor money is strictly taboo. In art and technology, gift economies are emerging \nas an alternative to intellectual property where artists, musicians, and open-source developers distribute their creative works, \nnot for financial profit, but to raise their social profile \nor establish their community role. And even potluck dinners \nand holiday gift traditions involve some degree \nof reciprocity and social norms. We might wonder if a gift is truly a gift if it comes with obligations \nor involves some social pay off. But this is missing the point. Our idea of a free gift \nwithout social obligations prevails only if we already think \nof everything in market terms. And in a commericalized world, the idea of strengthening bonds \nthrough giving and reciprocity may not be such a bad thing,\nwherever you may live."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the purpose of the objects traded in the Kula ring?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are used as currency to buy necessities"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are a sign of status depending on the original owner"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They can be eaten"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are used for building huts"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What differentiates a gift exchange from barter?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only items of hte same kind can be gifted"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Neither party knows what they're getting until after the fact"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It's done without haggling or waiting to see the other party's offer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only one party receives anything"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the most important element in a gift economy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Social relationships between givers and receivers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The types of objects being gifted"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The amount of the gift"}, {"label": "D", "text": "How much the gift can be sold for on the open market"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In a gift economy, how could reciprocating a gift with one of the same value be interpreted?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "'I am reliable and responsible'"}, {"label": "B", "text": "'Our business is concluded and I wish to have no further dealings'"}, {"label": "C", "text": "'I am stingy'"}, {"label": "D", "text": "'I would like a different sort of gift next time'"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What are some modern-day examples of gift economies?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Burning Man"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Potlatch feasts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The open-source movement"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

But one institution stands out for\nboth its global scale and its lasting legacy. The Atlantic slave trade, occurring from the late 15th\nto the mid 19th century and spanning three continents, forcibly brought more than 10 million Africans\nto the Americas. The impact it would leave affected\nnot only these slaves and their descendants, but the economies and histories\nof large parts of the world. There had been centuries of contact\nbetween Europe and Africa via the Mediterranean. But the Atlantic slave trade \nbegan in the late 1400s with Portuguese colonies in West Africa, and Spanish settlement \nof the Americas shortly after. The crops grown in the new colonies,\nsugar cane, tobacco, and cotton, were labor intensive, and there were not enough settlers \nor indentured servants to cultivate all the new land. American Natives were enslaved, \nbut many died from new diseases, while others effectively resisted. And so to meet the massive \ndemand for labor, the Europeans looked to Africa. African slavery had existed \nfor centuries in various forms. Some slaves were indentured servants, with a limited term \nand the chance to buy one's freedom. Others were more like European serfs. In some societies, slaves could \nbe part of a master's family, own land, and even rise \nto positions of power. But when white captains came offering \nmanufactured goods, weapons, and rum for slaves, African kings and merchants \nhad little reason to hesitate. They viewed the people they sold \nnot as fellow Africans but criminals, debtors, \nor prisoners of war from rival tribes. By selling them, kings enriched \ntheir own realms, and strengthened them \nagainst neighboring enemies. African kingdoms prospered \nfrom the slave trade, but meeting the European's massive demand\ncreated intense competition. Slavery replaced other criminal sentences, and capturing slaves \nbecame a motivation for war, rather than its result. To defend themselves from slave raids, neighboring kingdoms \nneeded European firearms, which they also bought with slaves. The slave trade had become an arms race, altering societies and economies \nacross the continent. As for the slaves themselves,\nthey faced unimaginable brutality. After being marched \nto slave forts on the coast, shaved to prevent lice, and branded, they were loaded onto ships \nbound for the Americas. About 20% of them \nwould never see land again. Most captains of the day \nwere tight packers, cramming as many men \nas possible below deck. While the lack of sanitation \ncaused many to die of disease, and others were thrown \noverboard for being sick, or as discipline, the captain's ensured their profits \nby cutting off slave's ears as proof of purchase. Some captives took matters \ninto their own hands. Many inland Africans \nhad never seen whites before, and thought them to be cannibals, constantly taking people away \nand returning for more. Afraid of being eaten, \nor just to avoid further suffering, they committed suicide \nor starved themselves, believing that in death,\ntheir souls would return home. Those who survived \nwere completley dehumanized, treated as mere cargo. Women and children were kept above deck\nand abused by the crew, while the men were made to perform dances in order to keep them exercised \nand curb rebellion. What happened to those Africans \nwho reached the New World and how the legacy of slavery \nstill affects their descendants today is fairly well known. But what is not often discussed is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade\nhad on Africa's future. Not only did the continent lose\ntens of millions of its able-bodied population, but because most of the slaves \ntaken were men, the long-term demographic \neffect was even greater. When the slave trade was finally \noutlawed in the Americas and Europe, the African kingdoms whose economies \nit had come to dominate collapsed, leaving them open \nto conquest and colonization. And the increased competition \nand influx of European weapons fueled warfare and instability \nthat continues to this day. The Atlantic slave trade also contributed\nto the development of racist ideology. Most African slavery had no deeper reason\nthan legal punishment or intertribal warfare, but the Europeans \nwho preached a universal religion, and who had long ago \noutlawed enslaving fellow Christians, needed justification for a practice so obviously at odds \nwith their ideals of equality. So they claimed that \nAfricans were biologically inferior and destined to be slaves, making great efforts \nto justify this theory. Thus, slavery in Europe and the Americas\nacquired a racial basis, making it impossible for slaves \nand their future descendants to attain equal status in society. In all of these ways, the Atlantic slave trade \nwas an injustice on a massive scale whose impact has continued \nlong after its abolition."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What crops were grown in the Americas that were labor-intensive and helped lead to the slave trade?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Corn, beans, and squash"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Carrots, beans, and peas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sugar cane, tobacco, and cotton"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Corn, tobacco, and flax"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Tribalism in Africa led to intense competition and warfare amongst tribes.

Okay, fine. So, I'm not Batman.\nI'm just a bat. But like Batman, I'm often misunderstood. People think I'm scary, \nstrange and dangerous. If they only knew my story, though,\nI'd be cheered as a hero. When people think of bats, many think of vampires \nwho want to suck their blood. But the truth is \nthat out of over 1200 bat species, only three are vampire bats. Out of these three, \nonly one prefers the blood of mammals, and even these bats mostly feed on cattle. Maybe that still doesn't seem so great, but vampire bats \ncan be a great help to humans. A chemical known as desmoteplase \nfound in vampire bat saliva helps break down blood clots, and is being tested \nby recovering stroke victims. Of the remaining 1000+ species of bats, \nabout 70% feed on insects. These bats help control \nthe real vampires: mosquitos, whose nasty bites\nare not just annoying but spread diseases, like West Nile virus. A single little brown bat \ncan eat 1000 insects every hour, and a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats \ncan eat several tons of moths in just one night. In the United States alone, bats provide an estimated \n3.7 billion dollars worth of free pest control for farmers, which benefits everyone \nwho eats the foods that they grow. Fruit bats, also called megabats \nbecause of their large size, are important for the role \nthey play in plant pollination. By traveling between flowers \nwhile feeding on nectar and fruits, these bats transport the pollen \nand seeds that help plants reproduce. In Southeast Asia, for example, the cave nectar bat is the only pollinator\nof the durian fruit. Other bats pollinate peaches, bananas, and the agave plants \nthat tequila is made from. Without them, many of our food plants would be unable \nto produce the tasty fruits we enjoy. As heroes of the ecosystem, \nbats have their own unique utility belts. Bats have been a source of inspiration \nfor the design of flying robots and even an energy-efficient spy plane, as they are the only mammal \ncapable of true powered flight. Echolocation, a type of biological sonar,\nis also used by bats as a way to navigate and find prey in the dark. Although there's a common \nmisconception that bats are blind, in truth, all species of bats have sight. And some have even adapted \nlarge eyes to see better in dim lighting. Many people worry \nabout getting infected by bats, and like any other animals,\nbats can carry diseases, like rabies. In reality, though, less than .5% of all bats\ncarry this virus. That's about the same odds as getting \nthe same result on a coin flip eight times in a row. The perception that bats \nare often diseased may come from the fact that sick bats, who may show unusual behavior, \nemerge during the daytime, or be unable to fly, are more likely to be \nencountered by people. So a good way to protect yourself \nis to protect bats as well, keeping them healthy,\nprotecting their habitats, and reducing their risk \nof transmitting disease. In North America, bats are threatened \nby a devastating sickness called white-nose syndrome. This fungal infection \ncauses bats to wake up while hibernating during a winter. Unable to find food, \nthey expend large amounts of energy, and eventually starve to death. White-nose syndrome has wiped out\nentire caves full of bats, with a mortality rate that can exceed 90%. Climate change and habitat destruction also pose serious threats \nto bat populations. For example, in January 2014,\na record heat wave in Australia caused over 100,000 bats \nto die from heat exhaustion. Some people just want \nto watch the world burn, and bats all over the world are threatened\nby damage to the places that we call home, including mangrove swamps, old-growth forests, and, of course, bat caves. So even though I'm the hero of the story,\nI do need to be saved. And now that you know \nthe true story about us bats, you can learn how to protect \nsuch heroic animals. Install a properly designed bat box, one of the easiest ways \nto provide shelter for bats. Discourage the use of pesticides,\nwhich can harm bats when we try to feed on the insects \nyou want to get rid of in the first place. Avoid going into caves \nwhere you might disturb hibernating bats, and always decontaminate \nyour gear after visiting a cave. If you have unwanted bats \nliving in an attic or barn, contact your local government \nto safely and humanely relocate us. And if you come across a bat, \ndo not attempt to handle it, but instead, call Animal Control. Batman might want to keep \nhis identity secret, but a great way to help real bats\nis by continuing to learn about them and spreading the truth \nthat they are real heroes, even if their good deeds are often unseen."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many species of bats are true vampires?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "None"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30"}, {"label": "D", "text": "300"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of these is a way that bats have helped humans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Eating insects like mosquitoes and crop pests"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pollinating plants and dispersing seeds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Inspiring design for robotic airplanes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of these statements is true?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All bats are blind"}, {"label": "B", "text": "All bats carry rabies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bats are the only mammal that can fly"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Bats are the only mammal that can echolocate"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "White nose syndrome is a disease caused by a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Virus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bacteria"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fungus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Insect"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these is a good way to help bats?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Install a bat box"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Avoid using pesticides"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Teach others about why bats are important"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 47, "lesson": 16, "title": "At what moment are you dead? - Randall Hayes", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/at-what-moment-are-you-dead-randall-hayes", "transcript": {"en": "For as far back\nas we can trace our existence, humans have been fascinated \nwith death and resurrection. Nearly every religion in the world \nhas some interpretation of them, and from our earliest myths to the latest cinematic blockbusters,\nthe dead keep coming back. But is resurrection really possible? And what is the actual difference between \na living creature and a dead body, anyway? To understand what death is, \nwe need to understand what life is. One ancient theory \nwas an idea called vitalism, which claimed \nthat living things were unique because they were filled \nwith a special substance, or energy, that was the essence of life. Whether it was called qi, lifeblood, or humors, the belief in such an essence \nwas common throughout the world, and still persists \nin the stories of creatures who can somehow drain life from others, or some form of magical sources \nthat can replenish it. Vitalism began to fade \nin the Western world following the Scientific Revolution \nin the 17th century. René Descartes advanced the notion that the human body was essentially \nno different from any other machine, brought to life by a divinely created soul\nlocated in the brain's pineal gland. And in 1907, Dr. Duncan McDougall \neven claimed that the soul had mass, weighing patients immediately\nbefore and after death in an attempt to prove it. Though his experiments were discredited,\nmuch like the rest of vitalism, traces of his theory \nstill come up in popular culture. But where do all these discredited \ntheories leave us? What we now know is \nthat life is not contained in some magical substance or spark, but within the ongoing \nbiological processes themselves. And to understand these processes, we need to zoom down \nto the level of our individual cells. Inside each of these cells, chemical reactions \nare constantly occurring, powered by the glucose and oxygen\nthat our bodies convert into the energy-carrying molecule\nknown as ATP. Cells use this energy\nfor everything from repair to growth to reproduction. Not only does it take a lot of energy \nto make the necessary molecules, but it takes even more \nto get them where they need to be. The universal phenomenon of entropy means that molecules will tend \ntowards diffusing randomly, moving from areas \nof high concentration to low concentration, or even breaking apart \ninto smaller molecules and atoms. So cells must constantly keep \nentropy in check by using energy to maintain \ntheir molecules in the very complicated formations necessary for biological functions\nto occur. The breaking down of these arrangements \nwhen the entire cell succumbs to entropy is what eventually results in death. This is the reason organisms \ncan't be simply sparked back to life once they've already died. We can pump air into someone's lungs, but it won't do much good if the many other processes\ninvolved in the respiratory cycle are no longer functioning. Similarly, the electric shock\nfrom a defibrillator doesn't jump-start an inanimate heart, but resynchronizes the muscle cells \nin an abnormally beating heart so they regain their normal rhythm. This can prevent a person from dying, \nbut it won't raise a dead body, or a monster sewn together \nfrom dead bodies. So it would seem \nthat all our various medical miracles can delay or prevent death\nbut not reverse it. But that's not as simple as it sounds because constant advancements \nin technology and medicine have resulted in diagnoses such as coma, describing potentially \nreversible conditions, under which people would have previously \nbeen considered dead. In the future, the point of no return \nmay be pushed even further. Some animals are known \nto extend their lifespans or survive extreme conditions by slowing down their biological processes to the point where \nthey are virtually paused. And research into cryonics \nhopes to achieve the same by freezing dying people \nand reviving them later when newer technology \nis able to help them. See, if the cells are frozen, \nthere's very little molecular movement, and diffusion practically stops. Even if all of a person's cellular \nprocesses had already broken down, this could still conceivably be reversed \nby a swarm of nanobots, moving all the molecules \nback to their proper positions, and injecting all of the cells \nwith ATP at the same time, presumably causing the body \nto simply pick up where it left off. So if we think of life \nnot as some magical spark, but a state of incredibly complex,\nself-perpetuating organization, death is just \nthe process of increasing entropy that destroys this fragile balance.

Trace back \nthe battery chargers and power cords and you'll end up at an electrical outlet, providing easy, safe access \nto reliable electricity. But beyond that outlet, \nthe picture gets messier. It takes a lot of fuel to heat our homes, preserve our food, and our power our gadgets \naround the clock. And for 40% of the world, \nthat fuel is cheap, plentiful, and it's called coal. But coal also releases \npollutants into the air, like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, soot, and toxic metals, like mercury. These cause environmental damage,\nlike acid rain, and serious health problems. In fact, in 1952, coal burning \ncaused such heavy smog in London that pedestrians \ncouldn't even see their feet, and thousands of people died\nfrom ill health. Since then, many countries \nhave deployed technology to remove most of these pollutants \nbefore they reach the air. But now we have a new \nair pollution problem on our hands, one that doesn't show up \nin a cloud of dark smog, but in rising seas, floods, and heat waves. It's global climate change, and again, the main culprit is coal. It's responsible for 44%\nof global carbon dioxide emissions, which trap the sun's heat \nin the Earth's atmosphere, instead of letting it escape. So now the question is \nhow do we remove that bad stuff as well? That's the idea behind cleaner coal. Creating cleaner coal is really about \ntrying to contain its ill effects with the help of special technologies\nthat make the end product more acceptable. Just like the most intriguing superheroes often have their own dark powers \nto overcome, so we can try and keep \ncoal's negative forces in check. But why don't we just exterminate coal if it takes that much effort\nto clean it up? Simply, coal is extremely valuable to us,\nand it's easy to come by. Compressed underground for ages, coal holds chemical energy from plants that were fed from by the sun \nhundreds of millions of years ago, long before humans evolved. That makes coal energy dense, \nmeaning it can be burned 'round the clock. It's also cheap, \nif you ignore the pollution costs, and should last us \nthrough the end of the 21st century. We've already got all the infrastructure \nin place for harnessing its power, and globally, although countries are making a move towards energy from\ncleaner and more renewable sources, there's no sign yet \nthat coal use is slowing down. In fact, as of 2012, over 1000 new coal plants \nhave been proposed, mostly in China and India. Since for the time being \ncoal is here to stay, experts say that if we want to reduce \nits emissions' impact on the atmosphere, and slow down climate change, we'll have to think of creative ways \nof reducing coal's destructive power. To do that, we need \nto strip it of its foul forces, all that toxic carbon dioxide \nthat causes havoc in the atmosphere. Then, we need to store \nthe CO2 somewhere else. This mission is called \ncarbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. And as if carbon dioxide were some \nevil genie we didn't want to escape, once it has been separated from coal, we've devised ways \nto banish it underground. We can do this by injecting it \ndeep into the Earth, or by placing it deep \nunder the ocean's surface. Stripping away coal's negative elements\ncan happen in three ways. First, and most commonly, as coal burns, the exhaust gas can be mixed \nwith a compound called monoethanolamine. Like a forceful power-stripping magnet,\nthis compound bonds to the CO2, yanking it out of the gas stream so it can be stored \nseparately underground. Another method is \nto relieve coal of its CO2 before it even has a chance \nto be released as exhaust. In this process, steam and oxygen \nswoop in to the rescue to convert coal into a special \nproduct called syngas, made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen\nand some CO2. Zap that with some water vapor, and the carbon monoxide \ngets converted into carbon dioxide, which can be isolated. The leftover hydrogen gas is then\nused as energy to generate electricity, so there's an added bonus. A third technique \nexposes coal to pure oxygen, instead of burning it in air. This creates exhaust gas with higher \nconcentrations of carbon dioxide, which makes it easy to isolate \nand to banish to the chasms below. All this can reduce emissions \nat a power plant by up to 90%, but as with any superhero \nstruggling with their destructive powers, it takes a lot of effort \nto switch over from the dark side. So these positive \npollution-busting forces, although they're available, have barely been used \nin commercial power plants because they cost a lot. But ultimately, the bigger problem \nis that in most parts of the world, it's still too easy and much cheaper \nto keep emitting carbon dioxide, and that makes it tempting \nto completely ignore coal's dark side. In this case, the most powerful \nforce for good is regulation, the rules that can restrict \nthe amount of carbon dioxide emitted from power plants, and make energy companies \naround the world wary of what they put into the air. Until then, every time you turn on a screen \nor flick a light switch, coal is lurking in the background, carrying its dark powers with it \nwherever it goes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why do we still use coal?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It's easy to find"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It's a safe fuel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It's abundant, cheap, and efficient"}, {"label": "D", "text": "We've run out of other sources of fuel"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these is a pollutant that coal emits when we burn it?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Acid"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Oxygen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Carbon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Carbon dioxide"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "_____ could be a way of making coal cleaner", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Carbon capture and sequestration"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Burying carbon dioxide under the sea"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Burning less of it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Inventing a new kind of power plant"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Clean coal technologies aren't very widespread because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They cost a lot when compared with coal, which is cheaper"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The facilities don't exist"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The technologies haven't been properly tested yet"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The public doesn't believe these technologies will work"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "True or false: our use of coal is currently declining", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Although they are separated \nover 2,400 years of history, each of them contributed \nto answering the eternal question: what is stuff made of? It was around 440 BCE \nthat Democritus first proposed that everything in the world \nwas made up of tiny particles surrounded by empty space. And he even speculated \nthat they vary in size and shape depending on the substance they compose. He called these particles \"atomos,\"\nGreek for indivisible. His ideas were opposed by\nthe more popular philosophers of his day. Aristotle, for instance, disagreed completely, stating instead that matter \nwas made of four elements: earth, wind, water and fire, and most later scientists followed suit. Atoms would remain \nall but forgotten until 1808, when a Quaker teacher named John Dalton \nsought to challenge Aristotelian theory. Whereas Democritus's atomism\nhad been purely theoretical, Dalton showed that common substances\nalways broke down into the same elements in the same proportions. He concluded that the various compounds were combinations of atoms \nof different elements, each of a particular size and mass that could neither be created \nnor destroyed. Though he received \nmany honors for his work, as a Quaker, Dalton lived modestly \nuntil the end of his days. Atomic theory was now accepted \nby the scientific community, but the next major advancement would not come \nuntil nearly a century later with the physicist J.J. Thompson's \n1897 discovery of the electron. In what we might call \nthe chocolate chip cookie model of the atom, he showed atoms as \nuniformly packed spheres of positive matter filled with negatively charged electrons. Thompson won a Nobel Prize in 1906 \nfor his electron discovery, but his model of the atom \ndidn't stick around long. This was because he happened \nto have some pretty smart students, including a certain Ernest Rutherford, who would become known \nas the father of the nuclear age. While studying the effects \nof X-rays on gases, Rutherford decided \nto investigate atoms more closely by shooting small, positively charged \nalpha particles at a sheet of gold foil. Under Thompson's model, the atom's thinly dispersed \npositive charge would not be enough \nto deflect the particles in any one place. The effect would have been \nlike a bunch of tennis balls punching through a thin paper screen. But while most of the particles \ndid pass through, some bounced right back, suggesting that the foil was more \nlike a thick net with a very large mesh. Rutherford concluded that atoms \nconsisted largely of empty space with just a few electrons, while most of the mass \nwas concentrated in the center, which he termed the nucleus. The alpha particles \npassed through the gaps but bounced back from the dense, \npositively charged nucleus. But the atomic theory \nwasn't complete just yet. In 1913, another of Thompson's students \nby the name of Niels Bohr expanded on Rutherford's nuclear model. Drawing on earlier work \nby Max Planck and Albert Einstein he stipulated that electrons \norbit the nucleus at fixed energies and distances, able to jump from one level to another,\nbut not to exist in the space between. Bohr's planetary model took center stage, but soon, it too encountered \nsome complications. Experiments had shown that rather than \nsimply being discrete particles, electrons simultaneously \nbehaved like waves, not being confined \nto a particular point in space. And in formulating \nhis famous uncertainty principle, Werner Heisenberg showed \nit was impossible to determine both the exact \nposition and speed of electrons as they moved around an atom. The idea that electrons \ncannot be pinpointed but exist within \na range of possible locations gave rise to the current \nquantum model of the atom, a fascinating theory \nwith a whole new set of complexities whose implications \nhave yet to be fully grasped. Even though our understanding \nof atoms keeps changing, the basic fact of atoms remains, so let's celebrate \nthe triumph of atomic theory with some fireworks. As electrons circling an atom \nshift between energy levels, they absorb or release energy in the form\nof specific wavelengths of light, resulting in \nall the marvelous colors we see.

Medical researchers suspected the deadly Marburg virus \nto be the culprit. But what they saw in microscope images\nwas an entirely new pathogen, which would be named\nafter the nearby Ebola river. Like yellow fever or dengue, the disease caused by the Ebola virus\nis a severe type of hemorrhagic fever. It begins by attacking \nthe immune system's cells and neutralizing its responses, allowing the virus to proliferate. Starting anywhere from two to twenty days\nafter contraction, initial symptoms like high temperature, aching, and sore throat resemble those of a typical flu, but quickly escalate to vomiting, rashes, and diarrhea. And as the virus spreads, it invades the lymph nodes \nand vital organs, such as kidneys and liver,\ncausing them to lose function. But the virus itself \nis not what kills Ebola victims. Instead, the mounting cell deaths \ntrigger an immune system overload, known as a cytokine storm, an explosion of immune responses\nthat damages blood vessels, causing both internal and external bleeding. The excessive fluid loss \nand resulting complications can be fatal within six to sixteen days\nof the first symptoms, though proper care and rehydration therapy can significantly reduce \nmortality rates in patients. Fortunately, \nwhile Ebola is highly virulent, several factors limit its contagiousness. Unlike viruses that proliferate through\nsmall, airborne particles, Ebola only exists in bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood, mucus, vomit, or feces. In order to spread, these must be transmitted from \nan infected person into another's body through passageways such as the eyes,\nmouth, or nose. And because the disease's severity increases directly along \nwith the viral load, even an infected person \nis unlikely to be contagious until they have begun to show symptoms. While Ebola has been shown \nto survive on surfaces for several hours, and transmission through sneezing\nor coughing is theoretically possible, virtually all known cases of contraction\nhave been through direct contact with the severely ill, with the greatest risk \nposed to medical workers and friends or relatives of the victims. This is why,\ndespite its horrifying effects, Ebola has been far less deadly overall\nthan more common infections, such as measles, malaria, or even influenza. Once an outbreak has been contained, the virus does not exist \nin the human population until the next outbreak begins. But while this is undoubtedly a good thing, it also makes Ebola difficult to study. Scientists believe fruit bats \nto be its natural carriers, but just how it is transmitted to humans\nremains unknown. Furthermore, many of the countries \nwhere Ebola outbreaks occur suffer from poor infrastructure and sanitation, which enables the disease to spread. And the poverty of these regions, combined with the relatively low amount\nof overall cases means there is little economic incentive\nfor drug companies to invest in research. Though some experimental medicines\nhave shown promise, and governments are funding development\nof a vaccine, as of 2014, the only widespread and effective \nsolutions to an Ebola outbreak remain isolation, sanitation, and information."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What animals are thought to be the natural carriers of the Ebola virus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Monkeys"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fruit bats"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Elephants"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rats"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What do Ebola victims usually die from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Loss of vital organs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Opportunistic infections"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bleeding from immune system overload"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Brain hemorrhage"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the best treatment currently available for the Ebola virus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Supportive care and rehydration therapy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Preventative Ebola vaccine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Amputation of infected areas"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Leeches"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Where does the Ebola virus get its name?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The doctor who discovered it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The river in the area where the first outbreak occurred"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The first victim to die from it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Word for 'death' in the local language"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which diseases kill more people than Ebola?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Influenza"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Measles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Malaria"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

But behind that educational exterior, which only includes \nabout 1% of a museum's collection, there are hidden laboratories \nwhere scientific breakthroughs are made. Beyond the unmarked doors, and on the floors \nthe elevators won't take you to, you'd find windows into amazing worlds. This maze of halls and laboratories \nis a scientific sanctuary that houses a seemingly \nendless variety of specimens. Here, researchers work to unravel \nmysteries of evolution, cosmic origins, and the history of our planet. One museum alone \nmay have millions of specimens. The American Museum of Natural History\nin New York City has over 32,000,000 in its collection. Let's take a look at just one of them. Scientists have logged exactly\nwhere and when it was found and used various dating techniques \nto pinpoint when it originated. Repeat that a million times over,\nand these plants, animals, minerals, fossils, and artifacts present windows \ninto times and places around the world and across billions of years of history. When a research problem emerges, scientists peer through these windows\nand test hypotheses about the past. For example, in the 1950s, \npopulations of predatory birds, like peregrine falcons, owls, and eagles started to mysteriously crash, to the point where a number of species,\nincluding the bald eagle, were declared endangered. Fortunately, scientists in \nThe Field Museum in Chicago had been collecting the eggs \nof these predatory birds for decades. They discovered that the egg shells \nused to be thicker and had started to thin around the time when an insecticide called DDT \nstarted being sprayed on crops. DDT worked very well to kill insects, but when birds came and ate\nthose heaps of dead bugs, the DDT accumulated in their bodies. It worked its way up the food chain and was absorbed by apex predator birds\nin such high concentrations that it thinned their eggs so that they couldn't support \nthe nesting bird's weight. There were omelettes everywhere until scientists from \nThe Field Museum in Chicago, and other institutions, helped solve the mystery and save the day. America thanks you, Field Museum. Natural history museums \nwindows into the past have solved many other \nscientific mysteries. Museum scientists have used \ntheir collections to sequence the Neanderthal genome, discover genes that gave mammoths red fur, and even pinpoint where \nancient giant sharks gave birth. There are about 900 \nnatural history museums in the world, and every year they make \nnew discoveries and insights into the Earth's past, present and future. Museum collections even help us \nunderstand how modern threats, such as global climate change, are impacting our world. For instance, \nnaturalists have been collecting samples for over 100 years from Walden Pond, famously immortalized \nby Henry David Thoreau. Thanks to those naturalists,\nwho count Thoreau among their number, we know that the plants around Walden Pond are blooming over three weeks earlier \nthan they did 150 years ago. Because these changes \nhave taken place gradually, one person may not have noticed them\nover the span of a few decades, but thanks to museum collections, we have an uninterrupted record \nshowing how our world is changing. So the next time you're exploring \na natural history museum, remember that what you're seeing \nis just one gem of a colossal scientific treasure trove.

It may look like a tiny worm\nor a transparent blob, and whenever you try to get\na closer look, it disappears, only to reappear\nas soon as you shift your glance. But don't go rinsing out your eyes! What you are seeing is a common phenomenon known as a floater. The scientific name for these objects\nis Muscae volitantes, Latin for \"flying flies,\" and true to their name,\nthey can be somewhat annoying. But they're not actually bugs\nor any kind of external objects at all. Rather, they exist inside your eyeball. Floaters may seem to be alive,\nsince they move and change shape, but they are not alive. Floaters are tiny objects\nthat cast shadows on the retina, the light-sensitive tissue\nat the back of your eye. They might be bits of tissue, red blood cells, or clumps of protein. And because they're suspended\nwithin the vitreous humor, the gel-like liquid\nthat fills the inside of your eye, floaters drift along\nwith your eye movements, and seem to bounce a little\nwhen your eye stops. Floaters may be only\nbarely distinguishable most of the time. They become more visible\nthe closer they are to the retina, just as holding your hand closer\nto a table with an overhead light will result in a more\nsharply defined shadow. And floaters are particularly noticeable when you are looking\nat a uniform bright surface, like a blank computer screen, snow, or a clear sky, where the consistency of the background\nmakes them easier to distinguish. The brighter the light is,\nthe more your pupil contracts. This has an effect similar\nto replacing a large diffuse light fixture with a single overhead light bulb, which also makes\nthe shadow appear clearer. There is another visual phenomenon\nthat looks similar to floaters but is in fact unrelated. If you've seen tiny dots of light\ndarting about when looking at a bright blue sky, you've experienced what is known\nas the blue field entoptic phenomenon. In some ways,\nthis is the opposite of seeing floaters. Here, you are not seeing shadows but little moving windows\nletting light through to your retina. The windows are actually caused\nby white blood cells moving through the capillaries\nalong your retina's surface. These leukocytes can be so large\nthat they nearly fill a capillary causing a plasma space\nto open up in front of them. Because the space\nand the white blood cells are both more transparent to blue light than the red blood cells\nnormally present in capillaries, we see a moving dot of light\nwherever this happens, following the paths of your capillaries\nand moving in time with your pulse. Under ideal viewing conditions, you might even see what looks\nlike a dark tail following the dot. This is the red blood cells\nthat have bunched up behind the leukocyte. Some science museums have an exhibit\nwhich consists of a screen of blue light, allowing you to see these blue sky sprites\nmuch more clearly than you normally would. While everybody's eyes experience\nthese sort of effects, the number and type vary greatly. In the case of floaters, they often go unnoticed,\nas our brain learns to ignore them.

This is your liver,\nthe heaviest organ in your body, and one of the most crucial. This industrious structure \nsimultaneously acts as a storehouse, a manufacturing hub, and a processing plant. And each of these functions involve \nso many important subtasks that without the liver, \nour bodies would simply stop working. One of the liver's main functions \nis to filter the body's blood, which it receives in regular shipments \nfrom two sources: the hepatic artery \ndelivers blood from the heart, while the hepatic portal vein \nbrings it from the intestine. This double delivery \nfills the liver with nutrients, that it then sorts, processes and stores with the help of thousands \nof tiny internal processing plants, known as lobules. Both blood flows also deliver the oxygen \nthat the liver needs to function. The blood that is received \nfrom the intestine contains carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins and other nutrients \ndissolved in it from the food you've consumed. These must be processed in different ways. In the case of carbohydrates, the liver breaks them down \nand converts them into sugars for the body to use as energy \nwhen the filtered blood is sent back out. Sometimes the body \nhas leftovers of nutrients that it doesn't immediately require. When that happens, \nthe liver holds some back, and stacks them in its storage facility. This facility works like a pantry for future cases when the body \nmight be in need of nutrients. But the blood flowing into the liver\nisn't always full of good things. It also contains toxins\nand byproducts that the body can't use. And the liver monitors these strictly. When it spots\na useless or toxic substance, it either converts it into a product \nthat can't hurt the body or isolates it and whisks it away, channeling it through \nthe kidneys and intestine to be excreted. Of course, we wouldn't consider \nthe liver a factory if it didn't also manufacture things. This organ makes everything \nfrom various blood plasma proteins that transport fatty acids \nand help form blood clots, to the cholesterol \nthat helps the body create hormones. It also makes vitamin D\nand substances that help digestion. But one of its most vital products \nis bile. Like an eco-friendly treatment plant, the liver uses cells called hepatocytes to convert toxic waste products \ninto this bitter greenish liquid. As it's produced, bile is funneled \ninto a small container below the liver, called the gallbladder, before being trickled into the intestine to help break down fats, destroy microbes,\nand neutralize extra stomach acid. Bile also helps carry other toxins \nand byproducts from the liver out of the body. So as you can see, the liver is an extremely efficient \nindustrial site, performing multiple tasks \nthat support each other. But such a complex system \nneeds to be kept running smoothly by keeping it healthy and not overloading it \nwith more toxins than it can handle. This is one factory \nwe simply can't afford to shut down."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The liver receives blood from:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The lobules"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The stomach and the gall bladder"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Veins and arteries"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The hepatic artery and the hepatic portal vein"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "An important function of the liver is to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Store the body's blood"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Redirect the blood to other parts of the body"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Filter the body's blood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Make sure the body has enough blood"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Inside the liver, the ______ help the organ to process and store nutrients", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lobules"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hepatic cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Liver cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Bile fluids"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When the liver encounters more nutrients than the body needs, it:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dissolves them"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sends them to the kidneys"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stores them for later"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Converts them into something else"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is in the blood when it enters the liver?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Just toxins"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Only sugars and fats"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Some oxygen but little else"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Carbohydrates, vitamins, fats, and a range of other nutrients"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Could we detect it ahead of time?  And more\nimportantly could we stop it? I believe I have an answer, now you see, asteroid\nimpacts are serious business, when I was in second\ngrade Ms. McGonigal told us that the dinosaurs the ancient dinosaurs\ndied out because they had small brains may be like my old boss.  But even she knew that was\nkinda lamethat theory was nothing. It turns out in my lifetime people found\nthis crater, off Chicxulub mexico.  This crator was so\nbig, how big was it, it was so big that an asteroid hit the earth (or impactors hit the earth). Threw so much stuff into the\nEarth's sky it was bigger in diameter than the earth itself so the earth was\nsurrounded by red hot rock for weeks at a time, it cooked everything.  And just the\nanimals that lived in burrows and caves, our ancestors lead to us so serious\nbusiness you may recall Valentine's Day 2013? Chelyabinsk Russia (boom) air burst. See if you are an asteroid, and you are going 10 km /s or 20 km /s   And you hit the Earth's atmosphere, the atmosphere is like concrete. you can't get out of the way so the\nasteroid just explodes in air burst. So these asteroids are serious, most of\nthem are very small.  If you're under 10 meters in\ndiameter you hit the Earth's atmosphere you burn up all Big Blue streak, green street white streak and then humans make wishes\nupon you. (I don't know house efficacious those\nwishes are but people do that), alright so, if ther asteroid starts to get bigger, starts to\nget into the twenty-five meters and the 45 meters in diameter then you get\nMeteor Crater Arizona (wham) huge thing. That would be like a city killer, or a county killer. And then when they get to be a 100 meters / 140 meters now you're into a country killer, and then they get bigger than that and it's a\ncontinent killer, much bigger than that and you're taking out whole races of ancient species. So, what if we found an asteroid that\nwas headed our way, how would we find it? How would we find an asteroid headed our\nway?  That's a good question, well you can use telescopes.  Skilled people\ncan point the cameras at the sky and look for fast-moving objects. Objects that are crossing the Earth's\norbit, but we're missing perhaps a hundred thousand of these things, of these county\nkillers, city killers and country killers. So, what we want to do is build a\nspacecraft called The Sentinel, and as we say \"it's like looking for a\ncharcoal briquette in the dark\", these things are hard to\nfind.  They are tiny compared to the vastness of space. But infrared light / heat bounces off them\nso what you will do - you are a satellite, you are a surveying\nspacecraft, you get your back to the Sun and look\nout from about the orbit of Venus.  And try to\nfind all these asteroids.  And then you find one, what\ndo you do? Do you run in circles screaming? \"AH\" No, No No, we've got to deflect it, just a little, just a tiny amount.\nAsteroid might be going 10 km/s we want to change its speed about 2 mm/s. So ten kilometers, that's ten times a\nthousand meters, that's 10,000 meters. A millimeter that's a thousandth of a meter so that you take the one over\nthe thousand its a thousand times ten thousand, that's 10 million. You want to change its\nspeed a 10 millionth of its total.  That's not very much, but if you're an asteroid that comes in at 10,000 tons / 100,000 tonnes, it does take quite a bit force to\nchange it a 10 millionth of its speed. Okay, how do we do that? Well, the easiest way is to get a rocket, just a big rocket, just go out there and smack into it. Except as an outer\nspace so it just goes (silence) like that.  Okay, that would change its\nspeed a little, now notice everybody, what if it's not just a rock?  What if its\na pile of rocks just loosely held together by primordial\ngravity? And so if you hit them they will just spread out and you will have a shower of rocks. That would be bad.  So, how about\nthis? We will get a big space craft that is massive,  a massive spacecraft will go out there and just get nearer to the asteroid. Just get near it, and then the mutual\ngravity of the you the asteroid and me the spacecraft will tug the asteroids just a\nlittle bit just a tiny amounth or maybe get on the other side and tug   this way.  That might work but here's\nthe problem. We need a huge amount of fuel, for days and weeks and months and years. And what if it stops working, you can't\ngo out there and fix it. Okay, how about this? The Laser Bees? A swarm of sunlight powered lasers, that are zapping the surface of the\nasteroid, for days, and weeks, and months,and years ZAP ZAP ZAP, so some asteroids, some rock is\nvaporized so the ejecta, or the stuff ejected has\nmomentum just like rocket fuel, just like just\nlike standing on a skateboard and playing catch with a bowling ball... the way you do.  And so it would then cause the asteroid to change its speed.  And\nso you send a swarm of these laser spacecraft, so that if one of them stops working\nyou can use the other one.  And you can have them come in from all\ndifferent angles.  And what if the asteroid is irregularly shaped (like this) you could beam it when the thing is\nsmooth and then when there's a pit or an\ninefficient place to be beaming you turn off, you wait for the asteroid to turn,\nthen you turn it back on. You see everybody, just because it's unlikely, doesn't mean\nit's not a big deal. You know if it only happens once every\nfew thousand years, well if it happens on my watch it would as the kids say \"suck\".  Okay, so we\ndon't want that to happen, we want to avoid that. Asteroids are serious business, but\nthey're exciting. (Spaceship noise) Except we are in space so its (silence). Got a burning question?  Well be sure to\nsubscribe asapscience, follow us on Twitter and Facebook, that's what all\nthe kids are doing. And if it's an asteroid it may not be a burning\nquestion, it might be an impacting question, or even and ablating question."}, "multiple-choice": []}

If the tumor is not removed, cancer has the ability to \nspread to nearby organs, as well as places far away\nfrom the origin, such as the brain. So how does cancer move to new areas, and why are some organs more likely\nto get infected than others? The process of cancer spreading across the\nbody is known as metastasis. It begins when cancer cells from an initial\ntumor invade nearby normal tissue. As the cells proliferate, they spread via one of the three \ncommon routes of metastasis: transcoelomic, lymphatic, \nor hematogenous spread. In transcoelomic spread, malignant cells\npenetrate the covering surfaces of cavities in our body. These surfaces are known as \nperitoneum and serve as walls to segment \nthe body cavity. Malignant cells in ovarian cancer, \nfor example, spread through peritoneum, \nwhich connects the ovary to the liver, resulting in metastasis on \nthe liver surface. Next, cancerous cells invade blood vessels\nwhen they undergo hematogenous spread. As there are blood vessels almost \neverywhere in the body, malignant cells utilize this to reach\nmore distant parts of the body. Finally, lymphatic spread occurs\nwhen the cancer invades the lymph nodes, and travels to other parts of the body\nvia the lymphatic system. As this system drains many\nparts of the body, it also provides a large network\nfor the cancer. In addition, the lymphatic vessels empty\ninto the blood circulation, allowing the malignant cells to undergo\nhematogenous spread. Once at a new site, the cells once again\nundergo proliferation, and form small tumors known as\nmicrometastases. These small tumors then grow \ninto full-fledged tumors, and complete the metastatic process. Different cancers have been known to have\nspecific sites of metastasis. For example, prostate cancer commonly\nmetastasizes to the bone, while colon cancer metastasizes \nto the liver. Various theories have been proposed to\nexplain the migration pattern of malignant cells. Of particular interest are \ntwo conflicting theories. Stephen Paget, an English surgeon, came up with the seed and soil\ntheory of metastasis. The seed and soil theory stated that\ncancer cells die easily in the wrong microenvironment, hence they only metastasize to a location\nwith similar characteristics. However, James Ewing, the first professor\nof pathology at Cornell University, challenged the seed and soil theory, and proposed that the site of metastasis\nwas determined by the location of the vascular and lymphatic channels\nwhich drain the primary tumor. Patients with primary tumors that were\ndrained by vessels leading to the lung would eventually develop lung metastases. Today, we know that both theories contain\nvaluable truths. Yet the full stories of metastasis is much\nmore complicated than either of the two proposed theories. Factors like the cancer cell's properties, and the effectiveness of the immune system\nin eliminating the cancer cells, also play a role in determining\nthe success of metastasis. Unfortunately, many questions about \nmetastasis remain unanswered until today. Understanding the exact mechanism holds\nan important key to finding a cure for\nadvanced stage cancers. By studying both the genetic and\nenvironmental factors, which contribute to successful metastasis, we can pinpoint ways to shut down\nthe process. The war against cancer is \na constant struggle, and scientists are hard at work developing\nnew methods against metastasis. Of recent interest is immunotherapy, a modality which involves harnessing the\npower of the immune system to destroy the migrating cells. This can be done in different ways, such as training immune cells to recognize\ncancerous cells via vaccines. The growth and activity\nof the immune cells can also be stimulated by injecting\nman-made interleukins, chemicals which are usually secreted by\nthe immune cells of the body. These two treatments are only the\ntip of the iceberg. With the collaborated research efforts of \ngovernments, companies and scientists, perhaps the process of metastasis will\nbe stopped for good."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is not a route where cancer cells can metastasize?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Transcoelomic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lymphatic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Transdermal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Haematogenous"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In which of these mechanisms of spread can the cancer cell also metastasize to the blood?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Transcoelomic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lymphatic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Transdermal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Respiratory"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Stephen Paget, an English neurosurgeon, was famous for which of the theories for metastasis?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Seed and soil theory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Seed and plant theory"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Soil and plant theory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Anatomical drainage theory"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following theories explains metastasis completely?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Seed and soil theory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Anatomical drainage theory"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Neither A nor B"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both A and B.
