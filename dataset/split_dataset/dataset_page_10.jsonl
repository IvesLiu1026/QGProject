He recorded techniques nearly as old \nas Indian civilization itself in 196 manuals called the Yoga Sutras. These texts defined yoga as the ‘yoking’ \nor restraining of the mind from focusing on external objects in efforts to reach a state \nof pure consciousness. Over time, yoga came to incorporate\nphysical elements from gymnastics and wrestling. Today, there are a multitude of approaches\nto modern yoga— though most still maintain the three core\nelements of Patañjali’s practice: physical postures, breathing exercises, \nand spiritual contemplation. This blend of physical \nand mental exercise is widely believed to have a unique set \nof health advantages. Such as improving strength\nand flexibility, boosting heart and lung function, \nand enhancing psychological well-being. But what have contemporary studies shown\nregarding the benefits of this ancient tradition? Despite attempts by many researchers, it's tough to make specific claims \nabout yoga's advantages. Its unique combination of activities \nmakes it difficult to determine which component is producing \na specific health benefit. Additionally, yoga studies are often \nmade up of small sample sizes that lack diversity, and the heavy reliance on self-reporting\nmakes results subjective. However, there are some health benefits that have more robust scientific \nsupport than others. Let’s start with flexibility and strength. Twisting your body \ninto yoga’s physical postures stretches multiple muscle groups. In the short term, stretching can change\nthe water content of these muscles, ligaments, and tendons \nto make them more elastic. Over time, regular stretching \nstimulates stem cells which then differentiate \ninto new muscle tissue and other cells that generate \nelastic collagen. Frequent stretching also reduces \nthe body’s natural reflex to constrict muscles, improving your pain tolerance \nfor feats of flexibility. Researchers haven’t found \nthat any one form of yoga improves flexibility more than another, so the impact of specific \npostures is unclear. But like other low-impact exercises, yoga reliably improves fitness \nand flexibility in healthy populations. The practice has also been shown to be\na potentially powerful therapeutic tool. In studies involving patients with \na variety of musculo-skeletal disorders, yoga was more helpful at reducing pain \nand improving mobility than other forms of low-impact exercise. Adding yoga to an existing \nexercise routine can improve strength and flexibility for hard to treat \nconditions like chronic lower back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Yoga’s mix of physical exercise \nand regimented breathing has proven similarly therapeutic \nfor lung health. Lung diseases like chronic bronchitis, \nemphysema, and asthma shrink the passageways that carry oxygen, while weakening the membrane \nthat brings oxygen into the blood. But breathing exercises \nlike those found in yoga relax the muscles constricting \nthose passageways and improve oxygen diffusion. Increasing the blood’s oxygen content\nis especially helpful for those with weak heart muscles who have difficulty pumping\nenough oxygen throughout the body. And for those with healthy hearts, this practice can lower blood pressure\nand reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Yoga’s most widely celebrated benefit\nmay be the most difficult to prove: its psychological effects. Despite the longstanding association \nbetween yoga and psychological wellbeing, there’s little conclusive evidence \non how the practice affects mental health. One of the biggest claims is that yoga improves symptoms \nof depression and anxiety disorders. Since diagnosis of these conditions\nvaries widely as do their origin and severity,\nit’s difficult to quantify yoga’s impact. However, there is evidence to suggest that yoga can help reduce \nthe symptoms of stress, as well as meditation or relaxation. Research on the effects \nof yoga is still evolving. In the future, we’ll need larger studies, \nincorporating diverse participants, which can measure yoga’s impact\non heart attacks, cancer rates, cognitive function and more. But for now, yoga can continue \nits ancient tradition as a way to exercise, reflect, and relax."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The origins of Yoga can be traced back to which ancient scholar?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Plato"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sushruta"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Patanjali"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Zhang Sanfen"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The core elements of traditional yogic practice include all of the following except which one?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Physical postures"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Herbal infusions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spiritual contemplation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Breathing exercises"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Research into yoga is limited by which of the following?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Small sample sizes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lack of diversity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Reliance on self-reporting"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "With regard to lung disease, yoga may have therapeutic benefits in all of the following except which one?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Chronic bronchitis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Acute pulmonary edema"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Asthma"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Emphysema"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements about yoga is NOT true?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yoga prevents certain cancers from recurring"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Its practice was originally described in texts called the Yoga Sutras"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Yoga improves strength and flexibility"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Stress reduction can be achieved through yoga"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 10, "lesson": 2, "title": "Can steroids save your life? - Anees Bahji", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-steroids-save-your-life-anees-bahji", "transcript": {"en": "Steroids: they’re infamous \nfor their use in sports. But they’re also found in inhalers, \ncreams to treat poison ivy and eczema, and shots to ease inflammation. The steroids in these medicines aren’t \nthe same as the ones used to build muscle. In fact, they’re all based on \nyet another steroid— one our body produces naturally, \nand we can’t live without. Taking a step back, the reason \nthere are so many different steroids is because the term refers to substances \nwith a shared molecular structure, rather than shared effects on the body. Steroids can be naturally occurring \nor synthetic, but what all steroids have in common \nis a molecular structure that consists of a base of four rings \nmade of 17 carbon atoms arranged in three hexagons \nand one pentagon. A molecule must contain \nthis exact arrangement to be a steroid, though most also have side chains— additional atoms that can dramatically \nimpact the molecule’s function. Steroids get their name \nfrom the fatty molecule cholesterol. In fact, our bodies make steroids \nout of cholesterol. That fatty cholesterol base \nmeans that steroids are able to cross fatty cell membranes \nand enter cells. Within the cell, they can directly \ninfluence gene expression and protein synthesis. This is different from many other types \nof signaling molecules, which can’t cross the cell membrane and have to create their effects \nfrom outside the cell, through more complicated pathways. So steroids can create their effects \nfaster than those other molecules. Back to the steroids \nin anti-inflammatory medications: all of these are based on a naturally \noccurring steroid called cortisol. Cortisol is the body’s \nprimary stress signal, and it has a huge range of functions. When we experience a stressor— anything from a fight with a friend, \nto spotting a bear, to an infection or low blood sugar— the brain reacts by sending a signal from \nthe hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland then sends a signal \nto the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands produce cortisol, \nand release some constantly. But when they receive the signal \nfrom the pituitary gland, they release a burst of cortisol, which spurs the body to generate \nmore glucose for energy, decrease functions not immediately \nrelated to survival, like digestion, and can activate \na fight-flight-or-freeze response. This is helpful in the short term, \nbut can cause undesirable side effects like insomnia and lowered mood \nif they last too long. Cortisol also interacts \nwith the immune system in complex ways— depending on the situation, it can increase or decrease \ncertain immune functions. In the process of fighting infection, the immune system \noften creates inflammation. Cortisol suppresses the immune system’s \nability to produce inflammation, which, again, \ncan be useful in the short term. But too much cortisol \ncan have negative impacts, like reducing the immune system’s ability \nto regenerate bone marrow and lymph nodes. To prevent levels \nfrom staying high for too long, cortisol suppresses the signal \nthat causes the adrenal glands to release more cortisol. Medicinal corticosteroids channel \ncortisol’s effects on the immune system to fight allergic reactions, \nrashes, and asthma. All these things are forms \nof inflammation. There are many synthetic steroids \nthat share the same basic mechanism: they enhance the body’s cortisol supply, which in turn shuts down \nthe hyperactive immune responses that cause inflammation. These corticosteroids sneak into cells \nand can turn off the “fire alarm” by suppressing gene expression \nof inflammatory signals. The steroids in inhalers and creams impact\nonly the affected organ— the skin, or the lungs. Intravenous or oral versions, used \nto treat chronic autoimmune conditions like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, \nimpact the whole body. With these conditions, the body’s \nimmune system attacks its own cells, a process analogous to a constant \nasthma attack or rash. A constant low dose of steroids can help keep this renegade\nimmune response under control— but because of the negative psychological \nand physiological effects of longterm exposure, higher doses are reserved \nfor emergencies and flare-ups. While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts, \nand irritable bowel syndrome might seem totally unrelated, \nthey all have something in common: an immune response \nthat’s doing more harm than good. And while corticosteroids \nwon’t give you giant muscles, they can be the body’s best defense \nagainst itself."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In this particular study area, up to ____ percent of a grizzly bear’s diet is vegetation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10"}, {"label": "B", "text": "70"}, {"label": "C", "text": "90"}, {"label": "D", "text": "40"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How do steroids enter the cell?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They diffuse across the cell membrane."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They bind to receptors on the surface of the cell membrane."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They engulf the cell."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Steroids don’t enter the cell."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the name of the body’s primary steroid molecule?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cortisol"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Corticone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Corticare"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cholesterol"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the primary function of cortisol?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To suppress immunity and cope with stress"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To enhance the fight/flight response at the expense of the freeze response"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To boost allergy-type reactions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To promote sleep and restoration"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What do all steroids have in common?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Structure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Function"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Source"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Indication"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the name of the body’s primary steroid molecule?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cortisol"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Corticone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Corticare"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cholesterol"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the primary function of cortisol?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To suppress immunity and cope with stress"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To enhance the fight/flight response at the expense of the freeze response"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To boost allergy-type reactions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To promote sleep and restoration"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How do steroids enter the cell?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They diffuse across the cell membrane."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They bind to receptors on the surface of the cell membrane."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They engulf the cell."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Steroids don’t enter the cell."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How do steroids exert their effects in the cell?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They bind to steroid receptors in the cell, which activates or suppresses gene expression in the nucleus."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They induce a second-messenger cascade."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They promote nerve firing in the brain and spinal cord"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Steroids do not exert their effects in the cell, but rather, bind to proteins on the surface of the cell."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Mexican salamander that scientists and the Internet alike love for their amazing ability to regenerate limbs and probably for that derpy smile hi I'm Danielle Defoe and you're watching Animal Logic axolotls are members of the ambystoma today family and are native to a very small region in Mexico axolotls were revered by Aztecs and their capital city was built on Islands and the lakes inhabited by the creatures but when the Spanish settled in 1521 they drained the lakes and built their city in its place a first step in driving axolotls towards extinction as Mexico City continues to grow and pollute the axolotl population is pushed further and further towards the brink today they can only be found in the wild in Mexico's Xochimilco link complex near Mexico City axolotls are unique among salamanders because they are Neotech which means that they reach adulthood without going through metamorphosis so they retain all of their juvenile features like us Millennials while most salamanders will grow up lose their gills in their dorsal fin as they get bigger and emerge onto land axolotls will keep their feathery external gills and remain underwater permanently it is extremely rare but sometimes axolotls will reach maturity and go through metamorphosis but even then they tend to keep to the water this has been accomplished in the lab by injecting them with a shot of iodine after which they more closely resemble their relatives the tiger salamander axolotls can get pretty big measuring around a foot or thirty centimeters long fully grown and they have long lives around 15 years in the wild but probably the most interesting thing about them is their intense ability to regenerate many amphibians do have the ability to regenerate but axolotls blow the competition out of the water not only can they perfectly and seemingly endlessly regenerate limbs but they can also regenerate their spinal cord jaw tail and skin all without scarring no matter how many times you cut off their limbs they'll grow back perfectly every single time and you wouldn't even be able to tell that you would cut off their limbs in the first place you could also even cut out a chunk of their spine come back in a month and a half and there'll be no worse for wear they are also a thousand times more resistant to cancer than any other animal it works like this after the amputation the cells at the site of the amputation lose their identity so instead of being skin cells or blood cells they become similar to stem cells called pluripotent cells and they're able to make any cell or tissue that the body would need to repair itself in this case they use the pleura in cells to generate all the cells and tissues needed to create new perfect limbs this phenomenon is a favorite among the scientific community for its potential to help burn victims amputees and even cancer victims scientists have experimented with modifying the genetic makeup of axolotls to include the green fluorescent protein which is the protein that makes many jellyfish bioluminescent well not just making axolotls look cooler the glowing protein allows scientists to see things inside the axolotls that they couldn't before for example they'll tag cancerous cells with the protein and then they can actually see how it spreads throughout their bodies even more interesting is that axolotls have plug-and-play body parts you can amputate one axolotls leg and place it in another axolotl and it'll attach itself it's especially interesting because you don't even need the whole limb just a few cells if you take cells from a neon axolotl and place them on an amputated body of an albino axolotl the albino axolotl will actually grow in neon limb since their skin is quite translucent you could actually watch the neon green bone grow out of an otherwise white axolotl this has led to some fairly morally compromising work in a study published in science magazine in 1968 scientists were able to successfully transplant an axolotl head onto the back of another axolotl one subject lived for 65 weeks after the operation with second head growing right along with the first head what animal should I check out

{"page": 10, "lesson": 4, "title": "How to spot a liar - Pamela Meyer", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/NsdrST9h", "transcript": {"en": "Okay, now I don't want\nto alarm anybody in this room, but it's just come to my attention\nthat the person to your right is a liar. (Laughter) Also, the person to your left is a liar. Also the person sitting\nin your very seats is a liar. We're all liars. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you what the research\nsays about why we're all liars, how you can become a liespotter and why you might want\nto go the extra mile and go from liespotting to truth seeking, and ultimately to trust building. Now, speaking of trust, ever since I wrote\nthis book, \"Liespotting,\" no one wants to meet me in person\nanymore, no, no, no, no, no. They say, \"It's okay, we'll email you.\" (Laughter) I can't even get\na coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, \"Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking.\nHow about French cooking?\" So before I get started,\nwhat I'm going to do is I'm going to clarify my goal for you, which is not to teach a game of Gotcha. Liespotters aren't those nitpicky kids, those kids in the back of the room\nthat are shouting, \"Gotcha! Gotcha! Your eyebrow twitched.\nYou flared your nostril. I watch that TV show 'Lie To Me.'\nI know you're lying.\" No, liespotters are armed with scientific knowledge\nof how to spot deception. They use it to get to the truth, and they do what mature\nleaders do everyday; they have difficult conversations\nwith difficult people, sometimes during very difficult times. And they start up that path\nby accepting a core proposition, and that proposition is the following: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it, a lie has no power\nwhatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees\nto believe the lie. So I know it may sound like tough love, but look, if at some point\nyou got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth number one about lying:\nLying's a cooperative act. Now not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing\nparticipants in deception for the sake of social dignity, maybe to keep a secret that should\nbe kept secret, secret. We say, \"Nice song.\" \"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no.\" Or we say, favorite of the digiratti, \"You know, I just fished\nthat email out of my Spam folder. So sorry.\" But there are times when we are unwilling\nparticipants in deception. And that can have dramatic costs for us. Last year saw 997 billion dollars in corporate fraud alone\nin the United States. That's an eyelash\nunder a trillion dollars. That's seven percent of revenues. Deception can cost billions. Think Enron, Madoff, the mortgage crisis. Or in the case\nof double agents and traitors, like Robert Hanssen or Aldrich Ames, lies can betray our country, they can compromise our security,\nthey can undermine democracy, they can cause the deaths\nof those that defend us. Deception is actually serious business. This con man, Henry Oberlander,\nhe was such an effective con man, British authorities say he could have undermined the entire\nbanking system of the Western world. And you can't find this guy on Google;\nyou can't find him anywhere. He was interviewed once,\nand he said the following. He said, \"Look, I've got one rule.\" And this was Henry's rule, he said, \"Look, everyone is willing\nto give you something. They're ready to give you something\nfor whatever it is they're hungry for.\" And that's the crux of it. If you don't want to be\ndeceived, you have to know, what is it that you're hungry for? And we all kind of hate to admit it. We wish we were\nbetter husbands, better wives, smarter, more powerful, taller, richer -- the list goes on. Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were,\nhow we wish we could be, with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in\nthose gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show\nthat you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted, many of those are white lies. But in another study, it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes\nof meeting each other. (Laughter) Now when we first hear\nthis data, we recoil. We can't believe how prevalent lying is. We're essentially against lying. But if you look more closely,\nthe plot actually thickens. We lie more to strangers\nthan we lie to coworkers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves\nthan they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're an average married couple, you're going to lie to your spouse\nin one out of every 10 interactions. Now, you may think that's bad. If you're unmarried,\nthat number drops to three. Lying's complex. It's woven into the fabric\nof our daily and our business lives. We're deeply ambivalent about the truth. We parse it out on an as-needed basis, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because\nwe don't understand the gaps in our lives. That's truth number two about lying. We're against lying, but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned\nfor centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture,\nit's part of our history. Think Dante, Shakespeare,\nthe Bible, News of the World. (Laughter) Lying has evolutionary value\nto us as a species. Researchers have long known\nthat the more intelligent the species, the larger the neocortex, the more likely it is to be deceptive. Now you might remember Koko. Does anybody remember Koko the gorilla\nwho was taught sign language? Koko was taught to communicate\nvia sign language. Here's Koko with her kitten. It's her cute little, fluffy pet kitten. Koko once blamed her pet kitten\nfor ripping a sink out of the wall. (Laughter) We're hardwired to become\nleaders of the pack. It's starts really, really early. How early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn concealment. (Laughter) Two-year-olds bluff. Five-year-olds lie outright. They manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds, masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom\nin one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world\nand we're breadwinners, we enter a world that is just cluttered\nwith Spam, fake digital friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class Ponzi schemers, a deception epidemic -- in short, what one author calls\na post-truth society. It's been very confusing\nfor a long time now. What do you do? Well, there are steps we can take\nto navigate our way through the morass. Trained liespotters get to the truth\n90 percent of the time. The rest of us,\nwe're only 54 percent accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are good liars and bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes.\nWe all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto show you two patterns of deception. And then we're going\nto look at the hot spots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. (Video) Bill Clinton:\nI want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations\nwith that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to lie,\nnot a single time, never. And these allegations are false. And I need to go back to work\nfor the American people. Thank you. (Applause) Pamela Meyer: Okay,\nwhat were the telltale signs? Well first we heard what's known\nas a non-contracted denial. Studies show that people\nwho are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather\nthan informal language. We also heard\ndistancing language: \"that woman.\" We know that liars will unconsciously\ndistance themselves from their subject, using language as their tool. Now if Bill Clinton had said,\n\"Well, to tell you the truth ...\" or Richard Nixon's favorite,\n\"In all candor ...\" he would have been a dead giveaway for any liespotter that knows that qualifying language, as it's called,\nqualifying language like that, further discredits the subject. Now if he had repeated\nthe question in its entirety, or if he had peppered his account\nwith a little too much detail -- and we're all really glad\nhe didn't do that -- he would have further discredited himself. Freud had it right. Freud said, look,\nthere's much more to it than speech: \"No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent,\nhe chatters with his fingertips.\" And we all do it no matter\nhow powerful you are. We all chatter with our fingertips. I'm going to show you\nDominique Strauss-Kahn with Obama who's chattering with his fingertips. (Laughter) Now this brings us to our next pattern,\nwhich is body language. With body language,\nhere's what you've got to do. You've really got to just throw\nyour assumptions out the door. Let the science temper\nyour knowledge a little bit. Because we think liars\nfidget all the time. Well guess what, they're known to freeze\ntheir upper bodies when they're lying. We think liars won't look you in the eyes. Well guess what, they look\nyou in the eyes a little too much just to compensate for that myth. We think warmth and smiles\nconvey honesty, sincerity. But a trained liespotter\ncan spot a fake smile a mile away. Can you all spot the fake smile here? You can consciously contract\nthe muscles in your cheeks. But the real smile's in the eyes,\nthe crow's feet of the eyes. They cannot be consciously contracted, especially if you overdid the Botox. Don't overdo the Botox;\nnobody will think you're honest. Now we're going to look at the hot spots. Can you tell what's happening\nin a conversation? Can you start to find the hot spots to see the discrepancies between someone's words\nand someone's actions? Now, I know it seems really obvious, but when you're having a conversation\nwith someone you suspect of deception, attitude is by far the most overlooked\nbut telling of indicators. An honest person\nis going to be cooperative. They're going to show\nthey're on your side. They're going to be enthusiastic. They're going to be willing and helpful\nto getting you to the truth. They're going to be willing\nto brainstorm, name suspects, provide details. They're going to say, \"Hey, maybe it was those guys in payroll\nthat forged those checks.\" They're going to be infuriated\nif they sense they're wrongly accused throughout the entire course\nof the interview, not just in flashes; they'll be infuriated throughout\nthe entire course of the interview. And if you ask someone honest what should happen\nto whomever did forge those checks, an honest person is much more likely to recommend strict rather\nthan lenient punishment. Now let's say you're having\nthat exact same conversation with someone deceptive. That person may be withdrawn, look down, lower their voice, pause, be kind of herky-jerky. Ask a deceptive person\nto tell their story, they're going to pepper it\nwith way too much detail in all kinds of irrelevant places. And then they're going to tell their story\nin strict chronological order. And what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways\nover the course of several hours, they will ask that person\nto tell that story backwards, and then they'll watch them squirm, and track which questions produce\nthe highest volume of deceptive tells. Why do they do that?\nWell, we all do the same thing. We rehearse our words, but we rarely rehearse our gestures. We say \"yes,\" we shake our heads \"no.\" We tell very convincing stories,\nwe slightly shrug our shoulders. We commit terrible crimes, and we smile at the delight\nin getting away with it. Now, that smile is known\nin the trade as \"duping delight.\" And we're going to see that\nin several videos moving forward, but we're going to start --\nfor those of you who don't know him, this is presidential\ncandidate John Edwards who shocked America by fathering\na child out of wedlock. We're going to see him talk\nabout getting a paternity test. See now if you can spot him\nsaying, \"yes\" while shaking his head \"no,\" slightly shrugging his shoulders. (Video) John Edwards: I'd be happy\nto participate in one. I know that it's not possible\nthat this child could be mine, because of the timing of events. So I know it's not possible. Happy to take a paternity test,\nand would love to see it happen. Interviewer: Are you going to do\nthat soon? Is there somebody -- JE: Well, I'm only one side.\nI'm only one side of the test. But I'm happy to participate in one. PM: Okay, those head shakes\nare much easier to spot once you know to look for them. There are going to be times\nwhen someone makes one expression while masking another that just\nkind of leaks through in a flash. Murderers are known to leak sadness. Your new joint venture partner\nmight shake your hand, celebrate, go out to dinner with you\nand then leak an expression of anger. And we're not all going to become\nfacial expression experts overnight here, but there's one I can teach you\nthat's very dangerous and it's easy to learn, and that's the expression of contempt. Now with anger, you've got\ntwo people on an even playing field. It's still somewhat\nof a healthy relationship. But when anger turns to contempt,\nyou've been dismissed. It's associated with moral superiority. And for that reason, it's very,\nvery hard to recover from. Here's what it looks like. It's marked by one lip corner\npulled up and in. It's the only asymmetrical expression. And in the presence of contempt,\nwhether or not deception follows -- and it doesn't always follow -- look the other way,\ngo the other direction, reconsider the deal, say, \"No thank you. I'm not coming up\nfor just one more nightcap. Thank you.\" Science has surfaced\nmany, many more indicators. We know, for example, we know liars will shift their blink rate, point their feet towards an exit. They will take barrier objects and put them between themselves\nand the person that is interviewing them. They'll alter their vocal tone, often making their vocal tone much lower. Now here's the deal. These behaviors are just behaviors. They're not proof of deception. They're red flags. We're human beings. We make deceptive flailing gestures\nall over the place all day long. They don't mean anything\nin and of themselves. But when you see clusters\nof them, that's your signal. Look, listen, probe,\nask some hard questions, get out of that very comfortable\nmode of knowing, walk into curiosity mode,\nask more questions, have a little dignity, treat the person\nyou're talking to with rapport. Don't try to be like those folks\non \"Law & Order\" and those other TV shows that pummel their subjects\ninto submission. Don't be too aggressive, it doesn't work. Now, we've talked a little bit\nabout how to talk to someone who's lying and how to spot a lie. And as I promised, we're now going\nto look at what the truth looks like. But I'm going to show you two videos, two mothers -- one is lying,\none is telling the truth. And these were surfaced by researcher\nDavid Matsumoto in California. And I think they're an excellent example\nof what the truth looks like. This mother, Diane Downs, shot her kids at close range, drove them to the hospital\nwhile they bled all over the car, claimed a scraggy-haired stranger did it. And you'll see when you see the video, she can't even pretend\nto be an agonizing mother. What you want to look for here\nis an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes\nand her very, very cool demeanor. And if you look closely, you'll see\nduping delight throughout this video. (Video) Diane Downs:\nAt night when I close my eyes, I can see Christie reaching\nher hand out to me while I'm driving, and the blood just kept\ncoming out of her mouth. And that -- maybe\nit'll fade too with time -- but I don't think so. That bothers me the most. PM: Now I'm going to show you a video of an actual grieving mother,\nErin Runnion, confronting her daughter's murderer\nand torturer in court. Here you're going to see no false emotion, just the authentic expression\nof a mother's agony. (Video) Erin Runnion:\nI wrote this statement on the third anniversary\nof the night you took my baby, and you hurt her, and you crushed her, you terrified her until her heart stopped. And she fought, and I know she fought you. But I know she looked at you\nwith those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her. And I don't understand it, and I never will. PM: Okay, there's no doubting\nthe veracity of those emotions. Now the technology\naround what the truth looks like is progressing on, the science of it. We know, for example, that we now have specialized eye trackers\nand infrared brain scans, MRI's that can decode the signals\nthat our bodies send out when we're trying to be deceptive. And these technologies are going\nto be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit, and they will prove\nincredibly useful some day. But you've got to ask yourself\nin the meantime: Who do you want on your side\nof the meeting, someone who's trained\nin getting to the truth or some guy who's going to drag\na 400-pound electroencephalogram through the door? Liespotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, \"Character's who you are in the dark.\" And what's kind of interesting\nis that today, we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day. It's transparent\nwith blogs and social networks broadcasting the buzz\nof a whole new generation of people that have made a choice to live\ntheir lives in public. It's a much more noisy world. So one challenge we have is to remember, oversharing, that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting\ncan blind us to the fact that the subtleties\nof human decency -- character integrity -- that's still what matters,\nthat's always what's going to matter. So in this much noisier world, it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit\nabout our moral code. When you combine the science\nof recognizing deception with the art of looking, listening, you exempt yourself\nfrom collaborating in a lie. You start up that path\nof being just a little bit more explicit, because you signal to everyone around you, you say, \"Hey, my world, our world,\nit's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be\none where truth is strengthened and falsehood is recognized\nand marginalized.\" And when you do that, the ground around you starts\nto shift just a little bit. And that's the truth. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Lying is a/an ______ act.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "argumentative"}, {"label": "B", "text": "responsive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "courageous"}, {"label": "D", "text": "cooperative"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "One study showed that strangers lied ____ time(s) within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "one"}, {"label": "B", "text": "three"}, {"label": "C", "text": "five"}, {"label": "D", "text": "seven"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Trained liespotters get to the truth ____ percent of the time.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100"}, {"label": "C", "text": "88"}, {"label": "D", "text": "90"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following most closely characterizes “duping delight”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "smile"}, {"label": "B", "text": "frown"}, {"label": "C", "text": "shrug"}, {"label": "D", "text": "grimince"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Liespotters rely on _____ tools.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "mutal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "human"}, {"label": "C", "text": "public"}, {"label": "D", "text": "private"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 10, "lesson": 5, "title": "How fast can a vaccine be made? - Dan Kwartler", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-fast-can-a-vaccine-be-made-dan-kwartler", "transcript": {"en": "When a new pathogen emerges, our bodies and healthcare systems\nare left vulnerable. In times like these,\nthere’s an urgent need for a vaccine to create widespread immunity\nwith minimal loss of life. So how quickly can we develop vaccines\nwhen we need them most? Vaccine development can generally \nbe split into three phases. In exploratory research, scientists \nexperiment with different approaches to find safe and replicable \nvaccine designs. Once these are vetted in the lab, \nthey enter clinical testing, where vaccines are evaluated \nfor safety, efficacy, and side effects across a variety of populations. Finally, there’s manufacturing, where vaccines are produced \nand distributed for public use. Under regular circumstances, this process\ntakes an average of 15 to 20 years. But during a pandemic, \nresearchers employ numerous strategies to move through each stage \nas quickly as possible. Exploratory research is perhaps \nthe most flexible. The goal of this stage \nis to find a safe way to introduce our immune system \nto the virus or bacteria. This gives our body the information\nit needs to create antibodies capable of fighting a real infection. There are many ways to safely trigger\nthis immune response, but generally, the most effective \ndesigns are also the slowest to produce. Traditional attenuated vaccines \ncreate long lasting resilience. But they rely on weakened viral strains that must be cultivated in non-human\ntissue over long periods of time. Inactivated vaccines take \na much faster approach, directly applying heat, acid, or radiation\nto weaken the pathogen. Sub-unit vaccines, that inject \nharmless fragments of viral proteins, can also be created quickly. But these faster techniques produce\nless robust resilience. These are just three \nof many vaccine designs, each with their own pros and cons. No single approach is guaranteed to work, and all of them require \ntime-consuming research. So the best way to speed things up \nis for many labs to work on different models \nsimultaneously. This race-to-the-finish strategy produced the first testable \nZika vaccine in 7 months, and the first testable COVID-19 vaccine\nin just 42 days. Being testable doesn’t mean \nthese vaccines will be successful. But models that are deemed safe \nand easily replicable can move into clinical testing while other\nlabs continue exploring alternatives. Whether a testable vaccine is produced\nin four months or four years, the next stage is often the longest and \nmost unpredictable stage of development. Clinical testing consists of three phases,\neach containing multiple trials. Phase I trials focus on the intensity \nof the triggered immune response, and try to establish that the vaccine \nis safe and effective. Phase II trials focus on determining \nthe right dosage and delivery schedule across a wider population. And Phase III trials determine safety across the vaccine’s primary \nuse population, while also identifying rare side effects\nand negative reactions. Given the number of variables \nand the focus on long-term safety, it’s incredibly difficult to speed up \nclinical testing. In extreme circumstances, \nresearchers run multiple trials within one phase at the same time. But they still need to meet \nstrict safety criteria before moving on. Occasionally, labs can expedite \nthis process by leveraging previously approved treatments. In 2009, researchers adapted \nthe seasonal flu vaccine to treat H1N1— producing a widely available vaccine\nin just six months. However, this technique only works\nwhen dealing with familiar pathogens that have well-established \nvaccine designs. After a successful Phase III trial, \na national regulatory authority reviews the results and approves \nsafe vaccines for manufacturing. Every vaccine has a unique blend \nof biological and chemical components that require a specialized pipeline \nto produce. To start production as soon \nas the vaccine is approved, manufacturing plans must be designed\nin parallel to research and testing. This requires constant coordination\nbetween labs and manufacturers, as well as the resources to adapt\nto sudden changes in vaccine design— even if that means scrapping\nmonths of work. Over time, advances in exploratory\nresearch and manufacturing should make this process faster. Preliminary studies suggest \nthat future researchers may be able to swap genetic material\nfrom different viruses into the same vaccine design. These DNA and mRNA based vaccines\ncould dramatically expedite all three stages of vaccine production. But until such breakthroughs arrive, our best strategy is for labs \naround the world to cooperate and work in parallel \non different approaches. By sharing knowledge and resources, scientists can divide and conquer \nany pathogen."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of these are not a phase of developing a vaccine?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Clinical testing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exploratory"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Manufacturing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cultivation"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the length of the traditional process for creating a vaccine?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5-10 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10-15 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "15-20 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20-25 years"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is part of the faster acting inactivated vaccines?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Applying Acid"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reduced temperature"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Inoculation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cultivation"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "During which Phase of the clinical trial are the vaccines side effects and negative reactions determined?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "I"}, {"label": "B", "text": "II"}, {"label": "C", "text": "III"}, {"label": "D", "text": "IV"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How fast was the H1N1 vaccine produced?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "6 months"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1 year"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10 years"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

{"page": 10, "lesson": 9, "title": "Home sweet habitat: Crash Course Kids", "category": "Environmental Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/q5jrgQT5", "transcript": {"en": "[Music] Picture a polar bear...in the desert. No, what you're imagining is way too cute. Take off the sunglasses and the swim trunks. There. He's hot. He's hungry. He's downright miserable. Why is he such a grumpy bear? Well, it's because he's not where he belongs. There aren't any tasty seals to eat, \nno cold water to enjoy, and no snow to sleep in. The desert isn't his habitat. You know that a habitat is \nthe area where something lives, but from polar bears to porcupines, \nanimals don't just need a place to live -- they also rely on the other living and \nnon-living things around them to survive. And life looks different in \ndifferent places around the world. So, what makes a habitat a home? Well, what do you need? I need sandwiches, pancakes, \ncarrots, maybe some nice peaches... so I need food, and I need water. \nI need a place to live. And I need a place to film Crash Course videos. You could say this is my habitat. Animals need these things, too! Food, water, shelter, and space to live. For animals, their food comes \nfrom their neighbors, the other living things in their habitat. You know that plants and animals all \nfall somewhere along the food chain, which is a model we use to describe \nthe flow of energy between living things. But the real world is made up of \nlots and lots of food chains, and those chains can get kind of messy. I mean, look at our polar bear. Sure, \nhis favorite food is seal, but in a pinch, he'll eat walrus, dead whales, bird's eggs, \nand if he has absolutely no other choice, plants. The polar bear is at the top of \nmultiple food chains, and that's not unusual -- most animals \ndon't just eat one thing, and neither do I. I'm at the top of the pancake food \nchain and the carrot food chain. It just so happens I prefer pancakes. So, you can see how food chains are actually \nall tangled around with each other, with many different ones overlapping, \nkind of like a web. So, we call this a \"food web.\" Food webs are big, tangled systems that include \nevery plant and animal in a habitat. And, as you might guess, \nall food webs are different. Let's compare two different habitats \nto see how the food webs play out. First, we'll go back to our old stomping ground: the forest. Let's begin with (you know\n this, people!) the plants: trees, grass, and other plants that \nchange energy from the sun into sugar. But then you have some animals \nthat eat other animals. This is where things get a little more complicated. Today, an owl makes a mouse his lunch,\nbut tomorrow it may be a rabbit. Today, a snake snacks on a squirrel, \nbut a few days later, our owl friend might make a meal of \nanother meat eater, like the snake. Finally, the decomposers: \ninsects, fungi, and bacteria are breaking down whatever's left over --\nfrom uneaten, rotten fruit to leftover animal carcasses. As they break down matter, they provide more nutrients for the plants. It's a bit of a different story up in \nthe Arctic. I mean, look at all that ice! I know what you're thinking: \nwhere are the plants? How do we have a food web without plants? Zoom in on the sea water. \nZoom way in-- further, further, stop! Can you see those tiny plants? \nThey're called phytoplankton. And just like plants on land, \nthey convert energy from the sun. Really small creatures called zooplankton \neat the phytoplankton. And all kinds of small fish \ndine on the zooplankton. Larger fish eat the smaller fish. There are big marine mammals, too. Beluga whales eat fish, while humpback whales \neat the tiny plankton and krill. And what else eats fish? Seals. \nThat's our polar bear's favorite food, but up here, you can't afford to be picky, so he may \nhave to nibble on some whale carcass if necessary. As for decomposers, there aren't many \nbugs or earthworms in this cold climate. There are bacteria, but since it's so cold, the decomposers break down matter \nmuch more slowly than in the forest. So, you can see, food webs \nand the ecosystems that support them look different in different parts of the world, depending on the habitat conditions. Flat or mountainous land, \nmore or less water... these seemingly small changes in habitats \naffect what kind of plants and animals live there. Up in the Arctic, a polar bear has the right conditions to keep him happy. First, he fits into his food web perfectly. The food that's available to him has enough \nfat and protein to keep his energy up. Second, he fits into his habitat perfectly. He has the body adaptations to not just survive, \nbut feel really comfortable in the super cold. A polar bear isn't built to survive \nin the desert or the forest. So, let's put our poor polar bear \nback where he belongs.

{"page": 10, "lesson": 10, "title": "Meat-eating plants", "category": "Environmental Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/fhUnNvA4", "transcript": {"en": "[music] We all know that we have to eat different\nkinds of food to get the nutrition that we need. So eating plants is a great idea if you want\nto be healthy. That’s why I like to eat things like carrots, and spinach and tomatoes. I like to eat plants, but what if plants...\ntried to eat animals? Well, there are actually a few kinds of plants\nthat are carnivorous, meaning they eat meat. Now when I say meat, I’m not talking about\nchicken nuggets or hamburgers. I’m talking about really small animals,\nlike insects, spiders, and frogs. Creatures like these have to be extra careful\naround meat-eating plants! Probably the most famous carnivorous plant\nis known as the Venus Flytrap. Venus Flytraps have leaves at the tops of\ntheir stems that kind of look like tiny, toothy mouths. They’re not really mouths, but they serve\nthe same purpose: to eat flies, and other insects. Usually, the trap’s leaves are wide open.\nAnd the inside of the trap smells like food to insects. So they fly or crawl right into\nit, looking for a meal. But if they aren’t careful, they become\nthe meal instead. On each half of the trap, there are three\ntiny hairs. If an insect touches two of those hairs, the trap shuts, and the slender spines\naround the edges of the leaves close together tightly,  trapping the insect inside. Then the trap slowly digests its meal, meaning\nit breaks its food down into smaller pieces. It’s too bad for that little insect, but\nit will provide energy for that plant to live. And Venus Flytraps aren’t the only kind\nof carnivorous plant. Some plants, called sundews, attract bugs\nwith colorful red and green leaves that are covered with a sweet, sticky “dew” that\nsparkles in the sunlight. The thing is, this dew acts like a kind of\nglue. Any bug that lands on its leaves looking for\na meal will get stuck. And soon the plant just starts digesting it, soaking up nutrients\nfrom the bug’s body right through the leaves. Now, some other carnivorous plants can consume\neven bigger prey. Pitcher plants, for example, have big, brightly\ncolored leaves, curled up into the shape of a tube. At the bottom of the tube sits a little pool\nof sweet liquid called nectar. Once again, lots of different creatures are drawn to its\ntasty smell. They creep, crawl, jump, or fly to the edge\nof the tube to see what’s in there to eat. But the top is really slippery, and there\nare stiff hairs all along the inside of the tube pointing down -- so once a creature starts\nto fall in, they can’t get out. This clever kind of trap has allowed pitcher\nplants to catch not just bugs,  but also make meals of small frogs and even mice! And finally, there are some meat-eating plants\nthat don’t even live on land. Bladderworts, for example, live and catch\ntheir prey in water. These plants have tiny containers on their\nstems called bladders that float underwater. Each bladder has an opening with a tiny flap\non it, that can open and close, like a hidden trapdoor. When insects, like water fleas, trigger tiny\nhairs near the trapdoor, the door swings open, and sucks the little creature in. So now you know -- certain plants sometimes\neat animals. Like I said, it’s nice to have variety in\nyour diet! Thanks for watching SciShow Kids. Till next\ntime!

{"page": 10, "lesson": 11, "title": "Why is that baby staring at me?", "category": "Developmental Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/vhWcIhRO", "transcript": {"en": "[INTRO ♪] So you’re in line at the grocery store,\nand there’s a parent holding a baby right in front of you. You’re minding your own business, but when\nyou look up, that baby just won’t stop staring at you\nlike you’re the most interesting thing on the planet. You might feel like you’ve grown a second\nhead, or like you have chocolate smeared all over\nyour mouth, but in reality, that baby just likes looking\nat your face. Because there’s a lot to figure out there! From very early in life, babies seem to like\nlooking at faces, or even just configurations of shapes that\nlook like faces. They also prefer faces they recognize to ones\nthey don’t, but they’ll sometimes spend a little more\ntime looking at strangers because they’re new or different. Faces are important to babies because they’re\nbasically completely helpless and have to rely on their\ncaregivers to survive. They need to be able to find and communicate\nwith the people who feed them and change their diapers, and knowing what they look like is an important\npart of that. Even if said communication just involves screaming\nat the top of their lungs for a while. Babies are also busy taking in huge amounts\nof information to help them understand the world, and faces\ncan teach them a lot. From our expressions to how our mouths form\nwords, a lot of our communication as humans happens\nthrough our faces. In those first few months of life, babies\nare not only beginning to learn how to recognize their parents or grandparents, but also about all the emotions conveyed by\nfacial expressions. There’s a lot to learn! So when a baby is staring at you in the grocery\nstore, her little brain is probably trying to figure\nif she knows you and what categories your face fits into, like\nif you’re happy or sad. Now, babies might be born ready to learn from\nthe world around them, but there’s still some question about whether\nlooking at faces is an innate characteristic— one you’re born with—or if it’s influenced\nby experience. And, like with a lot of the age-old, nature\nversus nurture debate, it’s a little bit of both. On the nature side, there’s some evidence\nthat, within hours to days of being born, babies can copy facial expressions they see,\nlike if you stick out your tongue at them. Not all studies agree with those results,\nbut it’s possible that there’s an innate ability for finding and mimicking\nexpressions. Other research has found that within hours\nof birth, babies can discriminate between their mother’s\nface and a stranger’s, which might mean their brain is ready to recognize\nfaces without much information. So, some evidence suggests that babies may\nbe predisposed to look for information from faces right when\nthey’re born. But other studies have shown that it takes\nexperience to get really good at it. Either way, all the time babies and their\ncaregivers spend looking at each other causes rapid improvement in babies’ abilities\nto process and recognize faces. Starting around 3 months old, they even begin\nto group different kinds of faces— like human versus animals and kids versus\nadults. One especially cool study had babies and adults\nlook at a series of different monkey faces, and also at a bunch of different adult human\nfaces. They found that 6-month-old babies are actually\nbetter at differentiating between monkey faces than\nadults are! But when they’re about 9 months old, that\nability goes away because of what’s called perceptual narrowing, where their perception starts to change based\non their experience. Basically, the baby learns that paying attention\nto the differences in human faces is way more important for its life than the\ndifferences in monkey faces, so it should focus more on humans than monkeys. As the brain develops over time, the pathways\nused to recognize human faces get more efficient, and the ones\nfor monkeys get pruned away. But when researchers expose babies to lots\nof monkey faces between when they’re 6 and 9 months old, they effectively teach their brains that monkeys\nare important to pay attention to, so they keep that ability for a lot longer. Even though babies are born with some skills, experience helps tell them what parts of the\nworld they should pay attention to, and that shapes how their brain’s perception\nand recognition systems develop. So, it’s a little bit of nature and a little\nbit of nurture that goes into that cute, big-eyed baby staring\nat you. And yeah, in that moment, your face might\njust be the most interesting thing on the planet. But don’t rule out the possibility that\nyou might have a little chocolate on your face, too.

you might know of dyslexia as a reading disorder or that one condition that makes letters seem to float around on the page and that's understandable because it does mess with people's ability to read but it's more complex than letters flipping around and floating away years of research suggests that people with dyslexia might struggle with processing letters because they also have trouble processing of all things rhythm people with dyslexia tend to read more slowly than others misspelled words or confuse letters that look similar and the disorder is far from being uncommon most estimates say it affects at least 1 in 10 people but despite its impacts on reading dyslexia may actually be caused at least in part by something more Musical whether you realize it or not language has a whole lot of rhythm whole lotta rhythm a whole lotta rhythm a whole lot of rhythm a whole lotta rhythm just like that and I'm not talking about like beat boxing or slam poetry or whatever I just did I'm talking about everyday speech think about it like this if you say a word like difficult there's a right way to stress and pitch those sounds difficult is right and difficult just it sounds kind of weird this rhythm that's built into language is known as prosody most people have no trouble processing it they do it without even thinking but a study published in 2011 showed that people with dyslexia tend to have a harder time with this they're much less able to tell if a miss stressed word is pronounced right or wrong and if you have trouble parsing the rhythmic stress patterns and words that can make it extra tricky to match letters to the sounds of words in other words if you don't have a good internal representation of what the word is supposed to sound like when you read something there are fewer clues to help you link letters on the page to the meaning of the word scientists believe this might happen because of differences in the way dyslexic brains sample sound according to the theory of temporal sampling as sensory information like speech enters your brain your brain takes snapshots of that information so it doesn't just absorb information continuously it takes a bunch of snapshots at different rates some quicker than others and it uses those snapshots to put together an image or in this case an auditory representation of the signals it's receiving if we stick with the camera metaphor for a sec you can imagine the brain as a camera trying to take a picture of a hummingbird a non dyslexic brain is like a camera with a fast shutter speed it captures a clear moment in time even though the hummingbirds wings are beating really quickly on the other hand a dyslexic brain is more like a camera with a slower shutter speed so instead of capturing the wings clearly it captures a blur in the real world what that means is that sometimes a dyslexic brain doesn't process rhythmic information as fast as it's arriving as a result someone with dyslexia may not lock into rhythms and language as well as someone without dyslexia the difference or at least one of them seems to be in a part of the brain called the arcuate fasciculus which is a kind of connective highway between parts of the brain involved in language and those with dyslexia the arcuate fasciculus is smaller with less white matter to carry information and the fewer connections the harder it becomes to pass information around those language areas along with its role in language the arcuate fasciculus is also really important for music in fact there's some evidence that people with dyslexia could make use of this connection between language and music to improve their reading skills a 2016 study used what's called cognitive musical training or CMT on two groups of children between 8 and 12 years old 12 children had dyslexia and 22 had typical reading skills for 18 hours either spread over three days or six weeks these children practice musical exercises like tapping out rhythms learning about pitch and duration and playing simple melodies before and after their training researchers tested their ability to tell apart similar sounds such as ba and pas as well as pick out examples of incorrect stress in three syllable words the results showed that following CMT training the kids with dyslexia got significantly better at distinguishing sounds from one another as well as picking up on incorrect prosody on top of that a further study by those same authors found that following the six-week training dyslexic kids reading skills improved even without any specific reading training the idea of using this connection between music and language is really exciting but the science isn't settled yet so while studies like this one found strong effects on reading others just haven't so for the moment psychologists need to better understand what exactly might be influencing improvements in reading and whether or not other experiments can get the same results dyslexia is just one of the many variations and how our brains and the world around us but thanks to its complexity it has a lot to show us about how we process things like language and rhythm and use them to make sense of our world thanks for watching this episode of scishow psyche and a special thank you to our patrons for supporting the work we do it takes a lot of people to make a scishow video and we

{"page": 10, "lesson": 14, "title": "How racism makes us sick - David R. Williams", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/oRaEODBk", "transcript": {"en": "An article in the Yale Alumni Magazine told the story of Clyde Murphy, a black man who was a member\nof the Class of 1970. Clyde was a success story. After Yale and a law degree from Columbia, Clyde spent the next 30 years as one of America's\ntop civil rights lawyers. He was also a great husband and father. But despite his success, personally and professionally, Clyde's story had a sad ending. In 2010, at the age of 62, Clyde died from a blood clot in his lung. Clyde's experience was not unique. Many of his black classmates from Yale also died young. In fact, the magazine article indicated that 41 years after graduation from Yale, the black members of the Class of 1970 had a death rate\nthat was three times higher than that of the average class member. It's stunning. America has recently awakened to a steady drumbeat of unarmed black men\nbeing shot by the police. What is even a bigger story is that every seven minutes, a black person dies prematurely\nin the United States. That is over 200 black people die every single day who would not die if the health\nof blacks and whites were equal. For the last 25 years, I have been on a mission to understand why does race matter so profoundly for health. When I started my career, many believed that it was simply\nabout racial differences in income and education. I discovered that while\neconomic status matters for health, there is more to the story. So for example, if we look\nat life expectancy at age 25, at age 25 there's a five-year gap\nbetween blacks and whites. And the gap by education\nfor both whites and blacks is even larger than the racial gap. At the same time,\nat every level of education, whites live longer than blacks. So whites who are high school dropouts live 3.4 years longer\nthan their black counterparts, and the gap is even larger among college graduates. Most surprising of all, whites who have graduated from high school live longer than blacks\nwith a college degree or more education. So why does race matter\nso profoundly for health? What else is it\nbeyond education and income that might matter? In the early 1990s, I was asked to review a new book on the health of black America. I was struck that almost every single one of its 25 chapters said that racism was a factor that was hurting\nthe health of blacks. All of these researchers were stating that racism was a factor\nadversely impacting blacks, but they provided no evidence. For me, that was not good enough. A few months later, I was speaking at a conference\nin Washington, DC, and I said that one\nof the priorities for research was to document the ways\nin which racism affected health. A white gentleman stood in the audience and said that while he agreed\nwith me that racism was important, we could never measure racism. \"We measure self-esteem,\" I said. \"There's no reason why we can't measure racism\nif we put our minds to it.\" And so I put my mind to it and developed three scales. The first one captured\nmajor experiences of discrimination, like being unfairly fired\nor being unfairly stopped by the police. But discrimination also occurs\nin more minor and subtle experiences, and so my second scale,\ncalled the Everyday Discrimination Scale, captures nine items that captures experiences like you're treated\nwith less courtesy than others, you receive poorer service\nthan others in restaurants or stores, or people act as if they're afraid of you. This scale captures ways in which the dignity and the respect of people who society does not value is chipped away on a daily basis. Research has found that higher levels of discrimination are associated with an elevated risk\nof a broad range of diseases from blood pressure to abdominal obesity to breast cancer to heart disease and even premature mortality. Strikingly, some of the effects\nare observed at a very young age. For example, a study of black teens found that those who reported higher\nlevels of discrimination as teenagers had higher levels of stress hormones, of blood pressure and of weight at age 20. However, the stress of discrimination is only one aspect. Discrimination and racism also matters in other\nprofound ways for health. For example, there's\ndiscrimination in medical care. In 1999, the National Academy of Medicine asked me to serve on a committee that found, concluded\nbased on the scientific evidence, that blacks and other minorities receive poorer quality care than whites. This was true for all kinds\nof medical treatment, from the most simple to the most technologically sophisticated. One explanation for this pattern was a phenomenon\nthat's called \"implicit bias\" or \"unconscious discrimination.\" Research for decades\nby social psychologists indicates that if you hold\na negative stereotype about a group in your subconscious mind and you meet someone from that group, you will discriminate against that person. You will treat them differently. It's an unconscious process.\nIt's an automatic process. It is a subtle process, but it's normal and it occurs even among\nthe most well-intentioned individuals. But the deeper that I delved into the health impact of racism, the more insidious the effects became. There is institutional discrimination, which refers to discrimination that exists in the processes\nof social institutions. Residential segregation by race, which has led to blacks and whites living\nin very different neighborhood contexts, is a classic example\nof institutional racism. One of America's best-kept secrets is how residential segregation is the secret source that creates racial inequality\nin the United States. In America, where you live determines your access to opportunities in education, in employment, in housing and even\nin access to medical care. One study of the 171 largest\ncities in the United States concluded that there is not even one city where whites live\nunder equal conditions to blacks, and that the worst urban contexts\nin which whites reside is considerably better than the average\ncontext of black communities. Another study found that if you could eliminate statistically residential segregation, you would completely erase\nblack-white differences in income, education and unemployment, and reduce black-white differences\nin single motherhood by two thirds, all of that driven by segregation. I have also learned how the negative stereotypes and images of blacks in our culture literally create and sustain both institutional\nand individual discrimination. A group of researchers\nhave put together a database that contains the books, magazines and articles that an average college-educated\nAmerican would read over their lifetime. It allows us to look within this database and see how Americans\nhave seen words paired together as they grow up in their society. So when the word \"black\"\nappears in American culture, what co-occurs with it? \"Poor,\" \"violent,\" \"religious,\" \"lazy,\" \"cheerful,\" \"dangerous.\" When \"white\" occurs, the frequently co-occurring words are \"wealthy,\" \"progressive,\" \"conventional,\" \"stubborn,\" \"successful,\" \"educated.\" So when a police officer overreacts when he sees\nan unarmed black male and perceives him\nto be violent and dangerous, we are not necessarily dealing\nwith an inherently bad cop. We may be simply viewing a normal American who is reflecting\nwhat he has been exposed to as a result of being raised in this society. From my own experience, I believe that your race does not have to be\na determinant of your destiny. I migrated to the United States from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia in the late 1970s in pursuit of higher education, and in the last 40 years, I have done well. I have had a supportive family, I have worked hard, I have done well. But it took more for me to be successful. I received a minority fellowship\nfrom the University of Michigan. Yes. I am an affirmative action baby. Without affirmative action, I would not be here. But in the last 40 years, black America has been\nless successful than I have. In 1978, black households\nin the United States earned 59 cents for every dollar\nof income whites earned. In 2015, black families still earn 59 cents for every dollar of income\nthat white families receive, and the racial gaps in wealth\nare even more stunning. For every dollar of wealth\nthat whites have, black families have six pennies\nand Latinos have seven pennies. The fact is, racism is producing a truly rigged system that is systematically disadvantaging\nsome racial groups in the United States. To paraphrase Plato, there is nothing so unfair as the equal treatment of unequal people. And that's why I am committed to working to dismantle racism. I deeply appreciate the fact that I am standing on the shoulders of those who have sacrificed\neven their lives to open the doors that I have walked through. I want to ensure\nthat those doors remain open and that everyone\ncan walk through those doors. Robert Kennedy said, \"Each time a man\" --\nor woman, I would add -- \"stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and those ripples can build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls\nof oppression and resistance.\" I am optimistic today because all across America, I have seen ripples of hope. The Boston Medical Center has added lawyers to the medical team so that physicians can improve\nthe health of their patients because the lawyers are addressing\nthe nonmedical needs their patients have. Loma Linda University\nhas built a gateway college in nearby San Bernardino so that in addition\nto delivering medical care, they can provide job skills and job training to a predominantly minority,\nlow-income community members so that they will have the skills\nthey need to get a decent job. In Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the Abecedarian Project has figured out how to ensure that they have lowered\nthe risks for heart disease for blacks in their mid-30s by providing high-quality day care from birth to age five. In after-school centers\nacross the United States, Wintley Phipps and the US Dream Academy is breaking the cycle of incarceration by providing high-quality\nacademic enrichment and mentoring to the children of prisoners and children who have\nfallen behind in school. In Huntsville, Alabama, Oakwood University, a historically black institution, is showing how we can improve\nthe health of black adults by including a health evaluation as a part of freshman orientation and giving those students\nthe tools they need to make healthy choices and providing them annually\na health transcript so they can monitor their progress. And in Atlanta, Georgia, Purpose Built Communities has dismantled\nthe negative effects of segregation by transforming a crime-ridden, drug-infested public housing project into an oasis of mixed-income housing, of academic performance, of great community wellness and of full employment. And finally, there is the Devine solution. Professor Patricia Devine of the University of Wisconsin has shown us how we can attack our hidden biases head on and effectively reduce them. Each one of us can be a ripple of hope. This work will not always be easy, but former Supreme Court Justice\nThurgood Marshall has told us, \"We must dissent. We must dissent from the indifference. We must dissent from the apathy. We must dissent from the hatred\nand from the mistrust. We must dissent because America can do better, because America has no choice\nbut to do better.\" Thank you.

Of the hundred colonists on Mars, \n42 live on West Base, 26 on North Base, 15 on South Base, and 17 on East Base. For our purposes, let’s assume \nthat everyone prefers the space port to be as close to their base as possible, \nand will vote accordingly. What is the fairest way \nto conduct that vote? The most straightforward solution \nwould be to just let each individual cast a single ballot, and choose \nthe location with the most votes. This is known as plurality voting, \nor \"first past the post.\" In this case, West Base wins easily, since it has more residents \nthan any other. And yet, most colonists would consider \nthis the worst result, given how far it is from everyone else. So is plurality vote \nreally the fairest method? What if we tried a system \nlike instant runoff voting, which accounts for the full range \nof people’s preferences rather than just their top choices? Here’s how it would work. First, voters rank \neach of the options from 1 to 4, and we compare their top picks. South receives the fewest votes \nfor first place, so it’s eliminated. Its 15 votes get allocated \nto those voters’ second choice— East Base— giving it a total of 32. We then compare top preferences \nand cut the last place option again. This time North Base is eliminated. Its residents’ second choice \nwould’ve been South Base, but since that’s already gone,\nthe votes go to their third choice. That gives East 58 votes over West’s 42, \nmaking it the winner. But this doesn’t seem fair either. Not only did East start out \nin second-to-last place, but a majority ranked it among \ntheir two least preferred options. Instead of using rankings, we could try \nvoting in multiple rounds, with the top two winners \nproceeding to a separate runoff. Normally, this would mean West and North \nwinning the first round, and North winning the second. But the residents of East Base realize that while they don’t have \nthe votes to win, they can still skew the results \nin their favor. In the first round, they vote \nfor South Base instead of their own, successfully keeping North \nfrom advancing. Thanks to this \"tactical voting\"\nby East Base residents, South wins the second round easily,\ndespite being the least populated. Can a system be called fair and good \nif it incentivizes lying about your preferences? Maybe what we need to do \nis let voters express a preference in every possible head-to-head matchup. This is known as the Condorcet method. Consider one matchup: \nWest versus North. All 100 colonists vote on their preference\nbetween the two. So that's West's 42 versus \nthe 58 from North, South, and East, who would all prefer North. Now do the same \nfor the other five matchups. The victor will be whichever base \nwins the most times. Here, North wins three \nand South wins two. These are indeed the two \nmost central locations, and North has the advantage of not being \nanyone’s least preferred choice. So does that make the Condorcet method \nan ideal voting system in general? Not necessarily. Consider an election \nwith three candidates. If voters prefer A over B, and B over C, \nbut prefer C over A, this method fails to select a winner. Over the decades, researchers \nand statisticians have come up with dozens of intricate ways \nof conducting and counting votes, and some have even been \nput into practice. But whichever one you choose, it's possible to imagine it delivering \nan unfair result. It turns out that our intuitive concept \nof fairness actually contains a number of assumptions \nthat may contradict each other.

It’s time for Squeaks and I to get out our\nswimsuits, our /cool/ shades, and head outside for some fun in the sun! But I need to make some smart choices before\nwe go outside. I need to wear sunscreen, because I don’t\nwant to end up getting a sunburn! Squeaks doesn’t need to worry about sunburns,\nsince he’s a robot. But we humans can get a sunburn when we stay\nout in the sun too long and don’t protect our skin. Even though the rays of the sun feel nice\nand warm, and are important for all kinds of life on the Earth, some of the rays from\nthe sun’s light can harm our skin. Now, our skin /does/ have something in it\nthat helps to protect it from these harmful rays. But sometimes, like when you’re outside\nall day, that’s not enough. If too many of these rays reach your skin,\nyour skin can become damaged, or hurt. When skin gets damaged, the body does its\nbest to fix it as soon as possible. It sends more blood to the damaged area, which\ncauses the skin there to get pink or red, and feel warm when you touch it. The damaged area can feel /really/ sore, and\nsome of the skin can also peel off. These are all signs of sunburn. There are lots of things that can affect whether\nyou get a sunburn or not. People with lighter skin sunburn more easily,\nand spending more time outside can also lead to more of a sunburn. But anyone can get a sunburn. Luckily, there are plenty of different things\nwe can do to keep from getting one. For example, wearing clothes that cover our\nskin and completely block the sun’s light can keep those harmful rays from getting to\nthe skin on our bodies. And wearing a hat can keep those rays from\ncausing a sunburn on our heads. We can also try to spend less time in the\nsun when its rays are brightest—that’s usually between ten in the morning and four\nin the afternoon. But one of the easiest things we can do is\nto wear sunscreen. Sunscreen can be a lotion, a cream, or a spray. But no matter what kind of sunscreen you use,\nit keeps some of the sun’s rays from getting to your skin, and can help stop a sunburn. Most sunscreens work by either soaking up\nthose harmful rays, kind of like a sponge, or by reflecting them, kind of like a mirror. Most experts say that you should put sunscreen\nat least ten minutes before you go outside. And you should put on lots of it! It’s a good idea to get some help putting\non sunscreen, especially in places that are kind of hard to reach, like all over your\nback. You might also want to get help putting it\non other places — especially places you might not think about, like your ears, the\nbacks of your legs, and the back of your neck! And once you get your sunscreen on, you should\nmake sure you keep it on! It’s a great idea to take a break every\nfew hours and to put on some more sunscreen, especially if you’re running around and\ngetting sweaty, or you’re swimming at the pool or the beach. So, enjoy your time in sun this summer … but\ndon’t forget to wear your sunscreen! Thanks for joining us for this episode of\nSciShow Kids!

{"page": 10, "lesson": 18, "title": "Why beavers are the smartest thing in fur pants", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/4R1SkQcp", "transcript": {"en": "One of my favorite things to do on this channel\nis to get you to look at the world you know in a different way, to take something you\nthought was ordinary, and show you why it’s amazing. Today I’m here in Alaska, and you’re never\ngonna look at beavers the same way again. They chew down trees, and they build dams. But what most people don’t know is without\nbeavers, North America–and much of the world–would be totally different than it is today. Beavers are one of the ultimate keystone species—a\nplant or animal so important to an ecosystem, that without it, the whole thing would basically\nbreak. Their dams create habitats for dozens of species,\nfilter and purify water, and enrich the soil by trapping sediment and nutrients. Beaver ponds reshape landscapes on such an\nenormous scale it impacts all other wildlife and vegetation in the area. Earth is home to two beaver species today:\none in Europe, and these here in North America. They’re the second largest rodents living\ntoday, and like most rodents they have big front teeth that never stop growing. Beaver teeth are actually reinforced with\niron, and with their enormous jaw muscles they use those teeth to slice through bark\nand chop down trees. Besides being carpenters, they even play the\npart of plumbers. When a beaver hears the sound of running water,\nit drives them nuts, they know the dam has sprung a leak and they have an uncontrollable\ninstinct to go patch it up. Beavers are ecosystem engineers second only\nto humans, and they stay pretty DAM busy keeping this pond nice and full. Beavers’ urge to build can sometimes cause\nheadaches, but NO beavers can be an even BIGGER problem. Before European colonists arrived, there were\nas many as 400 million beavers in the US and Canada! North America was covered with tens of millions\nof beaver dams. Imagine between 5 and 30 beavers on every\nkilometer of stream or river on the whole continent! That’s a lotta beavers. But over a few hundred years they were almost\nhunted to extinction. Beavers were big business. They were trapped for fur, mostly to make\nhats, but also for sacs on their butts full of castoreum—a pungent substance used in\nperfumes. The British Hudson’s Bay Company even tried\nto eradicate beavers from the Pacific Northwestv, figuring with no beavers left to hunt, the\nUnited States would stop its westward expansion. Wherever pioneers went, they killed every\nbeaver they could find, despite the fact that beavers were responsible for most of the farmland\nin the West. Populations dwindled from millions to the\nlow thousands. Without beaver dams, huge areas of land are\nleft with less water. hundreds of species (like fish, birds, insects,\nand amphibians) are left without a habitat. So… beaver dams are great for other species,\nbut what’s in it for the beavers? Why do they build them? For beavers the pond created by their dams\nis a safe place to build a home, called a lodge, where they raise their young and keep\naway from predators. Beavers are pretty awkward on land, but they\nare safe and happy in the water. The entrance to a beaver lodge is underwater,\nso beavers can safely scoot in and out. Since they don’t hibernate, this lets them\naccess underwater food stores even when their ponds are frozen over. Beavers’ favorite foods are the leaves and\nsoft outer bark of trees, but like most mammals, they don’t digest wood very well, so they\neat their excrement to get the most out of a meal… until it eventually comes out looking\nlike sawdust. A crew of beavers spotted in a pond is usually\na family. Beaver couples often mate for life and beaver\nkits live with their parents for a couple years while they practice their engineering\nskills. The oldest dams ever discovered are 100,000\nyears old telling us beavers or their close relatives have been altering our landscapes\neven before we moved in. And for most of the thousands of years we’ve\nlived together, we’ve lived in harmony. Now that we’ve realized how important they\nare, beaver populations are starting to recover. More beavers means more homes for\nfish and birds, fresher water, and less damage from flooding and forest fires. Beavers feature prominently in the oral histories\nof North America’s First Nations people, even playing a part in many creation myths,\nwhich is neat, because beavers really have created much of the landscape we live in,\nshowing us how old and important our relationship is with the smartest thing in fur pants. Stay curious! Beavers are big as rodents go today, but during\nthe Pleistocene, Earth was home to a beaver called Castoroides the size of a black bear.

A carnivorous plant more beautiful and ravenous\nthan any other. But that fantastical creature was no plant\n– it was a predator... dressed to kill. [OPEN] Blending in is a great way to stay alive,\nbut it can be just as useful for the hunter as the hunted. That butterfly-eating beast from Indonesia? That isn’t an orchid at all. It’s an orchid mantis, an insect native\nto the rainforests of Southeast Asia. These beautiful bugs exhibit a behavior called\naggressive mimicry: that’s using a disguise not to hide, but to stand out. It’s counterintuitive, but you’ve probably\ncome across one such creature before. Nope, not waldo. Like a snapping turtle’s wriggly worm-tongue,\nor an Angler fish’s luminous bait, some animals use the promise of food to conceal\nmore deadly intentions. Some parasites even mimic their hosts’ prey\nto get swallowed. Other mimics rely on smellovision to do the\ntrick. One spider attracts prey by sending out a\nchemical signal that female moths usually use to attract mates. Like the plants they’re named after, these\nmantises use their looks to flirt. Orchids display beautiful patterns to attract\ntheir favorite pollinators: bees and flies. And with their petaled legs wrapped in pinks\nand yellows, orchid mantises can disappear amongst those forests of flowers. They wear such a good disguise, that every\nso often an insect *looking* for dinner *becomes* dinner. At least, that’s what scientists thought…\nuntil one noticed something weird: orchid mantises don’t actually need any flowers\naround for their disguises to work. They attract prey even *better* than the real\nthing. To understand why, we have to think – and\nsee – like a flying insect. That means looking beyond our human senses. It would be hard for you or I to pluck an\norchid mantis from a flowery background. Our visual system picks up on the shapes,\nedges and finer details of the mantis’s disguise. Our brains see petals, and think “flower”. On the other hand, bees, flies – even beetles\nand butterflies see the floral fatales completely differently. Pollinator eyes and brains don’t pick up\non the fine details, but the bigger picture comes in loud and clear. To these prey animals, an orchid mantis doesn’t\njust look like a flower, it looks bigger and brighter than a flower – and there lies\nthe trick. Some flowering plants “get it on” with\nanything willing to stop by, but orchids are exclusive with their pollinators. One type only attracts male bees from a single\nspecies. If an orchid mantis’ disguise was too particular,\nit would limit the number of animals it might fool. Instead, by looking a little like every flower,\nthey can attract even more prey. These animal liars *fool* our brains too,\nbut orchid mantises didn’t *evolve* to fool human brains. In fact, the way they deceive us falls into\na totally different camouflage category: cryptic mimicry. Like their close kin, orchid mantises will\neven rock back and forth like a flower swaying in the breeze. We don’t know for sure, but scientists think\nlooking like an orchid could also help conceal them from predators like birds, lizards, and\nmonkeys in the same way. Pinning down how these predators and parasites\nevolved their deadly strategies of disguise has been almost impossible until recently. And we’re still figuring them out. Some disguises are so good, their true purpose\ncan be hard to see.

{"page": 10, "lesson": 21, "title": "What happens when you lose a balloon?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/BAVltnGJ", "transcript": {"en": "[ INTRO ] I’m so glad you’re still having fun with\nthat balloon, Squeaks! [Squeaks thanks her for saving it] Oh right! We did almost lose it earlier today. We were in the pizza store getting some lunch, and the balloon slipped out of Squeaks’\npaw! It went up to the ceiling, but the string\nwas hanging down far enough that I could grab it back. Then we tied it to a water bottle from my\nbackpack so it wouldn’t get away again. It’s a good thing it didn’t escape while\nwe were outside! [Squeaks asks what would have happened] Well, a couple of different things can happen\nto a balloon that escapes into the sky — the regular type of balloon, I mean, that’s\nmade out of the stretchy rubber stuff. First, the balloon starts to rise higher and\nhigher into the air. That’s because balloons aren’t filled\nwith regular air, like the kind we breathe. They’re filled with something called helium,\nand it makes the balloon lighter for its size than the air around it. So it starts to float on the air, just like\ncertain things float on water. If you try to push a plastic spoon to the\nbottom of a bowl of water, the spoon will just float to the top again. If someone lets go of a helium balloon outside,\nit starts to rise through the air like the spoon at the bottom of the bowl rises through\nthe water. But unlike the small amount of water in the\nbowl, there’s lots of air all around us, and it stretches up really high in the sky. So the balloon keeps floating higher and higher\nand higher. And as it goes higher, the air around it starts\nto change. The higher into the sky you go, the less air\nthere is. There’s still some air, but it becomes more\nspread out. And as the air outside the balloon spreads\nout, the helium inside the balloon starts to spread out, too, pushing out on the inside\nof the balloon. What happens next depends on the strength\nof the stuff the balloon is made of. If the balloon isn’t very strong, the helium\npushing on it will pop the balloon before it gets too high up. Then the pieces just fall back down to the\nground. That’s why it’s usually not a good idea\nto send balloons into the sky on purpose. When they come back down in those big pieces, they can hurt animals that think they’re\nfood and try to swallow them. But if the balloon is stronger, something\ndifferent will happen. It will keep floating higher and higher up\ninto the air — sometimes even as high as an airplane! But the air very high up in the sky isn’t\njust more spread out — it’s also much colder. When you’re as high up as airplanes go,\nit’s freeeeezing. And when rubber gets cold, it becomes stiffer\nand less stretchy. So eventually, with the cold combined with\nthe helium pushing on it from the inside, the balloon can actually /shatter/, breaking\ninto super tiny little pieces. Those also fall back down to the ground, but\nsince they’re so small you probably wouldn’t be able to see them. Whether it pops or shatters, the balloon always\ndoes two things: it goes up very high, as far as it can go! And then it comes back down. That’s actually what happened to your balloon\ntoo, Squeaks! Except, since we were inside, it could only go as\nhigh as the ceiling, and then we were able to pull it back down. Have you ever lost a balloon? What do you think happened to it?

But they’re not really alive, or moving\naround — it’s an illusion, a little trick that you can play on your brain. And today Squeaks and I are going to make\nour very own version of this trick, called a zoetrope. If we spin all these drawings together really\nfast, they just look like a blur. That’s why our zoetrope is going to have\nslits, which are little holes. We’ll see each drawing through the slit,\nand then see a black space after each one. It will be like we’re seeing each drawing\non its own, but super duper fast. And then when we spin the zoetrope, our brains\nwill stop noticing the black space and connect the drawings together. The faster the zoetrope spins, the smoother\nthe animation will be! You can make your own zoetrope along with\nus! All you need is: some black construction paper, some white\nconstruction paper, scissors, tape, a ruler, two pencils, a round piece of cardboard or a paper plate,\nabout 25 centimeters, or 10 inches across, and a grownup to help, because we’ll be\ndoing some measuring and cutting. For our base, we cut out this round piece\nof cardboard, although you can also use a paper plate. We’ll make a small hole in the middle, just\nbig enough to push one of the pencils through and have the eraser catch on the top. But we won’t put the pencil in yet. Next, we need to make the walls of the zoetrope. For that, we’ll use the black and white\npaper. First, we’ll cut two pieces of the black\npaper in half, the long way, so we have four long strips. Then we’ll take three of the strips and\ntape them together. Next, we’ll wrap them around the outside\nof the cardboard bas. We might need to trim a little off the end\nto make sure it fits exactly. This is where we’ll put the slits, to look\nthrough and see the animation! We’ll cut 13 slits, each about 3 millimeters,\nor an eighth of an inch wide, into the top half of the black strip. We’ll try to make them evenly spaced, about\n4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, apart. Just like we did with the black paper, we’ll\ncut a piece of white paper in half so we have two long strips. We’re going to take those two, and cut them\nin half. That gives us four long strips of paper. We’re going to take three of them, and tape\nthem all together. Our white strip is now half as tall as our\nblack strip… and we’re going to cut it so it’s the same length. The white strip of paper will become the rectangles\nwe use for each drawing. To make those rectangles, we’ll use the\nruler and one of the pencils to measure the strips into 13 rectangles that are each about\n4 centimeters, or one and a half inches, across. Now it’s time to draw! Our animation is going to be cyclical, which\nmeans that as soon as it’s done, it’s going to start over again from the beginning. So it’s good to have an animation that ends\nright back where it started – like a plane taking off and coming back down, or a person\ntaking off her hat and putting it back on. We’re going to draw our friend Dino flapping\nhis wings! Each of your frames should look a lot like\nthe last one, with tiny changes from one to the next. See how his wings move up and down just a\ntiny bit each rectangle? That will help the animation look smoother! Once our drawings are done, we’ll tape them\nto the bottom half of the black paper , with each rectangle right below one of the slits. Now we just need to tape the paper around\nthe base, with the drawings on the inside. Now all we need is to make it spin! So we just stick this pencil through the hole\nwe made in the base earlier, so the eraser catches on the frame and the pencil doesn’t\nfall all the way through. Nice! You could also use chopsticks for this, or\nglue the hole in your base to a marble, so that it can spin on a table. Or, with some help from a grown-up, you might\nbe able to use a record player or a spinning cake platform! And now … we spin. Oh cool! Check it out! If the drawings move fast enough, two illusions\nhappen to make them look like an animation. In between each frame, there’s a blank spot,\nwhere there’s nothing to see. But when the drawings come quickly enough,\none after the next, your brain stops noticing the blank spaces in between. That’s the first illusion — the effect\nof one frame on your eye lasts until the next one comes up. All your brain notices is the drawings. The second illusion is when your brain sees\nall those separate drawings and thinks that the pictures are moving! It fills in the blanks in between the frames\nfor you, and turns them into something that makes sense, like Dino flying! So you can just see the animation – and\nenjoy the cartoon. Squeaks, we make an awesome animation team! Did you make a zoetrope too? What would you want to make a cartoon about? We’d love to hear about it!
