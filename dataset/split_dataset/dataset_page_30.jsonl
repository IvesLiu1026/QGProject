Sure, you could throw \nin some hideous monsters, fountains of blood, and things jumping out from every corner, but as classic horror author\nH.P. Lovecraft wrote, \"The oldest and strongest\nkind of fear is fear of the unknown.\" And writers harness that fear\nnot by revealing horrors, but by leaving the audience hanging\nin anticipation of them. That is, in a state of suspense. The most familiar examples of suspense\ncome from horror films and mystery novels. What's inside the haunted mansion? Which of the dinner guests \nis the murderer? But suspense exists beyond these genres. Will the hero save the day? Will the couple get together\nin the end? And what is the dark secret that causes\nthe main character so much pain? The key to suspense is that it sets up\na question, or several, that the audience hopes \nto get an answer to and delays that answer while maintaining\ntheir interest and keeping them guessing. So what are some techniques you can use\nto achieve this in your own writing? Limit the point of view. Instead of an omniscient narrator who can\nsee and relay everything that happens, tell the story from the perspective\nof the characters. They may start off knowing just\nas little as the audience does, and as they learn more, so do we. Classic novels, like \"Dracula,\" for example,\nare told through letters and diary entries where characters relate\nwhat they've experienced and fear what's to come. Next, choose the right setting \nand imagery. Old mansions or castles with winding\nhalls and secret passageways suggest that disturbing things\nare being concealed. Nighttime, fog, and storms all play\nsimilar roles in limiting visibility and restricting characters' movements. That's why Victorian London is such\na popular setting. And even ordinary places and objects\ncan be made sinister as in the Gothic novel \"Rebecca\" where the flowers at the protagonist's\nnew home are described as blood red. Three: play with style and form. You can build suspense by carefully\npaying attention not just to what happens but how it's conveyed and paced. Edgar Allan Poe conveys the mental state\nof the narrator in \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" with fragmented sentences\nthat break off suddenly. And other short declarative sentences\nin the story create a mix of breathless speed\nand weighty pauses. On the screen, Alfred Hitchcock's\ncinematography is known for its use of extended\nsilences and shots of staircases to create a feeling of discomfort. Four: use dramatic irony. You can't just keep the audience\nin the dark forever. Sometimes, suspense is best served by revealing key parts of the big secret\nto the audience but not to the characters. This is a technique known \nas dramatic irony, where the mystery becomes\nnot what will happen but when and how \nthe characters will learn. In the classic play \"Oedipus Rex,\" the title character is unaware\nthat he has killed his own father and married his mother. But the audience knows, and watching\nOedipus gradually learn the truth provides the story \nwith its agonizing climax. And finally, the cliffhanger. Beware of overusing this one. Some consider it a cheap and easy trick,\nbut it's hard to deny its effectiveness. This is where a chapter, episode,\nvolume, or season cuts off right before something\ncrucial is revealed, or in the midst of a dangerous situation\nwith a slim chance of hope. The wait, whether moments or years, makes us imagine possibilities about\nwhat could happen next, building extra suspense. The awful thing is almost always averted, creating a sense of closure \nand emotional release. But that doesn't stop us from worrying\nand wondering the next time the protagonists face \nnear-certain disaster."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What did classic horror author H.P.

{"page": 30, "lesson": 2, "title": "Why should you read James Joyce's \"Ulysses\"? - Sam Slote", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-james-joyce-s-ulysses-sam-slote", "transcript": {"en": "James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" is widely considered\nto be both a literary masterpiece and one of the hardest works\nof literature to read. It inspires such devotion that once a year\non a day called Bloomsday, thousands of people all over the world\ndress up like the characters, take to the streets, and read the book aloud. And some even make a pilgrimage\nto Dublin just to visit the places so vividly\ndepicted in Joyce's opus. So what is it about this famously\ndifficult novel that inspires so many people? There's no one simple answer\nto that question, but there are a few remarkable things\nabout the book that keep people coming back. The plot, which transpires over\nthe course of a single day, is a story of three characters: Stephen Dedalus, reprised from \nJoyce's earlier novel, \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\"; Leopold Bloom, a half-Jewish advertising\ncanvasser for a Dublin newspaper; and Bloom's wife Molly, who is about\nto embark on an affair. Stephen is depressed because\nof his mother's recent death. Meanwhile, Bloom wanders \nthroughout the city. He goes to a funeral, his work, a pub, and so on, avoiding going home because Molly\nis about to begin her affair. Where it really starts \nto get interesting, though, is how the story's told. Each chapter is written \nin a different style. 15 is a play, 13 is like a cheesy romance novel, 12 is a story with bizarre,\nexaggerated interruptions, 11 uses techniques, like onomatopoeia,\nrepetitions, and alliteration to imitate music, and 14 reproduces the evolution\nof English literary prose style, from its beginnings in Anglo-Saxon\nright up to the 20th century. That all culminates in the final chapter which follows Molly's \nstream of consciousness as it spools out in just \neight long paragraphs with almost no punctuation. The range of styles\nJoyce uses in \"Ulysses\" is one of the things \nthat makes it so difficult, but it also helps make it enjoyable. And it's one of the reasons that\nthe book is held up as one of the key texts \nof literary modernism, a movement characterized by overturning\ntraditional modes of writing. Joyce fills his narrative \ngymnastic routines with some of the most imaginative \nuse of language you'll find anywhere. Take, for instance, \"The figure seated on a large boulder \nat the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested \nstronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed \nlargenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairlegged\nruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero.\" Here, Joyce exaggerates the description\nof a mangy old man in a pub to make him seem like an improbably\ngigantesque hero. It's true that some sections \nare impenetrably dense at first glance, but it's up to the reader \nto let their eyes skim over them or break out a shovel and dig in. And once you start excavating the text, you'll find the book to be an encyclopedic\ntreasure trove. It's filled with all manner of references\nand allusions from medieval philosophy\nto the symbolism of tattoos, and from Dante to Dublin slang. As suggested by the title, some of these\nallusions revolve around Homer's \"Odyssey.\" Each chapter is named after a character\nor episode from the \"Odyssey,\" but the literary references are often\ncoy, debatable, sarcastic, or disguised. For example, Homer's Odysseus,\nafter an epic 20-year-long journey, returns home to Ithaca\nand reunites with his faithful wife. In contrast, Joyce's Bloom\nwanders around Dublin for a day and returns home to his unfaithful wife. It's a very funny book. It has highbrow intellectual humor, if you have the patience to track down\nJoyce's references, and more lowbrow dirty jokes. Those, and other sexual references,\nwere too much for some. In the U.S., the book was put on trial,\nbanned, and censored before it had even been completed because it was originally published\nas a serial novel. Readers of \"Ulysses\" aren't just led\nthrough a variety of literary styles. They're also given a rich \nand shockingly accurate tour of a specific place at a time: Dublin in 1904. Joyce claimed that if Dublin\nwere to be destroyed, it could be recreated from the pages\nof this book. While such a claim is not exactly true, it does show the great care that Joyce\ntook in precisely representing details, both large and small, of his home city. No small feat considering he wrote\nthe entire novel while living outside \nof his native Ireland. It's a testament to Joyce's genius\nthat \"Ulysses\" is a difficult book. Some people find it impenetrable\nwithout a full book of annotations to help them understand what Joyce\nis even talking about. But there's a lot of joy to be found\nin reading it, more than just unpacking allusions\nand solving puzzles. And if it's difficult, \nor frustrating, or funny, that's because life is all that, and more. Responding to some criticism\nof \"Ulysses,\" and there was a lot \nwhen it was first published, Joyce said that if \"Ulysses\"\nisn't worth reading, then life isn't worth living."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Stephen Dedalus appears in which of Joyce’s other works?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dubliners"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exiles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chamber Music"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is Leopold Bloom’s job?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dentist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Concert singer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Traveling salesman"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Advertising canvasser"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which chapter is set like a play?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "9"}, {"label": "D", "text": "22"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "References to which famous Italian writer can be found in Ulysses?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Niccolò Machiavelli"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Giacomo Leopardi"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dante Alighieri"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gabriele D'Annunzio"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In what year is Ulysses set?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1904"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1914"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1922"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1882"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 30, "lesson": 3, "title": "What in the world is topological quantum matter? - Fan Zhang", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-in-the-world-is-topological-quantum-matter", "transcript": {"en": "What if electricity could travel forever\nwithout being diminished? What if a computer could run exponentially\nfaster with perfect accuracy? What technology could \nthose abilities build? We may be able to find out thanks \nto the work of the three scientists who won the Nobel Prize \nin Physics in 2016. David Thouless, Duncan Haldane, and Michael Kosterlitz won the award\nfor discovering that even microscopic matter\nat the smallest scale can exhibit macroscopic properties\nand phases that are topological. But what does that mean? First of all, topology is a branch\nof mathematics that focuses on fundamental properties\nof objects. Topological properties don't change when\nan object is gradually stretched or bent. The object has to be torn or attached\nin new places. A donut and a coffee cup look the same\nto a topologist because they both have one hole. You could reshape a donut \ninto a coffee cup and it would still have just one. That topological property is stable. On the other hand, \na pretzel has three holes. There are no smooth incremental changes\nthat will turn a donut into a pretzel. You'd have to tear two new holes. For a long time, it wasn't clear\nwhether topology was useful for describing the behaviors\nof subatomic particles. That's because particles,\nlike electrons and photons, are subject to the strange laws\nof quantum physics, which involve a great deal of uncertainty that we don't see \nat the scale of coffee cups. But the Nobel Laureates discovered\nthat topological properties do exist at the quantum level. And that discovery may revolutionize\nmaterials science, electronic engineering, and computer science. That's because these properties\nlend surprising stability and remarkable characteristics\nto some exotic phases of matter in the delicate quantum world. One example is called \na topological insulator. Imagine a film of electrons. If a strong enough magnetic field\npasses through them, each electron will start traveling\nin a circle, which is called\na closed orbit. Because the electrons are stuck\nin these loops, they're not conducting electricity. But at the edge of the material, the orbits become open, connected,\nand they all point in the same direction. So electrons can jump\nfrom one orbit to the next and travel all the way around the edge. This means that the material\nconducts electricity around the edge but not in the middle. Here's where topology comes in. This conductivity isn't affected\nby small changes in the material, like impurities or imperfections. That's just like how the hole\nin the coffee cup isn't changed by stretching it out. The edge of such a topological insulator\nhas perfect electron transport: no electrons travel backward, no energy is lost as heat, and the number of conducting pathways\ncan even be controlled. The electronics of the future \ncould be built to use this perfectly efficient\nelectron highway. The topological properties \nof subatomic particles could also transform quantum computing. Quantum computers \ntake advantage of the fact that subatomic particles can be \nin different states at the same time to store information in something\ncalled qubits. These qubits can solve problems\nexponentially faster than classical digital computers. The problem is that this data\nis so delicate that interaction with the environment\ncan destroy it. But in some exotic topological phases, the subatomic particles \ncan become protected. In other words, the qubits formed by them can't be changed by small \nor local disturbances. These topological qubits \nwould be more stable, leading to more accurate computation\nand a better quantum computer. Topology was originally studied as\na branch of purely abstract mathematics. Thanks to the pioneering work\nof Thouless, Haldane, and Kosterlitz, we now know it can be used to understand\nthe riddles of nature and to revolutionize \nthe future of technologies."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "David J.

{"page": 30, "lesson": 4, "title": "Why should you read Virgil's \"Aeneid\"? - Mark Robinson", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-virgil-s-aeneid-mark-robinson", "transcript": {"en": "In 19 B.C., the Roman poet Virgil\nwas traveling from Greece to Rome with the emperor Augustus. On the way, he stopped to go sightseeing\nin Megara, a town in Greece. Out in the sun for too long,\nhe suffered heatstroke and died on his journey back to Italy. On his deathbed, Virgil thought about the manuscript \nhe had been working on for over ten years, an epic poem that he called the \"Aeneid.\" Unsatisfied with the final edit,\nhe asked his friends to burn it, but they refused, and soon after Virgil's death,\nAugustus ordered it to be published. Why was Augustus so interested\nin saving Virgil's poem? The Romans had little tradition\nof writing serious literature and Virgil wanted to create a poem to rival the \"Iliad\"\nand \"Odyssey\" of Ancient Greece. The \"Aeneid,\" a 9,896 line poem,\nspans twelve separate sections, or books, the first six of which mirror\nthe structure of the \"Odyssey\" and the last six echo the \"Iliad.\" Also like the Greek epics, The \"Aeneid\" is written entirely\nin dactylic hexameter. In this meter, each line \nhas six syllable groups called feet made up of dactyls which go\nlong, short, short, and spondees which go long, long. So the famous opening line\nin the original Latin starts, \"Arma Virvmqve Cano,\" which can be translated as\n\"I sing of arms and the man,\" arms, meaning battles and warfare,\nanother \"Iliad\" reference, and the man being the hero Aeneas. To understand the \"Aeneid,\" it's necessary to examine the unsettled\nnature of Roman politics in the second half of the 1st century B.C. In 49 B.C., Julius Caesar, \nAugustus's great uncle, triggered nearly 20 years of civil war when he led his army \nagainst the Roman Republic. After introducing a dictatorship,\nhe was assassinated. Only after Augustus's victory\nover Marc Antony and Cleopatra in 31 B.C. did peace return to Rome and Augustus became the emperor. Virgil aimed to capture this sense\nof a new era and of the great sacrifices\nthat the Romans had endured. He wanted to give the Romans\na fresh sense of their origins, their past, and their potential. By connecting the founding of Rome to the mythological stories\nthat his audience knew so well, Virgil was able to link his hero Aeneas\nto the character of Augustus. In the epic poem, Aeneas is on a quest\nto establish a new home for his people. This duty, or pietas \nas the Romans called it, faces all kinds of obstacles. Aeneas risks destruction \nin the ruins of Troy, agonizes over love when he meets\nthe beautiful Queen of Carthage, Dido, and in one of the most vivid passages\nin all of ancient literature, has to pass through the underworld. On top of all that, he must then\nfight to win a homeland for his people around the future sight of Rome. Virgil presents Aeneas as a sort of model\nfor Augustus, and that's probably one of the reasons\nthe emperor was so eager to save the poem from destruction. But Virgil didn't stop there. In some sections, Aeneas even has visions\nof Rome's future and of Augustus himself. Virgil presents Augustus as a victor,\nentering Rome in triumph and shows him expanding \nthe Roman Empire. Perhaps most importantly, he's hailed as\nonly the third Roman leader in 700 years to shut the doors of the Temple of Janus\nsignifying the arrival of permanent peace. But there's a twist. Virgil only read Augustus three\nselected extracts of the story and that was Augustus's \nentire exposure to it. Some of the other sections\ncould be seen as critical, if not subtly subversive\nabout the emperor's achievements. Aeneas, again a model for Augustus,\nstruggles with his duty and often seems a reluctant hero. He doesn't always live up to the\nbehavior expected of a good Roman leader. He struggles to balance mercy and justice. By the end, the reader is left wondering\nabout the future of Rome and the new government of Augustus. Perhaps in wanting the story published, Augustus had been fooled\nby his own desire for self-promotion. As a result, Virgil's story has survived\nto ask questions about the nature of power\nand authority ever since."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How long had Virgil been writing the \"Aeneid\" when he died?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 year"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10 years"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which ancient country’s literature inspired Virgil’s writing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Egypt"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mesopotamia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Greece"}, {"label": "D", "text": "China"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who was the Roman emperor when Virgil was writing the \"Aeneid\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Julius Caesar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Augustus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nero"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mark Antony"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What sort of work is the \"Aeneid\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An epic poem"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A novel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A play"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A history book"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What does the Latin word pietas mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Skill"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Passion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Duty"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Strength"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Your target is a small island thousands\nof kilometers away in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. That's a body of water that covers\nmore than 160 million square kilometers, greater than all the landmasses \non Earth combined. For thousands of years, Polynesian navigators managed voyages \nlike this without the help \nof modern navigational aids. Ancient Polynesians used the Sun, Moon, stars, planets, ocean currents, and clouds as guides that allowed them\nto see the ocean as a series of pathways rather than an obstacle. Their voyages began around 1500 B.C. when the people who would settle Polynesia\nfirst set sail from Southeast Asia. Early Polynesians eventually settled\na vast area of islands spread over 40 million square kilometers\nof the Pacific Ocean. Some historians believe the voyagers moved\nfrom place to place to avoid overpopulation. Others, that they were driven by war. Voyages became less frequent\nby around 1300 A.D. as Polynesian societies became more rooted\nin specific locations. During the voyaging period, successful journeys depended on \na number of factors: well-built canoes, the skill of navigators, and weather being some of the biggest. Voyages relied on sturdy wa'a kaulua,\nor double-hulled canoes, which were powered by sails\nand steered with a single large oar. Canoe building involved\nthe whole community, bringing together the navigators, canoe builders, priests, chanters, and hula dancers. Navigators were keen observers \nof the natural world. They were abundantly familiar with \ntrade wind-generated ocean swells, which typically flow \nnortheast or southeast. By day, navigators could \nidentify direction by the rocking motion of their canoes\ncaused by these swells. But sunrise and sunset \nwere even more useful. The Sun's position indicated east and west and created low light on the ocean that\nmade it possible to see swells directly. At night, navigators used something \ncalled a star compass, which wasn't a physical object,\nbut rather a sort of mental map. They memorized the rising and setting\npoints of stars and constellations at different times of the year. They used those to divide the sky\ninto four quadrants, subdivided into 32 houses, with the canoe in the middle. So, for example, when they saw the star\nPira‘atea rising from the ocean, they knew that to be northeast. They had some other tricks, too. The Earth's axis points towards Hokupa'a,\nor the North Star, so called because it's the one fixed\npoint in the sky as the Earth rotates and always indicates north. However, it's not visible \nsouth of the Equator, so navigators there could use\na constellation called Newe, or the Southern Cross, and some mental tricks to estimate\nwhere south is. For instance, draw a line through\nthese two stars, extend it 4.5 times, and draw another line \nfrom there to the horizon. That's south. But the sky also contains \nnavigational aids much closer to Earth, the clouds. Besides being useful weather cues, under the right conditions, \nthey can indicate landmasses. For instance, the lagoons \nof Pacific atolls can actually be seen reflected\non the underside of clouds, if you know what to look for. And high masses of clouds can indicate\nmountainous islands. Once navigators neared their destination,\nother clues, such as the flight patterns of birds, floating debris or vegetation, and types of fish in the area helped\ndetermine the proximity of land. For example, the Manu-O-Ku had a known\nflight range of 190 kilometers, and could be followed back to shore. So how do we know all of this? Partially through evidence in petroglyphs, written observations \nof European explorers, and Polynesian oral traditions. But also by trying them out for ourselves. In 2017, a voyaging canoe called Hokulea completed a worldwide voyage \nusing only these techniques. If that seems remarkable,\nremember the ancient Polynesians, who through close study \nand kinship with nature, were able to forge these paths across an unfathomably vast, \nvibrant living ocean."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which item was not used by ancient Polynesian navigators?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sunset"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Star compass"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spyglass"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Flight patterns of birds"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Early Polynesian voyages took place from approximately:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2500 BC – 800 AD"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2000 BC – 1000 AD"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1500 BC – 1300 AD"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1000 BC – 1800 AD"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which is a good indicator of the proximity of land?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Zenith stars"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Types of fish caught"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ocean currents"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Temperature"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the most valued aspect in canoe building?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Enforcing the secrecy of building techniques"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The season of year when construction began"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Waterproofing the wood and materials"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The bringing together of the community"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How do we know that these ancient methods of wayfinding worked?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Written observations and oral traditions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Remnants of star compasses"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Computer models and simulations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ancient methods are purely speculative"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Over three nights, he'd look at and draw\nthe same set of stars, carefully measuring \ntheir relative positions. That night, he measured the stars. The next night, he measured them again. To his surprise, one had moved. The third night, the peculiar star\nhad moved again. This meant it couldn't be a star at all. It was something new, the first asteroid\never discovered, which Piazzi eventually named Ceres. Asteroids are bits of rock and metal\nthat orbit the Sun. At over 900 kilometers across,\nCeres is a very large asteroid. But through a telescope, like Piazzi's, Ceres looked like a pinpoint of light\nsimilar to a star. In fact, the word asteroid \nmeans star-like. You can tell the difference between stars and asteroids by \nthe way they move across the sky. Of course, Piazzi knew \nnone of that at the time, just that he had discovered something new. To learn about Ceres, Piazzi needed to track \nits motion across the sky and then calculate \nits orbit around the Sun. So each clear night, Piazzi\ntrained his telescope to the heavens. Night after night, \nhe made careful measurements until finally, he couldn't. The Sun got in the way. When Piazzi first spotted Ceres,\nit was here, and the Earth was here. As he tracked it each night,\nthe Earth and Ceres moved like this until Ceres was here. And that meant that Ceres was only\nin the sky when it was daytime on Earth. During the day, bright sunlight made \nthis small asteroid impossible to see. Astronomers needed to calculate\nCeres's orbit. This would let them predict where\nit was going to be in the vast night sky on any given night. But the calculations were grueling\nand the results imprecise. Many astronomers searched for Ceres, but not knowing exactly where to look,\nno one could find it. Luckily, a hardworking mathematician\nnamed Carl Friedrich Gauss heard about the lost asteroid. He thought it was an exciting puzzle\nand went to work. When he realized he didn't have\nthe mathematical methods he needed, he invented new ones \nthat we still use today. He derived a new orbit and new predictions\nof where to look for Ceres. Hungarian astronomer\nBaron Franz Xaver von Zach searched for Ceres \nwith Gauss's predictions. After weeks of frustrating clouds, von Zach finally had clear skies\non December 31, 1801. He looked through his telescope\nand finally saw Ceres. We haven't lost track of it since. Today, we've discovered hundreds\nof thousands of asteroids. Many, including Ceres, orbit the Sun\nbetween Mars and Jupiter, while near-Earth asteroids orbit\nthe Sun relatively close to Earth. When we recorded this narration, astronomers had discovered \n16,407 near-Earth asteroids, but since we find \nnew asteroids all the time, that number will have grown\nby hundreds or thousands by the time you watch this. Today, asteroid hunters \nuse modern telescopes, including one in space. Computers analyze the images, and humans check the output before reporting the asteroid observations\nto an archiving center. Each discovered asteroid has its unique\norbit measured. An orbit lets astronomers predict \nwhere asteroids are going to be at any given time. Most asteroid trajectories can be\npredicted for about 80 years though we can calculate where the best\nstudied asteroids will be every day between now and \n800 years into the future. We must keep searching for asteroids in case there's one out there\non a collision course with Earth. Astronomers don't only \nsearch for asteroids, though. They also study them \nto learn how they formed, what they're made of, and what they can tell us \nabout our solar system. Today, we can do something that Piazzi\ncould only dream of: send spacecraft to study \nasteroids up close. One spacecraft called Dawn\njourneyed billions of kilometers over four years to the main asteroid belt. There, it visited Ceres\nand another asteroid, Vesta. Dawn's stunning images transformed\nPiazzi's dot of light into a spectacular landscape\nof craters, landslides, and mountains."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In 1801, Piazzi stopped tracking Ceres because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "His telescope broke"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Sun got in the way"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It was too cloudy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "He got bored"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Modern asteroid hunters use:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Telescopes on the ground"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Telescopes in space"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Computers to analyze digital images"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Through telescopes on Earth, asteroids look like:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Complex worlds with craters, mountains, and landslides"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fuzzy disks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stars"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Trick question, you can’t see asteroids with telescopes on Earth"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "At the time this narration was recorded, how many near-Earth asteroids had been discovered?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Roughly 16"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Roughly 160"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Roughly 1600"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Roughly 16,000"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Looking through a telescope, you can distinguish between asteroids and stars:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By the way they move across the sky"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because stars look bigger than asteroids through a telescope"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Trick question, you can’t see asteroids with telescopes on Earth"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because all asteroids are green, and all stars are red"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

They were standing inside \na site of ancient art, the walls and roofs decorated with\nprehistoric paintings and engravings, ranging from 19,000 to 35,000 years old. Similar marks of our ancestors have been\npreserved in caves all over the world. The oldest we've found were made up to\n40,000 years ago. What do these images tell us\nabout the ancient human mind and the lives of their creators? These early artists mixed minerals, clay,\ncharcoal, and ochre with spit or animal fat to create paint. They drew with their hands and tools,\nlike pads of moss, twigs, bones, and hair. In many instances, their images follow\nthe contours of the cave to create depth and shade. The most common depictions\nare of geometric shapes, followed by large mammals, like bison,\nhorses, mammoths, deer, and boars. Human figures appear rarely,\nas well as occasional hand prints. Some have theorized that these artworks\nare the creation of hunters, or of holy men in trance-like states. And we've found examples created by\nmen, women, and even children. And why did they create this art? Perhaps they were documenting \nwhat they knew about the natural world, like modern scientists, or marking their tribal territory. Maybe the images were the culmination\nof sacred hunting rituals or spiritual journeys. Or could they be art for art's sake,\nthe sheer joy and fulfillment of creation?

But while the answers remain elusive, these images are our earliest proof\nof human communication, testifying to the human capacity \nfor creativity thousands of years before writing.

We've harnessed electricity, sequenced the human genome, and eradicated small pox. But after billions of dollars in research, we haven't found a solution for a disease\nthat affects more than 14 million people and their families at any given time. Cancer arises as normal cells\naccumulate mutations. Most of the time, \ncells can detect mutations or DNA damage and either fix them or self destruct. However, some mutations allow cancerous\ncells to grow unchecked and invade nearby tissues, or even metastasize to distant organs. Cancers become almost incurable\nonce they metastasize. And cancer is incredibly complex. It's not just one disease. There are more than 100 different types and we don't have a magic bullet\nthat can cure all of them. For most cancers, treatments usually include \na combination of surgery to remove tumors and radiation and chemotherapy\nto kill any cancerous cells left behind. Hormone therapies, immunotherapy, and targeted treatments tailored\nfor a specific type of cancer are sometimes used, too. In many cases, \nthese treatments are effective and the patient becomes cancer-free. But they're very far from 100% effective\n100% of the time. So what would we have to do to find cures\nfor all the different forms of cancer? We're beginning to understand a few\nof the problems scientists would have to solve. First of all, we need new, better ways\nof studying cancer. Most cancer treatments are developed\nusing cell lines grown in labs from cultures of human tumors. These cultured cells have given us\ncritical insights about cancer genetics and biology, but they lack much of the complexity\nof a tumor in an actual living organism. It's frequently the case that new drugs,\nwhich work on these lab-grown cells, will fail in clinical trials \nwith real patients. One of the complexities \nof aggressive tumors is that they can have multiple populations\nof slightly different cancerous cells. Over time, distinct genetic mutations\naccumulate in cells in different parts of the tumor,\ngiving rise to unique subclones. For example, aggressive brain tumors\ncalled glioblastomas can have as many as six different \nsubclones in a single patient. This is called clonal heterogeneity, and it makes treatment difficult because\na drug that works on one subclone may have no effect on another. Here's another challenge. A tumor is a dynamic \ninterconnected ecosystem where cancer cells constantly \ncommunicate with each other and with healthy cells nearby. They can induce normal cells to form\nblood vessels that feed the tumor and remove waste products. They can also interact \nwith the immune system to actually suppress its function, keeping it from recognizing \nor destroying the cancer. If we could learn how to shut down\nthese lines of communication, we'd have a better shot at vanquishing \na tumor permanently. Additionally, mounting evidence suggests we'll need to figure out how to eradicate\ncancer stem cells. These are rare but seem \nto have special properties that make them resistant \nto chemotherapy and radiation. In theory, even if the rest of the tumor\nshrinks beyond detection during treatment, a single residual cancer stem cell\ncould seed the growth of a new tumor. Figuring out how to target\nthese stubborn cells might help prevent cancers \nfrom coming back. Even if we solved those problems,\nwe might face new ones. Cancer cells are masters of adaptation, adjusting their molecular and cellular\ncharacteristics to survive under stress. When they're bombarded by radiation\nor chemotherapy, some cancer cells can effectively\nswitch on protective shields against whatever's attacking them\nby changing their gene expression. Malignant cancers are complex systems\nthat constantly evolve and adapt. To defeat them, we need to find\nexperimental systems that match their complexity, and monitoring and treatment options\nthat can adjust as the cancer changes. But the good news is \nwe're making progress. Even with all we don't know, the average mortality rate \nfor most kinds of cancer has dropped significantly since the 1970s\nand is still falling. We're learning more every day, and each new piece of information gives\nus one more tool to add to our arsenal."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Mutation in cells always results in cancerous cells.

Can our knowledge and history survive? The printed page will decompose. Hard drive storage will deteriorate. Even stones will eventually crumble. But we might have something inside us that\ncan outlast these physical limitations: deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA already stores \nour biological information. From eye color to skin tone,\nit programs our entire bodies. DNA is made of four organic bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, or A, G, C, and T. The specific sequence of these bases\ninto groups of three, known as codons, gives our cells instructions to make\neach of the proteins in our bodies. But this code can \nbe used for other things, too, like secret messages. In 1999, scientists in New York\ncreated an alphabet in which each of the 64 \npossible DNA codons substituted for a specific letter,\nnumber, or grammar symbol. They spliced a 22-character message\ninto a long strand of DNA and surrounded it with specific\ngenetic markers. They then hid the DNA over a period\nin a type-written letter with only a small smudge\nto give the location away. They mailed the letter back to themselves. Then they examined the letter\nlooking for the DNA strand. Once the DNA strand was located,\nthey found the genetic markers. Then, they sequenced the DNA\nand successfully decoded the message. It soon became obvious \nthat DNA cryptography could code for much more\nthan simple text. By translating the 1's and 0's\nof binary code into DNA codons, digital data could be programmed\ninto synthetic DNA, then decoded back into its original form. In 2012, UK scientists encoded\n739 kilobytes of computer files into DNA strands, including all 154 Shakespeare sonnets and an excerpt from Martin \nLuther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech. And four years later, researchers at\nMicrosoft and the University of Washington broke that record. They used binary coding to capture\na whopping 200 megabytes of data, including the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights and a high-def OK Go music video, all in strings of DNA. As far as storage capacity goes, DNA stands out because of the surprising\namount of information it can hold in so little space. The current theoretical limit \nof DNA'S storage capacity is so high that you could fit 100 million HD movies\non a pencil eraser. It's even conceivable that one day\nwe could fit all of the information currently on the Internet into the space of a shoe box. Also, computers and the magnetic tape and\ndiscs that their information is stored on only last for a few decades, at most,\nbefore degrading and becoming unreliable. Meanwhile, DNA \nhas a half-life of 500 years, meaning that's how long it takes\nfor half of its bonds to break. And if left in a cold \nand dark environment, DNA could potentially last\nfor hundreds of thousands of years. And if that isn't long enough, scientists experimented with having\nsynthetic DNA auto-reproduce. After creating their own strands of DNA that spelled out the lyrics to\nthe children's song \"It's a Small World,\" they placed them into the genome of\na microbe nicknamed Conan the Bacterium. Conan belongs to a species \nwhich can survive in a vacuum, or without water, for six years, or come out unscathed after being\nexposed to a dose of radiation 1,000 times that which would kill a human. According to the experiment, the bacterium was able to reproduce at\nleast 100 generations without data loss. Theoretically, if the organism\nhad redundant copies of the information that could be used to automatically\ncorrect mistakes, the information could stay\npreserved even longer. So one day, you might be able to create\na living, growing, knowledge archive in your own backyard, and its seeds might carry\nyour family's history, a detailed breakdown \nof the world's political upheavals, or the sum of humanity's knowledge\ninto forests and across continents. Perhaps even into the \nfar reaches of space.

just an ordinary saturday my dad was outside mowing the lawn my mom was upstairs folding laundry my sister was in a room doing homework and i was in the basement playing video games and as i came upstairs to get something to drink i looked out the window and realized that there was something that i was supposed to be doing and this is what i saw no this wasn't my family's dinner on fire this was my science project flames were pouring out smoke was in the air and it looked like a wooden deck was about to catch fire i immediately started yelling my mom was freaking out my dad ran around to put out the fire and of course my sister started recording a snapchat video this was just the beginning of my team's science project my team is composed of me and three other students who are here in the audience today we competed in first lego league which is an international lego robotics competition for kids and in addition to a robotics game we also worked on a separate science project and this was the project that we were working on so the idea for this project all started when a few months earlier a couple of my teammates took a trip to central america and saw beaches littered with styrofoam or expanded polystyrene foam and when they came back and told us about it we really started thinking about the ways in which we see styrofoam every day get a new flat screen tv you end up with a block of styrofoam bigger than the tv itself drink a cup of coffee or those styrofoam coffee cups are sure going to add up and where do all these items go after their one time use since there aren't any good existing solutions for use styrofoam almost all of them end up right in the landfill or the oceans and beaches taking over 500 years to degrade and in fact every year the u.s alone produces over 2 billion pounds of styrofoam filling up a staggering 25 percent of landfills so why do we have these gross accumulations of styrofoam waste why can't we just recycle them like many plastics well simply put recycled polystyrene is too expensive and potentially contaminated so there is very little market demand for styrofoam that has to be recycled and as a result styrofoam is considered a non-renewable material because it is neither feasible nor viable to recycle polystyrene and in fact many cities across the us have even passed ordinances that simply banned the production of many products containing polystyrene which includes disposable utensils packing peanuts takeout containers and even plastic beach toys all products that are very useful in today's society and now france has become the first country to completely ban all plastic utensils cups and plates but what if we could keep using styrofoam and keep benefiting from its cheap lightweight insulating an excellent packing ability while not having to suffer from the repercussions of having to dispose of it what if we could turn it into something else that's actually useful what if we can make the impossible possible my team hypothesized that we could use the carbon that is already in styrofoam to create activated carbon which is used in almost every water filter today an activated carbon works by using very small micro pores to filter out contaminants from water or even air so we started out by doing a variety of heating tests and unfortunately we had many failures literally nothing worked besides my dad's grow kitchen on fire most of her samples vaporized into nothing or exploded inside expensive furnaces leaving a horribly sticky mess in fact we were so saddened by our failures that we almost gave up so why did we keep trying when all the adults said it was impossible well maybe it's because we're kids we don't know any better but the truth is we kept trying because we thought it was still possible we knew that if we were successful we would be helping the environment and making the world a better place so we kept trying and failing and trying and failing we were so ready to give up but then it happened with the right temperatures times and chemicals we finally got that successful test result showing us that we had created activity carbon from styrofoam waste and at that moment the thing that had been impossible all of a sudden wasn't it showed us that although we had many failures at the beginning we were able to persevere through them to get the test results that we wanted and moreover not only were we able to create activated carbon for purifying water but we were also able to reduce styrofoam waste solving two global problems with just one solution so from then on we were inspired to take our project further performing more tests to make it more effective and testing it in real-world situations we then proceeded to receive funding from the nsta's e-cyber mission stem and action program sponsored by the us army as well as first global innovation awards sponsored by xprize and we were also honored with the site with the scientific american innovator award from google science fair and using these funds we plan to file a full patent on our process and to continue to work on our project so yes although we started with feeling with catching my dad's grill on fire and failing so many times that we almost quit it was well worth it when we look back in it now we took a problem that many people said was impossible and we made it possible and we persevered when it looked like nothing that we did would work we learned that you can't have success without a little or a lot of failure so in the future don't be afraid if your girl goes up in flames because you never know when your idea might just catch fire thank you"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 30, "lesson": 11, "title": "How aspirin was discovered - Krishna Sudhir", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-aspirin-was-discovered-krishna-sudhir", "transcript": {"en": "4,000 years ago, the ancient Sumerians\nmade a surprising discovery. If they scraped the bark \noff a particular kind of tree and ate it, their pain disappeared. Little did they know that why they'd found was destined to influence \nthe future course of medicine. What the Sumerians had discovered was\na precursor to the medicine known today as aspirin. Aspirin's active ingredient is found\ncommonly in willow trees and other wild plants, which is how it came to infuse\nthe medical traditions of Sumer, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and other cultures. Around 400 BC, Hippocrates, thought \nof as the father of modern medicine, first recommended chewing willow bark\nfor pain relief and making willow leaf tea\nto ease the pain of childbirth. But it took over 2,000 years for us to\ncomprehensively investigate its potential. In the mid-18th century, an Englishman named Edward Stone\nran five years of experiments, showing that willow bark crushed\ninto a powder and eaten could cure a fever. It took nearly another 70 years\nfor a German pharmacist, Johann Buchner, to finally identify and purify\nthe substance that made all this possible, a compound called salicin. By then, doctors were routinely\nusing willow bark and other salicin-rich plants,\nlike the herb meadowsweet, to ease pain, fever, and inflammation. But identifying the exact compound\nsuddenly opened up the possibility of manipulating its form. In 1853, a French chemist managed\nto chemically synthesize the compound, creating a substance called\nacetylsalicylic acid. Then in 1897, the pharmaceutical company\nBayer found a new method and began marketing the compound\nas a pain reliever called aspirin. This was widely recognized as one of\nthe first synthetic pharmaceutical drugs. Originally, aspirin was \njust Bayer's brand name: A for acetyl, and spir for meadowsweet, whose botanical name is\nSpiraea ulmaria. Soon, aspirin became synonymous with\nacetylsalicylic acid. As its influence grew, aspirin was found\nto ease not just pain, but also many \ninflammation-related problems, like rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, which enflames \nthe fluid-filled sack around the heart, and Kawasaki disease, where blood vessels become inflamed. Yet, despite aspirin's medical value, at this point, scientists still didn't\nactually know how it worked. In the 1960s and 70s, Swedish \nand British scientists changed that. They showed that the drug interrupts\nthe production of certain chemicals called prostaglandins, which control the transmission \nof pain sensations and inflammation. In 1982, that discovery won \nthe researchers a Nobel Prize in Medicine. Over time, research has also uncovered\naspirin's risks. Overconsumption can cause bleeding\nin the intestines and the brain. It can also trigger Reye's Syndrome, a rare but often fatal illness\nthat affects the brain and liver in children with an infection. And in the late 20th century, aspirin's success had been overshadowed\nby newer pain killers with fewer side effects, like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. But in the 1980s, further discoveries\nabout aspirin's benefits revived interest in it. In fact, the 1982 Nobel Prize winners \nalso demonstrated that aspirin slows production \nof thromboxanes, chemicals that cause clumping\nof platelets, which in turn form blood clots. A landmark clinical trial showed that\naspirin reduced heart attack risk by 44% in participants who took the drug. Today, we prescribe it to people\nat risk of heart attack or stroke because it cuts the likelihood of clots\nforming in the arteries that supply the heart and brain. Even more intriguingly, there's a growing body of research\nthat suggests aspirin reduces the risk of getting\nand dying from cancer, especially colorectal cancer. This might be due to aspirin's \nanti-platelet effects. By reducing platelet activity, aspirin may\ndecrease the levels of a certain protein that helps cancer cells spread. These discoveries have transformed aspirin\nfrom a mere pain reliever to a potentially life-saving treatment.

But that doesn’t mean knew how to solve it. It took him a few moths  to figure\nit out. By the time the first World Rubik’s Cube\nChampionships were held in 1982, The winner -- he could solve the cube in a\nlittle less than 23 seconds. And these days?\n[news montage of collin’s record] This is world record holder Collin Burns, and\ntoday, we find out how he did it. [TITLES] “It could last another day; it could last\nanother few years. The previous record lasted for just over 2 years. But with single solve,\nespecially, you just need to get lucky. Or at least that’s a big part of it.” Collin tends to downplay his skills but it’s\nworth noting there are two types of world records.\nThe way speedcubing competitions work is that volunteers scramble the cubes according to\ninstructions that are generated by a computer, so competitors all get the same scramble. They do 5 solves and their three middle scores\nare averaged. So Collin holds the world record for a single\nsolve. But the world record for an average score\nis held by a 19-year-old in Australia. Still, Collin’s record is a huge deal. At\nthe competition where we met up with him, kids were asking him for his autograph. He’s now being sponsored by a cube company\nand by a cube retailer, which are paying for him to travel internationally. And he wants\npeople to know, you could do this too. “The biggest misconception about cubing\nis that it’s difficult, which it really isn’t.”\nPop culture treats the Rubik’s cube like some sort of IQ test, but it’s not. At least\nnot anymore. “Generally average is much more impressive\nbecause you have to be consistently fast.” Still, Collin’s record is a huge deal. At\nthe competition where we met up with him, other kids were asking him for autographs.\n“are you that famous cube guy?” I recently bought a cube online and it came\nwith instructions for beginners. And if you memorize those, you can solve the cube in\na couple minutes. It helps to understand the design of the puzzle.\nAt first glance, it looks like a cube made out of cubes — right, three layers of nine. But if you look closer, you’ll see there\naren’t actually any cubes here. So that tells you that the corners will always be\ncorners, the edges will always be edges, and the middle pieces determine the color of that\nface. Speedcubers will buy special cubes. They can\nlubricate them and adjust the tension. But the real key to their speed is efficiency\n- they’re looking several moves ahead, and they use fewer moves to get the same result. So there are 43 quintillion possible arrangements\nfor the cube. A few years back, some researchers borrowed\ncomputing power from Google to find out that any scramble can be solved in 20 moves or\nless. They call it God’s Number. But humans just aren’t that good. The beginners’ method that I learned uses\n100 to 200 moves. Speedcubers use more around 50 to 60 moves.\nAnd they can do that, in part, because of the knowledge gained by the previous generation\nof speedcubers. When the cube first spread around the world\nback in the 80s, people had to learn through trial and error. This was happening in a lot of math departments\nand campus clubs. People were discovering the cube at the same time, and they were sharing\nwhat they learned. The method Collin uses was developed by Jessica\nFridrich, an engineering professor who was a college student at the time. It starts with a cross on one of the faces.\nAnd that face becomes the bottom layer. Then what they do is solve the corners of the bottom\nlayer and the middle layer simultaneously. “So, now you can see that all of this is\nsolved.” And for the final layer, they’re choosing\nfrom dozens of algorithms that they’ve memorized. And those are sequences of moves that mess\nup the cube temporarily to move certain pieces into place. And then put the rest of the cube\nback where it was. The Rubik’s cube has made a comeback in\nrecent years along with that same ethic of sharing tips and strategies. So all the resources you need are there, there’s\njust one other thing. Practice! This is Collin nearly 5 years ago. world records\nare not built in a day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Any scramble can be solved in ___ moves or less.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "20"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1,000"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

[Music] allow me to uh to start this talk with a question to everyone you know that all over the world people fight for their freedom fight for the rights some battle oppressive governments others battle oppressive societies which battle do you think is harder allow me to try to answer this question in the few coming minutes let me take you back two years ago in my life it was the big time of my son agbudi he was five at the time after finishing his bedtime rituals he looked at me and he asked a question mommy are we bad people i was shocked why do you say such thing a booty earlier that day i noticed some bruises on his face when he came from school he wouldn't tell me what happened he was ready to tell two boys hit me today in school they told me we saw your mom on facebook you and your mom should be put in jail i've never been afraid to tell a buddhi anything i've been always a proud woman of my achievements but those questioning eyes of my son were my moment of truth when it all came together you see a massage woman who'd been put to jail for driving a car in a country where women are not supposed to drive cars just for giving me his car keys my own brother was detained twice and he was harassed to the point he had to quit his job as a geologist leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son my father had to sit in a friday sermon listening to the imam condemning condemning women drivers and calling them prostitutes amongst tens of worshippers some of them are friends and family of my own father i was faced with organized defamation campaign in the local media combined with false rumors shared a lot in family gatherings in the streets and in school it all hit me it came into focus that those kids were not meant to be rude to my son they were just influenced by the adults around them and it wasn't about me and it wasn't a punishment for taking the wheel and driving a few miles it was a punishment for daring to challenge the society's rules but my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine allow me to give you a very briefing about my story it was may 2011 and i was complaining to a work colleague about the harassments i had to face trying to find a ride back home although i have a car an international driver's license as long as i know women in saudi arabia have been always complaining about the ban but it's been 20 years since anyone tried to do anything about it a whole generation ago he broke the bad news in my face but there is no law banning you from driving i looked it up and he was right there was an actual law in saudi arabia it was just a custom and traditions that are enshrined in rigid religious faith words and imposed on women that realization ignited the idea of june 17 where we encouraged women to take the wheel and go drive it was few weeks later we started receiving all these men walls with rabies if you go and drive a courageous woman her name is najla hariri she's a saudi woman in the city of vegeta she drove a car and she announced but she didn't record the video we needed proof so i drove i posted a video on youtube and for my surprise it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day what happened next of course i started receiving threats to be killed raped just to stop this campaign the saudi authorities remained very quiet that really creeped us out i was in the campaign with other saudi women and even men activists we wanted to know how the authorities will respond on the actual day june 17 with women go out and drive so this time i asked my brother to come with me and drive by a police car it went fast we were arrested signed a pledge not to drive again released arrested again he was sent to detention for one day and i was sent to jail i wasn't sure why i was sent there because i didn't face any charges in the interrogation but what i was sure of of my innocence i didn't break a law and i kept my abia it's a black clock we were in saudi arabia before we leave the house and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off but i was so sure of my innocence i kept saying no i'm leaving today outside the jail the whole country went into a frenzy some attacking me badly and others supportive and even collecting signatures for in a petition to be sent to the king to release me i was released after nine days june 17 comes the the streets were packed with police cars and religious police cars but some hundred brave saudi women broke the ban and drove that day none were arrested we broke the tabo so i think by now everyone knows that we can drive or women i'm not allowed to drive in saudi arabia but maybe few knows why allow me to help you answer this question there was this official study that was presented to the shura council it's the consultative council appointed by the king in saudi arabia and it was done by a local professor a university professor he claims it's done based on a unesco study and the study states the percentage of rape adultery illegitimate children even drug abuse prostitution and countries with women drive is higher than countries would wind and drive i know i was like this i was shocked i was like we are the last country in ward where women don't drive so if you look at the map of the world that only leaves two countries saudi arabia and the other society is the rest of the world we started a hashtag on twitter mocking the study and he made headlines around the world and only then we realized it's so empowering to mock your oppressor it strips it away of his strongest weapon fear this system is based on ultra conservative traditions and customs deal with moment as they are inferior and they need a guardian to protect them so they need to take permission from this garden with it verbal or written all their lives were minors until the day we die and it becomes worse when is enshrined in religious fatwas based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law or the religious laws what's worse when they become codified as laws in the system and when women themselves believe in their infinity and they even fight those who try to question these rules so for me it wasn't only about these attacks i had to face it was about living two totally different perception of my personality of my person the villain back in my home country and the hero outside just to tell you uh two stories happened in the last two years one of them is when i was in jail i'm pretty sure when i was in jail everyone so titles in the international media something like this during these nine days i was in jail but in my home country it was totally different picture it was more like this manager faces charges of disturbing public order and inciting women to drive i know manal sharif withdraws from the campaign ah it's okay this is my favorite managerial breaks down and confuses foreign forces inside me and it goes on even trial and flogging me in public so i started a different picture i was asked last year to give a speech in also freedom forum i was surrounded by this love and support of people around me and they looked at me as an inspiration the same time i flew back to my home country they hated their speech so much the way they called it a betrayal to the saudi country and the saudi people and they even started a hashtag called oslo traitor on twitter some 10 000 tweets were written in that hashtag while the opposite hashtag oslo hero there was like a handful of tweets written they even started a poll more than 13 000 voters answered this poll whether they considered me trader or not after that speech 90 said yes she's a trader so it's these two totally different perception of my personality for me i'm a proud saudi woman and i do love my country and because i love my country i'm doing this because i believe a society will not be free if women of that society are not thank free thank you thank you [Music] thank you but you learn lessons from these things that happen to you i learned to be always there the first thing i got out of jail of course after i took a shower i went online i opened my twitter account on my facebook page and i've been always very respectful to those people who are open it to me i would listen to what they say i would never defend myself with act with words only i would use actions when they said i withdraw from the campaign i filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate of traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license there are a lot of people also very big supporters like those 3 000 people who signed the petition to release me like the we sent a petition to the shura council in favor of lifting the ban on saudi women and there were like 3 500 citizens believes in that and they signed that petition there are people like that i just showed some sample who are amazing who are believing in women's rights in saudi arabia and trying and they're also facing a lot of hate because of speaking up and voicing their views saudi arabia today is taking small steps toward enhancing women's right the shura council that's appointed by the king by royal decree king abdullah last year there were 30 women assigned to that council like 20 percent 20 of the council the same time finally that council after rejecting our petition four times for roman driving they finally accepted it last february after being sent to jail or sentenced lashing or sent to a trial the spokesperson of the traffic police said we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers the grand mufti who is the head of the religious establishment in saudi arabia he said it's not recommended for a woman to drive it used to be haram forbidden by the previous grand mufti so for me it's not about only these small steps it's about women themselves a friend once asked me she said so what do you think this woman driving will happen i told her only if women stop asking when and take action to make it now so it's not only about the system it's also about us women to drive our own life i'd say so i have no clue really how i become an activist and i don't know how i became one now but all i know and all i'm sure of in the future when someone asked him ask me my story i will say i'm proud to be amongst those women who lived the band for the bad and celebrated everyone's freedom so the question i started my talk with who do you think is more difficult to face oppressive governments or oppressive societies i hope you find clues to answer that from my speech thank you everyone thank you [Music] you"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Too many of his patients were complaining\nof severe abdominal pain due to stomach ulcers, which are sores in the lining\nof the upper intestinal tract. At the time, few effective treatments\nfor ulcers existed, and many sufferers required\nhospitalization or even surgery. Desperate for answers, Dr. Marshall swallowed a cloudy\nbroth of bacteria collected from the stomach\nof one of his patients. Soon, Dr. Marshall was experiencing\nthe same abdominal pain, bloating, and vomiting. Ten days later, a camera called \nan endoscope peered inside his insides. Marshall's stomach was teeming\nwith the same bacteria as his patient. He'd also developed gastritis,\nor severe inflammation of the stomach, the hallmark precursor of ulcers. Dr. Marshall's idea challenged a misconception \nthat still persists to this day: that ulcers are caused by stress, food, or too much stomach acid. Marshall thought the culprit\nwas bacterial infections. Initially, his idea was considered crazy by the brightest medical \nminds on the planet. But in 2005, he and Dr. Robin Warren\nreceived the ultimate validation when they were awarded the Nobel\nPrize for medicine. Our stomachs are J-shaped organs\nwith surprisingly intricate ecosystems awash in hormones and chemicals. The stomach is under constant attack\nby digestive enzymes, bile, proteins, microbes, and the stomach's own acid. In response, it produces bicarbonate, mucus, and phospholipids called prostaglandins to maintain the integrity\nof its own lining. This delicate balance is constantly\nregulated and referred to as mucosal defense. Since the mid-1800s, doctors thought\nstress alone caused most stomach ulcers. Patients were given antidepressants\nor tranquilizers and told to visit health spas. This belief eventually shifted\nto the related notion of spicy foods and stress as culprits. Yet no convincing study has ever\ndemonstrated that emotional upset, psychological distress, or spicy food directly causes ulcer disease. By the mid-20th century, it was widely\naccepted that excess hydrochloric acid prompted the stomach to eat itself. Fervent proponents of this idea\nwere referred to as the acid mafia. The biggest hole in this theory\nwas that antiacids only provide temporary relief. We now know that some rare ulcers are indeed caused \nby too much hydrochloric acid. But they make up less than 1%\nof all cases. Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren pinpointed\na spiral-shaped bacteria called Helicobacter pylori,\nor H. pylori, as the real offender. H. pylori is one of humanity's oldest\nand most frequent companions, having joined us at least 50,000\nyears ago, and now found in 50% of people. Previously, we thought the stomach\nwas sterile on account of it being such an acidic,\nhostile environment. Yet H. pylori survives the acidic turmoil\nof the stomach with a variety of features that disrupt\nmucosal defense in its favor. For example, it produces an enzyme\ncalled urease that helps protect it from \nthe surrounding gastric acid. H. pylori can make over 1,500 proteins, many of which are dedicated to maximizing\nits virulence. We still have unanswered questions, like why specific people develop ulcers\nat particular times. However, we do know individual genetics, other medical problems, use of certain medications, smoking, and the genetic diversity \nof Helicobacter strains all play a role. In particular, certain pain medications\nused to reduce inflammation in joints have been discovered to work\nwith H. pylori to create more severe stomach ulcers. Dr. Marshall ended up being fine after\nhis famous, albeit dangerous, experiment. He ingested a course of antibiotics\nsimilar to the ones taken now for ulcers. To be treated by simple antibiotics\nis a modern triumph for a disease that previously \nneeded surgery. Marshall's work also reminded us that\nscientific progress is not always smooth. But there's value in trusting \nyour proverbial, and sometimes literal, gut."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Prior to the discovery of Helicobacter pylori, which of the following were considered causes of peptic ulcers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spicy foods"}, {"label": "B", "text": "High stress lifestyles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Anxious dispositions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "High acid levels"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "In the context of peptic ulcer disease, mucosal defense refers to which concept?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The interplay of structural and chemical factors that maintain the integrity and appropriate functioning of the lining of the stomach"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The numerous immune cells that are use to disrupt the protein shell of Helicobacter pylori"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The intra-cellular inflammatory cascade that emerges to minimize the noxious effects of an ulcer once it has formed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The dramatic rise in base levels to counteract the corrosive effects of excess stomach acid"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Approximately how much of the world’s population has Helicobacter pylori?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "35%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "E", "text": "65%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which is the primary acid in the stomach?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sulfuric acid (H2SO4)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chloric acid (HClO3)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hydrochloric acid (HCL)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hydrochloric acid (HCL) and acetic acid (CH3COOH)"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Percarbonic acid (H2CO4)"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following factors most influences when Helicobacter pylori prompts the development of ulcers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Exposure to environmental toxins such as secondhand smoke"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Use of certain medications such as non-steroidal pain medications (NSAIDs)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Variations in the shape of people’s stomach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Low antioxidant intake in diet"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Prior use of acid suppressing medications"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Waiting for them are teams\nof lab workers who capture the horseshoe crabs\nby the hundreds of thousands, take them to labs, harvest their cerulean blood, then return them to the sea. Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs\non the beach because that's the only place\nwe know we can find them. A female horseshoe crab lays as many\nas 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs on her annual visit to the beach. When the eggs hatch, the juvenile horseshoe crabs\noften stay near shore, periodically shedding their shells\nas they grow. Once they leave \nthese shallow waters, they don't return until they\nreach sexual maturity ten years later. Despite our best efforts, we don't\nknow where they spend those years. Though we've spotted the occasional \nhorseshoe crab as deep as 200 meters below\nthe ocean's surface, we only see large groups of adults\nwhen they come ashore to spawn. Horseshoe crab blood contains\ncells called amebocytes that protect them \nfrom infection by viruses, fungi, and bacteria. Amebocytes form gels around\nthese invaders to prevent them from spreading infections. This isn't unusual. All animals have protective \nimmune systems. But horseshoe crab amebocytes\nare exceptionally sensitive to bacterial endotoxins. Endotoxins are molecules\nfrom the cell walls of certain bacteria, including E. coli. Large amounts of them are released\nwhen bacterial cells die, and they can make us sick\nif they enter the blood stream. Many of the medicines and medical devices\nwe rely on can become contaminated, so we have to test them\nbefore they touch our blood. We do have tests called Gram stains\nthat detect bacteria, but they can't recognize endotoxins which can be there even when\nbacteria aren't present. So scientists use an extract called LAL produced from harvested \nhorseshoe crab blood to test for endotoxins. They add LAL to a medicine sample,\nand if gels form, bacterial endotoxins are present. Today, the LAL test is used so widely that millions of people who've\nnever seen a horseshoe crab have been protected by their blood. If you've ever had an injection,\nthat probably includes you. How did horseshoe crabs end up\nwith such special blood? Like other invertebrates, the horseshoe crab has an open\ncirculatory system. This means their blood isn't contained\nin blood vessels, like ours. Instead, horseshoe crab blood\nflows freely through the body cavity and comes in direct contact with tissues. If bacteria enters their blood,\nit can quickly spread over a large area. Pair this vulnerability with the horseshoe crab's bacteria-filled \nocean and shoreline habitats, and it's easy to see why they need\nsuch a sensitive immune response. Horseshoe crabs survived \nmass extinction events that wiped out over 90% of life on Earth\nand killed off the dinosaurs, but they're not invincible. And the biggest disruptions they've faced\nin millions of years come from us. Studies have shown that up to\n15% of horseshoe crabs die in the process of having\ntheir blood harvested. And recent research suggests\nthis number may be even higher. Researchers have also observed\nfewer females returning to spawn at some of the most harvested areas. Our impact on horseshoe crabs extends\nbeyond the biomedical industry, too. Coastal development \ndestroys spawning sites, and horseshoe crabs are also\nkilled for fishing bait. There's ample evidence that\ntheir populations are shrinking. Some researchers have started working to synthesize horseshoe crab \nblood in the lab. For now, we're unlikely to stop\nour beach trips, but hopefully, a synthetic alternative\nwill someday eliminate our reliance on the blood of these ancient creatures."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where do adult horseshoe crabs live?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "On the beach"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the shallows"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In the deep sea"}, {"label": "D", "text": "We don’t know for sure"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "We use amebocytes from horseshoe crab blood to test for:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Viruses"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bacteria"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bacterial endotoxins"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fungi"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Bacteria and bacterial endotoxins"}, {"label": "F", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "LAL reveals the presence of contaminants by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Forming gels"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Changing color"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Changing temperature"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Developing a grainy texture"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Horseshoe crabs have which of the following?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A closed circulatory system"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An open circulatory system"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Veins"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An open circulatory system and veins"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What percentage of horseshoe crabs die while having their blood harvested?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5% or less"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Estimates vary from 25% to 75%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Studies show about 15%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "40%"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Inside our homes, \nmost vacuum cleaners work by using a fan to create a low-pressure\nrelatively empty area that sucks matter in to fill the void. But that's far from empty. There's still plenty of matter\nbouncing around. Manufacturers rely on more thorough,\nsealed vacuums for all sorts of purposes. That includes vacuum-packed food\nthat stays fresh longer, and the vacuums inside early light bulbs\nthat protected filaments from degrading. These vacuums are generally created\nwith some version of what a vacuum cleaner does using high-powered pumps that create\nenough suction to remove as many stray atoms as possible. But the best of these industrial processes tends to leave hundreds \nof millions of atoms per cubic centimeter of space. That isn't empty enough\nfor scientists who work on experiments, like the Large Hadron Collider, where particle beams need to circulate\nat close to the speed of light for up to ten hours without hitting\nany stray atoms. So how do they create a vacuum? The LHC's pipes are made of materials,\nlike stainless steel, that don't release any \nof their own molecules and are lined with a special coating\nto absorb stray gases. Raising the temperature \nto 200 degrees Celsius burns off any moisture, and hundreds of vacuum pumps take\ntwo weeks to trap enough gas and debris out of the pipes for the collider's\nincredibly sensitive experiments. Even with all this, the Large Hadron Collider\nisn't a perfect vacuum. In the emptiest places, there are still about 100,000 particles \nper cubic centimeter. But let's say an experiment like that\ncould somehow get every last atom out. There's still an unfathomably huge\namount of radiation all around us that can pass right through\nthe walls. Every second, about 50 muons\nfrom cosmic rays, 10 million neutrinos coming directly\nfrom the Big Bang, 30 million photons from the cosmic\nmicrowave background, and 300 trillion neutrinos\nfrom the Sun pass through your body. It is possible to shield\nvacuum chambers with substances, including water, that absorb and reflect this radiation, except for neutrinos. Let's say you've somehow removed\nall of the atoms and blocked all of the radiation. Is the space now totally empty? Actually, no. All space is filled with what \nphysicists call quantum fields. What we think of as subatomic particles, electrons and photons and their relatives, are actually vibrations \nin a quantum fabric that extends throughout the universe. And because of a physical law called\nthe Heisenberg Principle, these fields never stop oscillating, even without any particles \nto set off the ripples. They always have some minimum fluctuation\ncalled a vacuum fluctuation. This means they have energy,\na huge amount of it. Because Einstein's equations tell us\nthat mass and energy are equivalent, the quantum fluctuations in every\ncubic meter of space have an energy that corresponds\nto a mass of about four protons. In other words, the seemingly empty space\ninside your vacuum would actually weigh a small amount. Quantum fluctuations have existed since\nthe earliest moments of the universe. In the moments after the Big Bang, as the universe expanded, they were amplified and stretched out\nto cosmic scales. Cosmologists believe that these original\nquantum fluctuations were the seeds of everything\nwe see today: galaxies and the entire large scale\nstructure of the universe, as well as planets and solar systems. They're also the center of one of the\ngreatest scientific mysteries of our time because according to the current theories, the quantum fluctuations \nin the vacuum of space ought to have 120 orders of magnitude\nmore energy than we observe. Solving the mystery of that missing energy may entirely rewrite our understanding\nof physics and the universe."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What types of particles from cosmic sources go through your body most frequently?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Neutrinos, muons, photons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Protons and pions only"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Electrons and quarks only"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Alpha-, beta-, and gamma-rays"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the name of the coating of the beam pipes of the LHC at CERN that permits the creation of an ultrahigh vacuum?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stainless steel"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Non-evaporable getter (NEG)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "PVC"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Magnesium"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "After removing all the atoms and blocking all the radiation, what will remain in the space?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Electrons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Protons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Quantum fields"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Muons"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Quantum fields:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Have existed since the earliest moments of the universe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fill all space even though it may appear empty"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Extend throughout the universe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Continuously oscillate"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Vacuum cleaners work by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Creating a suction that pulls in dust and dander"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Using a fan to create a low pressure, relatively empty area that sucks matter in to fill the void"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Creating friction with the underlying carpet, resulting in static attraction of particulate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Any of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

They all came up with elegant\nproofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem, the rule that says for a right triangle, the square of one side plus\nthe square of the other side is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. In other words, a²+b²=c². This statement is one of the most\nfundamental rules of geometry, and the basis for practical applications, like constructing stable buildings\nand triangulating GPS coordinates. The theorem is named for Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher and mathematician\nin the 6th century B.C., but it was known more than a\nthousand years earlier. A Babylonian tablet from around 1800 B.C.\nlists 15 sets of numbers that satisfy the theorem. Some historians speculate \nthat Ancient Egyptian surveyors used one such set of numbers, 3, 4, 5,\nto make square corners. The theory is that surveyors could stretch\na knotted rope with twelve equal segments to form a triangle with sides of length\n3, 4 and 5. According to the converse\nof the Pythagorean theorem, that has to make a right triangle, and, therefore, a square corner. And the earliest known \nIndian mathematical texts written between 800 and 600 B.C. state that a rope stretched across\nthe diagonal of a square produces a square twice as large\nas the original one. That relationship can be derived\nfrom the Pythagorean theorem. But how do we know \nthat the theorem is true for every right triangle \non a flat surface, not just the ones these mathematicians\nand surveyors knew about? Because we can prove it. Proofs use existing mathematical rules\nand logic to demonstrate that a theorem\nmust hold true all the time. One classic proof often attributed\nto Pythagoras himself uses a strategy called \nproof by rearrangement. Take four identical right triangles\nwith side lengths a and b and hypotenuse length c. Arrange them so that their hypotenuses\nform a tilted square. The area of that square is c². Now rearrange the triangles\ninto two rectangles, leaving smaller squares on either side. The areas of those squares\nare a² and b². Here's the key. The total area of \nthe figure didn't change, and the areas of the triangles\ndidn't change. So the empty space in one, c² must be equal to \nthe empty space in the other, a² + b². Another proof comes from a fellow Greek\nmathematician Euclid and was also stumbled upon\nalmost 2,000 years later by twelve-year-old Einstein. This proof divides one right triangle\ninto two others and uses the principle that if the\ncorresponding angles of two triangles are the same, the ratio of their sides\nis the same, too. So for these three similar triangles, you can write these expressions\nfor their sides. Next, rearrange the terms. And finally, add the two equations\ntogether and simplify to get ab²+ac²=bc², or a²+b²=c². Here's one that uses tessellation, a repeating geometric pattern\nfor a more visual proof. Can you see how it works? Pause the video if you'd like some time\nto think about it. Here's the answer. The dark gray square is a² and the light gray one is b². The one outlined in blue is c². Each blue outlined square\ncontains the pieces of exactly one dark and one light gray square, proving the Pythagorean theorem again. And if you'd really like \nto convince yourself, you could build a turntable\nwith three square boxes of equal depth connected to each other \naround a right triangle. If you fill the largest square with water\nand spin the turntable, the water from the large square\nwill perfectly fill the two smaller ones. The Pythagorean theorem has more\nthan 350 proofs, and counting, ranging from brilliant to obscure.

{"page": 30, "lesson": 19, "title": "How you think about who you are matters more than ever - Chetan Bhatt", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/7UGVSqjr", "transcript": {"en": "I'm Chetan Bhatt and when I give my name,\nI'm often asked, \"Where are you from?\" And I normally say London. (Laughter) But of course, I know\nwhat they're really asking, so I say something like, \"Well, my grandparents and my mum\nwere born in India, my dad and I were born in Kenya, and I was brought up in London. And then they've got me mapped. \"Ah, you're a Kenyan Asian.\nI've worked with one of those.\" (Laughter) And from my name they probably\nassume that I'm a Hindu. And this sort of fixes me for them. But what about the Christians and the Muslims and the atheists that I grew up with? Or the socialists and the liberals, even the occasional Tory? (Laughter) Indeed, all kinds of women and men -- vegetable sellers, factory workers,\ncooks, car mechanics -- living in my working class area, in some profoundly important way, they are also a part of me and are here with me. Maybe that's why I find it hard\nto respond to questions about identity and about origin. And it's not just a sort of\nteenage refusal to be labeled. It's about our own most identities, the ones that we put our hands up to, the ones that we cheer for, the ones that we fight for, the ones that we love or hate. And it's about how we apprehend ourselves as well as others. And it's about identities\nwe just assume that we have without thinking too much about them. But our responses\nto questions of identity and origin have substantial\nsocial and political importance. We see the wars, the rages of identity\ngoing on all around us. We see violent religious,\nnational and ethnic disputes. And often the conflict is based\non old stories of identity and belonging and origins. And these identities are based on myths, typically about ancient,\nprimordial origins. And these could be about Adam and Eve or about the supremacy\nof a caste or gender or about the vitality of a supposed race or about the past glories\nof an empire or civilization or about a piece of land that some imagined deity has gifted. Now, people say that origin stories and identity myths\nmake us feel secure. What's wrong with that? They give us a sense of belonging. Identity is your cultural clothing, and it can make you feel\nwarm and fuzzy inside. But does it really? Do we really need\nidentity myths to feel safe? Because I see religious,\nnational, ethnic disputes as adding to human misery. Can I dare you to refuse every origin myth that claims you? What if we reject\nevery single primordial origin myth and develop a deeper sense of personhood, one responsible to humanity as a whole rather than to a particular tribe, a radically different idea of humanity that exposes how origin myths mystify, disguise global power, rapacious exploitation, poverty, the worldwide oppression\nof women and girls, and of course massive,\naccelerating inequalities? Now, origin myths\nare closely linked to tradition, and the word tradition\npoints to something old and permanent, almost natural, and people assume tradition\nis just history, simply the past\ncondensed into a nice story. But let's not confuse\ntradition with history. The two are often in severe conflict. Origin stories are usually recently\ncreated fictions of ancient belonging, and they're absurd given the complexity of humanity and our vastly interconnected,\neven if very unequal world. And today we see claims to tradition that claim to be ancient changing rapidly in front of our eyes. I was brought up in the 1970s near Wembley with Asian, English, Caribbean,\nIrish families living in our street, and the neo-Nazi National Front\nwas massive then with regular marches and attacks on us and a permanent threat and often a frequent reality\nof violence against us on the streets, in our homes, typically by neo-Nazis and other racists. And I remember during a general election\na leaflet came through our letter box with a picture of the National Front\ncandidate for our area. And the picture was of our next-door neighbor. He threatened to shoot me once\nwhen I played in the garden as a kid, and many weekends, shaven-headed\nNational Front activists arrived at his house and emerged with scores of placards screaming that they wanted us\nto go back home. But today he's one of my mum's best mates. He's a very lovely, gentle and kind man, and at some point in his\npolitical journey out of fascism he embraced a broader idea of humanity. There was a Hindu family\nthat we got to know well -- and you have to understand\nthat life in our street was a little bit like the setting\nfor an Asian soap opera. Everyone knew everyone else's business, even if they didn't want it\nto be known by anyone at all. You really had no choice in this matter. But in this family,\nthere was a quiet little boy who went to the same school as I did, and after I left school,\nI didn't hear much more about him, except that he'd gone off to India. Now around 2000, I remember seeing this short book. The book was unusual because it was written\nby a British supporter of Al Qaeda, and in it the author calls\nfor attacks in Britain. This is in 1999, so 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq\nwas still in the future, and he helped scout\nNew York bombing targets. He taught others how to make a dirty bomb\nto use on the London Underground, and he plotted a massive bombing campaign\nin London's shopping areas. He's a very high-risk security\nprisoner in the UK and one of the most important Al Qaeda\nfigures to be arrested in Britain. The author of that book was the very same quiet little boy who went to my school. So a Hindu boy from Britain became an Al Qaeda fighter and a most-wanted international terrorist, and he rejected what people would call\nhis Hindu or Indian or British identity, and he became someone else. He refused to be who he was. He recreated himself, and this kind of journey is very common for young men and women who become involved\nin Al Qaeda or Islamic State or other transnational armed groups. Al Qaeda's media spokesman\nis a white American from a Jewish and Catholic\nmixed background, and neither he nor the boy from my school were from Muslim backgrounds. There's no point in asking them\nwhere are they from. A more important question is\nwhere they're going. And I would also put it to you that exactly the same journey\noccurs for those young men and women who were brought up\nin Muslim family backgrounds. Most of those who join Al Qaeda and other Salafi jihadi groups\nfrom Europe, Asia, North America, even in many cases the Middle East are those who have comprehensively\nrejected their backgrounds to become, in essence, new people. They spend an enormous amount of time\nattacking their parents' backgrounds as profane, impure, blasphemous, the wrong type of Islam, and their vision instead is a fantastical view\nof cosmic apocalypse. It's a born again vision. Discard your past,\nyour society, your family and friends since they're all impure. Instead, become someone else, your true self, your authentic self. Now, this isn't\nabout a return to the past. It's about using a forgery of the past to envision an appalling future\nwhich begins today at year zero. This is why over 80 percent of the victims\nof Al Qaeda and Islamic State are people from Muslim backgrounds. The first act by Salafi jihadi groups\nwhen they take over an area is to destroy existing Muslim institutions including mosques,\nshrines, preachers, practices. Their main purpose is to control\nand punish people internally, to dictate the spaces that women may go, their clothing, family relations, beliefs, even the minute detail\nof how one prays. And you get the impression in the news that they are after us in the West, but they are actually mainly after\npeople from other Muslim backgrounds. In their view, no other Muslim\ncan ever be pure enough, so ordinary beliefs and practices\nthat have existed for centuries are attacked as impure by teenagers from Birmingham or London who know nothing about the histories\nthat they so joyously obliterate. Now here, their claim to tradition\nis at war with history, but they're nevertheless\nvery certain about their purity and about the impurity of others. Purity, certainty, the return to authentic tradition, the quest for these\ncan lead to lethal visions of perfect societies and perfected people. This is what the main Hindu\nfundamentalist organization in India looks like today at its mass rally. Maybe it reminds you\nof the 1930s in Italy or Germany, and the movement's roots\nare indeed in fascism. It was a member of the same\nHindu fundamentalist movement who shot dead Mahatma Gandhi. Hindu fundamentalists today\nview this murderer as a national hero, and they want to put up\nstatues of him throughout India. They've been involved for decades in large-scale mass violence\nagainst minorities. They ban books, art, films. They attack romantic couples\non Valentine's Day, Christians on Christmas Day. They don't like others talking critically about what they see\nas their ancient culture or using its images or caricaturing it or drawing cartoons about it. But the people making\nthe strongest possible claims about ancient, timeless Hindu religion are dressed in brown shorts\nand white shirts while claiming, oddly, to be the original Aryan race, just like the violent Salafi jihadis who make their claims\nabout their primordial religion while dressed in black military uniforms and wearing balaclavas. These people are manufacturing\npure, pristine identities of conviction and of certainty. Fundamentalists see religion and culture\nas their sole property, a property. But religions and cultures are processes. They're not things. They're impermanent.\nThey're messy. They're impure. Look at any religion\nand you'll see disputes and arguments going all the way down. Any criticism of religion in any form has to therefore be part of the expansive sense of humanity we should aspire to. I respect your right\nto have and to express your religion or your culture or your opinion, but I don't necessarily\nhave to respect the content. I might like some of it. I might like how an old church\nlooks, for example, but this isn't the same thing. Similarly, I have a human right to say something\nthat you may find offensive, but you do not have a human right\nnot to be offended. In a genuine democracy,\nwe're constantly offended since people express\ndifferent views all the time. They also change their views, so their views are impermanent. You cannot fix someone's political views based on their religious\nor national or cultural background. Now, these points about religious purity also apply to nationalism and to racism. I'm always puzzled to have pride in your national\nor ethnic identity, pride in the accident of birth\nfrom a warm and cozy womb, belief in your superiority\nbecause of the accident of birth. These people have very firm ideas about what belongs and what doesn't belong inside the cozy national cultures\nthat they imagine. And I'm going to caricature a bit here,\nbut only a little bit. I want you to imagine\nthe supporter of some Little Englander or British nationalist political party, and he's sitting at home and he's screaming about foreigners invading his country while watching Fox News, an American cable channel owned by an Australian on his South Korean television set which was bought\nby his Spanish credit card which is paid off monthly\nby his high-street British bank which has its headquarters in Hong Kong. He supports a British football team\nowned by a Russian. His favorite brand of fish and chips is owned by a Swedish\nventure capitalist firm. The church he sometimes goes to has its creed decided\nin meetings in Ghana. His Union Jack underpants were made in India. (Laughter) And -- (Applause) Thank you. And they're laundered regularly by a very nice Polish lady. (Laughter) There is no pure ethnicity,\nnational culture, and the ethical choices we have today are far wider than being forced to choose between racist right\nand religious right visions, dismal visions of culture. Now, culture isn't just\nabout language, food, clothing and music, but gender relations, ancient monuments, a heritage of sacred texts. But culture can also be\nwhat has been decided to be culture by those who have a political stake in pounding culture\ninto the shape of a prison. Big political identity claims\nare elite bids for power. They're not answers to social\nor economic or political injustices. They often obscure them. And what about the large number\nof people across the globe who can't point\nto a monument from their past, who don't possess a sacred written text, who can't hark back to the past glories\nof a civilization or empire? Are these people less a part of humanity? What about you, now, listening to this? What about you and your identity, because you stitch your experiences\nand your thoughts into a continuous person moving forward in time. And this is what you are when you say, \"I,\" \"am,\" or \"me.\" But this also includes\nall of your hopes and dreams, all of the you's that could have been, and it includes all the other people and the things that are\nin the biography of who you are. They, the others, are also a part of you, moving forward with you. Your authentic self,\nif such a thing exists, is a complex, messy and uncertain self, and that is a very good thing. Why not value those\nimpurities and uncertainties? Maybe clinging to pure identities\nis a sign of immaturity, and ethnic, nationalist\nand religious traditions are bad for you. Why not be skeptical\nabout every primordial origin claim made on your behalf? Why not reject the identity myths\nthat call on you to belong, that politicians and community leaders, so-called community leaders, place on you? If we don't need origin stories\nand fixed identities, we can challenge ourselves\nto think creatively about each other and our future. And here culture\nalways takes care of itself. I'm not worried about culture. Cultures are creative, dynamic processes, not imposed laws and boundaries. This is Abu al-Walid Muhammad\nibn Ahmad ibn Rushd, a very senior Muslim judge and thinker\nin Cordoba in the 12th century, and his writings were considered\ndeeply blasphemous, heretical and evil. Long after he died, followers of his work\nwere ruthlessly hunted down, banished and killed over several centuries by the most powerful religious institution\nof the medieval period. That institution was\nthe Roman Catholic Church. Why? Because ibn Rushd said\nthat something true in religion may conflict with something that your reason\nfinds to be true on earth, but the latter is still true. There are two distinct worlds of truth, one based on our reason and evidence,\nand one that is divine, and the state, political power, social law\nare in the realm of reason. Religious life is a different realm. They should be kept separated. Social and political life\nshould be governed by our reason, not by religion. And you can see why the church\nwas upset by his writings, as indeed were some Muslims\nduring his lifetime, because he gives us\na strong statement of secularism of a kind which is normal in Europe today. Now, history plays many tricks on us. It undermines our fixed truths and what we believe\nto be our culture and their culture. Ibn Rushd, someone\nwho happens to be a Muslim, is considered one of the key influences in the introduction and spread\nof secularism in Europe. So against religious, nationalist\nand racial purists of all kinds, can you make his story a part of your own, not because he happened to be a Muslim, not because he happened to be an Arab, but because he was a human being with some very good ideas that shook his world and ours. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

His son was like “Hey that’s cool” so\nhe built one too.. Then his son was like “Me too” so he\nmade a third and they were all buried there. And that’s how we got this. The pyramids of Giza. How did people who hadn’t even invented\nthe wheel build these things, and… why? They’re so big! They’re so precise! They’re so directionally oriented! They’re so mysterrrrrrious. At first glance they really do look out-of-this\nworld. Thing is, the pyramids are much older than\nyou probably think. They were already ancient history to people\nIN ancient history, which led to some pretty wild theories about how they came to be. But pyramid technology didn’t just show\nup out of nowhere. It was the end product of centuries of scientific\nand cultural evolution, of people… figuring it out. And it definitely wasn’t aliens. [OPEN] Early on, Egyptians buried their dead like\nwe do. The desert naturally mummified some corpses,\nwhich influenced their religious beliefs: You need to preserve the body to reach the\nafterlife, and when you get there you’ll need all your stuff. Rich people’s graves had nicer stuff, and\nthey needed to protect their afterlife investment. First with simple mounds, and later with mud\nbrick “eternal houses”. Then a king named Djoser was like “Why have\none little mud mastaba when I can have six stone mastabas in a stack?” so he stacked\nsix stone mastabas like a mastaba boss and the age of the pyramids had begun. This was literally the first time humans had\npiled stone this high. Egyptians knew totally vertical walls got\nless stable as they got taller, so Djoser’s architect stacked bricks at an incline and\nlet gravity do the work. Step pyramid achieved! Why pyramids and not other shapes? If you want to make a big pile of blocks,\na pyramid gets you the most stability for the least material. A third of the way up, you’ve already laid\ntwo-thirds of your stone. Halfway, you’ve placed more than 80%. Next comes Sneferu, Mr. Pyramid. He built his own step pyramid, but then decided\nhe wanted a smooth one instead, so they started on a second. No one had ever built one of those before,\nso they made some mistakes. For starters, they built it on sand, which\nis soft, they laid blocks carelessly, and it was too steep, so halfway through they\nchanged the slope and ended up with this. Sneferu was like “you’re not burying me\nin that”, so he ordered a third pyramid! Only this time they built a solid foundation,\nlaid the stones in horizontal rows, and precision cut the edges. Sneferu’s motto? If at first you don’t succeed, try again,\nand then try again one more time. Sneferu had experimented his way to a blueprint\nfor building awesome pyramids The Great Pyramid at Giza, built by his son\nKhufu, took that blueprint to the next level. Khufu’s pyramid remained the tallest structure\non Earth for almost 4000 years, until some church tower in the year 1311, which fell\ndown, so it was tallest again until this radio antenna was finished in 1889. Khufu’s son Khafre built his pyramid right\nnext to dad’s, and he didn’t stop innovating. Instead of leveling the entire 46,000 square\nmeter footprint, he built his pyramid over a natural stone mound and only leveled the\nouter edge, which was less work, duh! It’s 3 meters shorter than his dad’s,\nbut this higher ground creates the illusion that Khafre’s pyramid is taller. Kids, amirite? But even these seemingly perfect pyramids\nweren’t without mistakes. Khafre’s had a slight twist near the top\nin order to make the edges line up evenly. What’s remarkable is Egypt’s biggest stone\npyramids were the product of just three human generations, but those were generations full\nof trial and error. Pyramid building continued for nearly 700\nyears, and like any product, efficiency started to win out over quality. Precision-cut cores were replaced by rough-cut\nblocks. Kings still wrapped their pyramids in fine\nwhite limestone, but over the next thousand years that was removed by stone stealers and\nrock robbers, leaving the cheaply-produced cores to collapse into rubble, which is probably\nwhy you’ve never heard of them. Ironically, the kings were probably disappointed\nby the whole afterlife thing, but the pyramids themselves have proven to be surprisingly\nresilient. Ancient is not a synonym for stupid. The world’s first skyscrapers were tombs,\nand just like our own buildings, they didn’t spring up out of nowhere, they were the product\nof centuries of engineering trial and error. Go back 500 years and show someone a smartphone\nand they’d probably think you were a wizard.

Panicked residents believed their city\nhad been attacked using chemical warfare. But the cloud wasn't an act of war. It was smog. A portmanteau \nof smoke and fog, the word \"smog\" was coined at the beginning\nof the 20th century to describe the thick gray \nhaze that covered cities such as London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. This industrial smog was known to form when smoke from coal-burning \nhome stoves and factories combined with moisture in the air. But the smog behind \nthe LA panic was different. It was yellowish with a chemical odor. Since the city didn't burn much coal,\nits cause would remain a mystery until a chemist named Arie Haagen-Smit\nidentified two culprits: volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and nitrogen oxides. VOCs are compounds that easily\nbecome vapors and may contain elements, such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, and sulfur. Some are naturally produced \nby plants and animals, but others come from manmade sources, like solvents, paints, glues, and petroleum. Meanwhile, the incomplete combustion\nof gas in motor vehicles releases nitrogen oxide. That's what gives this type of smog\nits yellowish color. VOCs and nitrogen oxide react with sunlight to produce secondary pollutants called\nPANs and tropospheric, or ground-level, ozone. PANs and ozone cause eye irritation\nand damage lung tissue. Both are key ingredients \nin photochemical smog, which is what had been plaguing LA. So why does smog affect some cities\nbut not others? Both industrial and photochemical smog\ncombine manmade pollution with local weather and geography. London's high humidity made it a prime\nlocation for industrial smog. Photochemical smog is strongest in\nurban areas with calm winds and dry, warm, sunny weather. The ultraviolet radiation from sunlight\nprovides the energy necessary to breakdown molecules that contribute\nto smog formation. Cities surrounded by mountains, like LA, or lying in a basin, like Beijing, are also especially vulnerable to smog\nsince there's nowhere for it to dissipate. That's also partially due to a phenomenon\nknown as temperature inversion, where instead of warm air \ncontinuously rising upward, a pollution-filled layer of air remains \ntrapped near the Earth's surface by a slightly warmer layer above. Smog isn't just an aesthetic eyesore. Both forms of smog irritate the eyes, nose, and throat, exacerbate conditions like asthma\nand emphysema, and increase the risk \nof respiratory infections like bronchitis. Smog can be especially harmful \nto young children and older people and exposure in pregnant women has been\nlinked to low birth weight and potential birth defects. Secondary pollutants found \nin photochemical smog can damage and weaken crops\nand decrease yield, making them more susceptible to insects. Yet for decades, smog was seen\nas the inevitable price of civilization. Londoners had become accustomed to \nthe notorious pea soup fog swirling over their streets until 1952, when the Great Smog of London shut down\nall transportation in the city for days and caused more \nthan 4,000 respiratory deaths. As a result, the Clean Air Act of 1956 banned burning coal in \ncertain areas of the city, leading to a massive reduction in smog. Similarly, regulations on vehicle \nemissions and gas content in the US reduced the volatile compounds in the air\nand smog levels along with them. Smog remains a major problem\naround the world. Countries like China and Poland that\ndepend on coal for energy experience high levels of industrial smog. Photochemical smog and airborne particles\nfrom vehicle emissions affect many rapidly developing cities, from Mexico City and Santiago to New Delhi and Tehran. Governments have tried many methods\nto tackle it, such as banning cars from driving\nfor days at a time. As more than half of the world's \npopulation crowds into cities, considering a shift to mass transit\nand away from fossil fuels may allow us to breathe easier."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The burning of which fuel is the main source of industrial smog?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oil"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Coal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Natural gas"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Biomass"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A ___________ haze is associated with industrial smog, while a ___________ haze is associated with photochemical smog.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gray, yellowish"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yellowish, gray"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which product of incomplete combustion gives photochemical smog its yellowish color?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "PANs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ozone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "VOCs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nitrous oxide"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Common sources of volatile organic compounds include:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Solvents"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Paints and glue"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Some plants"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Petroleum"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The two secondary pollutants associated with photochemical smog that cause both eye irritation and potential lung damage are:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ozone"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nitrous oxide"}, {"label": "C", "text": "PANs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ozone and PANs"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What are 4 characteristics of urban areas with high levels of photochemical smog?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Calm winds, dry weather, sunny, many industries and vehicles"}, {"label": "B", "text": "High winds, wet weather, cloudy, many industries and vehicles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Located in a basin or surrounded by mountains"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Located in a basin or surrounded by mountains, calm winds, dry weather, sunny, many industries and vehicles"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

The tomato is putting up a fight\nusing both physical and chemical defenses to repel the attacking insects. But that's not all. The tomato is also releasing compounds\nthat signal nearby tomato plants to release their own insect repellent. Plants are constantly under attack. They face threats ranging from \nmicroscopic fungi and bacteria, small herbivores, like aphids,\ncaterpillars, and grasshoppers, up to large herbivores, like tortoises,\nkoalas, and elephants. All are looking to devour plants\nto access the plentiful nutrients and water in their leaves, stems,\nfruits, and seeds. But plants are ready with a whole\nseries of internal and external defenses that make them a much less \nappealing meal, or even a deadly one. Plants' defenses start at their surface. The bark covering tree trunks is full\nof lignin, a rigid web of compounds that's\ntough to chew and highly impermeable to pathogens. Leaves are protected by\na waxy cuticle that deters insects and microbes. Some plants go a step further\nwith painful structures to warn would-be predators. Thorns, spines, and prickles\ndiscourage bigger herbivores. To deal with smaller pests, some plants'\nleaves have sharp hair-like structures called trichomes. The kidney bean plant sports tiny\nhooks to stab the feet of bed bugs and other insects. In some species, trichomes also dispense\nchemical irritants. Stinging nettles release a mixture\nof histamine and other toxins that cause pain and inflammation\nwhen touched. For other plant species, the pain comes\nafter an herbivore's first bite. Spinach, kiwi fruit, pineapple, fuchsia and rhubarb all produce microscopic\nneedle-shaped crystals called raphides. They can cause tiny wounds in the inside\nof animals' mouths, which create entry points for toxins. The mimosa plant has a strategy\ndesigned to prevent herbivores from taking a bite at all. Specialized mechanoreceptor cells\ndetect touch and shoot an electrical signal\nthrough the leaflet to its base causing cells there to release\ncharged particles. The buildup of charge draws\nwater out of these cells and they shrivel, \npulling the leaflet closed. The folding movement scares insects away and the shrunken leaves look less\nappealing to larger animals. If these external defenses are breached, the plant immune system \nsprings into action. Plants don't have a separate immune system\nlike animals. Instead, every cell has the ability\nto detect and defend against invaders. Specialized receptors can recognize \nmolecules that signal the presence of dangerous microbes or insects. In response, the immune system initiates \na battery of defensive maneuvers. To prevent more pathogens from making\ntheir way inside, the waxy cuticle thickens and cell walls\nget stronger. Guard cells seal up pores in the leaves. And if microbes are devouring one section\nof the plant, those cells can self-destruct \nto quarantine the infection. Compounds toxic to microbes and insects\nare also produced, often tailor-made for a specific threat. Many of the plant molecules that humans\nhave adopted as drugs, medicines and seasonings evolved as part of plants' immune systems\nbecause they're antimicrobial, or insecticidal. An area of a plant under attack can alert\nother regions using hormones, airborne compounds, or even electrical signals. When other parts of the plant detect\nthese signals, they ramp up production\nof defensive compounds. And for some species, like tomatoes, this early warning system also\nalerts their neighbors. Some plants can even recruit\nallies to adopt a strong offense against their would-be attackers. Cotton plants under siege by caterpillars release a specific cocktail of ten\nto twelve chemicals into the air. This mixture attracts parasitic wasps \nthat lay eggs inside the caterpillars. Plants may not be able to flee the scene\nof an attack, or fight off predators with teeth\nand claws, but with sturdy armor, a well-stocked chemical arsenal, a neighborhood watch, and cross-species alliances, a plant isn't always an easy meal."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Trichomes are little hair-like structures that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Regulate plants' temperatures"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Trap small pests and produce chemical irritant molecules"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cause tiny wounds inside animals’ mouths because of their needle-shape"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sense air vibrations that indicate the presence of insects"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "One of the defense strategies that Mimosa plants use against herbivores is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Producing flashy yellow flowers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Germinating very fast"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Shriveling their leaves"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Staying underground"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The immune systems of plants rely on:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The capacity of each cell to recognize and defend against attackers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Specialized cells like in mammals"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Antibodies that are stored in each cell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Their capacity to regulate their temperature to restrict microbe growth"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Leaves of most plants are protected against bacteria and fungi by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A light-reflecting cuticle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A sticky cuticle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A smelly cuticle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A waxy cuticle"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When microbes are devouring one section of a plant, cells can self-destruct to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Restrict the spread of the microbes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Decrease the photosynthesis activity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Attract natural predators"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tell other surrounding plants that they are attacked"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 30, "lesson": 23, "title": "How does impeachment work? - Alex Gendler", "category": "Civics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-does-impeachment-work-alex-gendler", "transcript": {"en": "For most jobs, it's understood\nthat you can be fired, whether for crime, incompetence, or just poor performance. But what if your job happens to be\nthe most powerful position in the country, or the world? That's where impeachment comes in. Impeachment isn't the same\nas actually removing someone from office. Like an indictment in criminal court, it's only the formal accusation \nthat launches a trial, which could end in conviction\nor acquittal. Originating in the United Kingdom, impeachment allowed Parliament to vote for\nremoving a government official from office even without the king's consent. Although this was an important check\non royal power, the king couldn't be impeached because the monarch was considered\nthe source of all government power. But for the founders \nof the American Republic, there was no higher authority\nbeyond the people themselves. And so impeachment was adopted in\nthe United States as a power of Congress applying to any civil officers,\nup to and including the president. Although demands for impeachment\ncan come from any members of the public, only the House of Representatives has the\npower to actually initiate the process. It begins by referring the matter\nto a committee, usually the House Committee on Rules and the House Committee on the Judiciary. These committees review the accusations, examine the evidence, and issue a recommendation. If they find sufficient \ngrounds to proceed, the House holds a separate vote\non each of the specific charges, known as Articles of Impeachment. If one or more passes \nby a simple majority, the official is impeached\nand the stage is set for trial. The actual trial that follows impeachment\nis held in the Senate. Selected members of the House,\nknown as managers, act as the prosecution, while the impeached official \nand their lawyers present their defense. The Senate acts as both judge and jury, conducting the trial and deliberating\nafter hearing all the arguments. If it's the president or vice president\nbeing impeached, the chief justice \nof the Supreme Court presides. A conviction requires a supermajority\nof two-thirds and results in automatic removal \nfrom power. Depending on the original charges, it can also disqualify them\nfrom holding office in the future and open them to standard \ncriminal prosecution. So what exactly can get someone impeached? That's a bit more complicated. Unlike in the United Kingdom, impeachment in the U.S. \npits an elected legislature against other democratically \nelected members of government. Therefore, to prevent the process\nfrom being used as a political weapon, the Constitution specifies that \nan official can only be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes\nand misdemeanors. That still leaves a lot of room \nfor interpretation, not to mention politics, and many impeachment trials\nhave split along partisan lines. But the process is generally understood to\nbe reserved for serious abuses of power. The first official to be impeached was\nTennesse Senator William Blount in 1797 for conspiring with Britain to cease\nthe Spanish colony of Louisiana. Since then, the House has launched\nimpeachment investigations about 60 times, but only 19 have led to actual\nimpeachment proceedings. The eight cases that ended\nin a conviction and removal from office were all federal judges. And impeachment of a sitting president\nis even more rare. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868 for attempting to replace Secretary of War\nEdwin Stanton without consulting the Senate. Over a century later, Bill Clinton \nwas impeached for making false statements under oath\nduring a sexual harassment trial. Both were ultimately acquitted\nwhen the Senate's votes to convict fell short of the required \ntwo-thirds majority. And contrary to popular belief, Richard Nixon was never actually impeached\nfor the Watergate scandal. He resigned before it could happen knowing he would almost certainly\nbe convicted. Theoretically, the U.S. government is \nalready designed to prevent abuses of power, limiting different branches\nthrough a system of checks and balances, term limits, and free elections. But impeachment can be seen\nas an emergency brake for when these safeguards fail."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What does impeachment mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Removal from office"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Conviction of a crime"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Formal accusation of wrongdoing"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who can formally initiate the impeachment process?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The House of Representatives"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Any citizen of the United States"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The President"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Where does the impeachment trial take place?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The White House"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Senate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Supreme Court"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many votes are required for conviction of a president or vice president?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A simple majority"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A unanimous vote"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A supermajority"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following presidents was NOT formally impeached?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Andrew Johnson"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Richard Nixon"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bill Clinton"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

These oily films are hundreds of times\nthinner than a strand of spider silk, yet strong enough to protect\nthe delicate contents of life: the cell's watery cytoplasm, \ngenetic material, organelles, and all the molecules it needs to survive. How does the membrane work,\nand where does that strength come from? First of all, it's tempting to think of a\ncell membrane like the tight skin of a balloon, but it's actually something \nmuch more complex. In reality, it's constantly in flux, shifting components back and forth\nto help the cell take in food, remove waste, let specific molecules in and out, communicate with other cells, gather information about the environment, and repair itself. The cell membrane gets this resilience,\nflexibility, and functionality by combining a variety \nof floating components in what biologists call a fluid mosaic. The primary component of the fluid mosaic is a simple molecule \ncalled a phospholipid. A phospholipid has a polar, \nelectrically-charged head, which attracts water, and a non-polar tail, which repels it. They pair up tail-to-tail\nin a two layer sheet just five to ten nanometers thick\nthat extends all around the cell. The heads point in towards the cytoplasm and out towards the watery fluid \nexternal to the cell with the lipid tails \nsandwiched in between. This bilayer, which at body temperature\nhas the consistency of vegetable oil, is studded with other types of molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and cholesterol. Cholesterol keeps the membrane \nat the right fluidity. It also helps regulate communication\nbetween cells. Sometimes, cells talk to each other by releasing and capturing \nchemicals and proteins. The release of proteins is easy, but the capture of them \nis more complicated. That happens through a process called\nendocytosis in which sections of the membrane\nengulf substances and transport them into the cell\nas vesicles. Once the contents have been released, the vesicles are recycled and returned\nto the cell membrane. The most complex components\nof the fluid mosaic are proteins. One of their key jobs is to make sure that the right molecules \nget in and out of the cell. Non-polar molecules, like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and certain vitamins can cross the phospholipid \nbilayer easily. But polar and charged molecules can't\nmake it through the fatty inner layer. Transmembrane proteins stretch\nacross the bilayer to create channels that allow specific molecules through,\nlike sodium and potassium ions. Peripheral proteins floating\nin the inner face of the bilayer help anchor the membrane to the cell's\ninterior scaffolding. Other proteins in cell membranes\ncan help fuse two different bilayers. That can work to our benefit,\nlike when a sperm fertilizes an egg, but also harm us,\nas it does when a virus enters a cell. And some proteins move within\nthe fluid mosaic, coming together to form complexes\nthat carry out specific jobs. For instance, one complex might\nactivate cells in our immune system, then move apart when the job is done. Cell membranes are also the site\nof an ongoing war between us and all the things\nthat want to infect us. In fact, some of the most toxic\nsubstances we know of are membrane-breaching proteins\nmade by infectious bacteria. These pore-forming toxins poke\ngiant holes in our cell membranes, causing a cell's contents to leak out. Scientists are working on developing\nways to defend against them, like using a nano-sponge \nthat saves our cells by soaking up \nthe membrane-damaging toxins. The fluid mosaic is what makes \nall the functions of life possible.
