{"page": 29, "lesson": 1, "title": "The Psychology of Listicles", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/4JblHERx", "transcript": {"en": "Whether you love it or hate it, the listicle\n– a blend of list and article – has quickly become a very popular content format. 22 brain facts, 29 Things Australians Say\n(That Americans Don't), 17 things humanity ruined in 2015. Pets? Really?! Listicles are everywhere. So, why are they so popular? There are some ideas, based in science, that\nexplain why. Listicles are readable and easy to digest,\nthey’re kind of like the graphic novel of the internet. And they play a role in curating information. Researchers estimated that in 2008, people\nconsumed 60% more information than they did in 1960. Back then, the average American spent 7.4\nhours a day, outside of work, watching, reading and listening to things; on the phone and\nhaving conversations with other people. In 2008 that number was a 11.8 hours a day,\nand today it’s closer to 13 hours. Because we consume so much stuff, we’re\npretty distracted. A curated list appeals to us. Part of this appeal is being able to skim\nor quickly look at a listicle and process all of it’s content. The headlines help by telling us exactly what\nwe’re going to get: The 25 Most Huggable Pokémon. So, we’re satisfied. But this ease of processing information can\nlead to some interesting effects. At the core of this is cognitive fluency–it’s\na measure of how easy it is to think about something. People like thinking about things that are\neasier to think about, compared to things that are hard to think about. No surprises there. And generally, the more fluently you can process\nan object, the more positive your response is to it. Let’s take a closer look. In one study, researchers showed participants\na statement, like “Osorno is in Chile” in colours that made it easy or difficult\nto read. Moderately visible statements were judged\nas true, and highly visible statements were judged as true significantly above what people\nwould choose by chance. The researchers concluded that fluently we\nperceive things affects our judgments of truth. Another study found when participants looked\nat images that were easier to process, they twitched their muscles into a little subconscious\nsmile. We can’t infer that reading listicles make\nus smile, but consuming easier to process information just might. And easy-to-process information isn’t new\nto the “internet age”, it’s had an important role throughout culture. “It certainly has” Okay here’s Mike, from Idea Channel. “Hey Vanessa! Yeah, it’s really easy to look our current,\nlist-laden moment and feel overwhelmed! Or like the internet, with all its distractions\nand blinking animated GIFs and pictures of cute cats, has given rise to this particular\nand particularly easy to digest format. The listicle FEELS like it’s VERY INTERNET. Mark O’Connell, for the New York Times,\nwrites that online browsing often seems like “a comic nightmare of futile enumeration. The point of counting is, in a way, to get\nto the end of counting; but this is a counting that admits of no conclusion—a bottomless\ninventory of everything and nothing.” Mark may be more right than he realizes. The listicle has been around for much, much\nlonger than the internet has, and may be on one of the central ways we’ve cataloged\nand organized the world for a long time. It’s just that, with the internet, we realize\nthe true infinity of whats available for sorting and cataloging, and lists doing so. Like, 5 genius trashcan lifehacks or The 21\nMost Important Raccoons Of 2015 or 159 Disney Quotes For When You Need An Instagram Caption\nor 6 Video Games That Failed Before You Pressed Start or OK OK I’m gonna stop before this\nbecomes a listicle listicle. If you wanna hear more about the 29 different\nways listicles have been perhaps flawed–but definitely important and interesting–throughout\nhistory, head on over to Idea Channel when you’re done here. Thanks, Vanessa!” Of course! But as much as we’ve liked lists throughout\nhistory, it’s not a perfect format. Sure, some people will say “listicles are\nruining journalism”, but we don’t speak of the impact of the format as much as the\nway it’s written. In my humble opinion, you don’t remember\nlisticles. You don’t learn things from them. I’ve tried to think about any list article\nor video that I’ve read or watched in my entire life, and I can only remember two from\nthe past two years: 37 Signs You Grew Up In Australia In The ’90s and 20 Facts about\nthe Muppets. And I probably remember these because Agro’s\ncartoon connection, zooper doopers and Kermit resonate with me on a deep emotional level. And this is the thing about listicles: they’re\njust like a zooper dooper or a popsicle in that they’re appealing, you can start and\nfinish it in two minutes, and you’ll be somewhat satisfied. Some people even say that listicles activate\nyour brain's reward system, so you’ll finish wanting more. In his TED talk, psychology professor Peter\nDolittle says that your working memory is about the size of a pea. You need to use it to make sense of all the\ninformation you encounter every day and it’s limited in its capacity, duration and focus. You tend to remember about 4 things for 10-20\nseconds unless you do something with it–like apply that knowledge to something you already\nknow or talk to someone about it. Otherwise, any bite of information, is (in\na manner of speaking) in one ear and out the other. Don’t get me wrong, the listicle isn’t\na bad thing! It has a well-deserved place in the media\nlandscape as a piece of entertainment and our brains love that we can fluently process\nthem. But as pieces of education, I’m not convinced. And if you want to hear Mike’s voice again,\nand even see his face, head over to Idea Channel for his take on humanity and the listicle. And, maybe to see 15 hedgehogs with things\nthat look like hedgehogs.

So how many different tenses are there\nin a language like English? At first, the answer seems obvious: there's past, present, and future. But thanks to something called\ngrammatical aspect, each of those time periods \nactually divides further. There are four kinds of aspect. In the continuous or progressive aspect, the actions are still happening \nat the time of reference. The perfect aspect describes actions\nthat are finished. The perfect progressive aspect \nis a combination, describing a completed part \nof a continuous action. And finally, there's the simple aspect, the basic form of the past, \npresent, and future tense, where an action is not specified\nas continuous or discrete. That's all a little hard to follow,\nso let's see how it works in action. Let's say your friends tell you\nthey went on a secret naval mission to collect evidence \nof a mysterious sea creature. The tense sets the overall frame\nof reference in the past, but within that, there are many options. Your friends might say a creature\nattacked their boat, that's the past simple,\nthe most general aspect, which gives no further clarification. They were sleeping when it happened, a continuous process \nunderway at that point. They might also tell you they had departed\nfrom Nantucket to describe an action \ncompleted even earlier. That's an example of the past perfect. Or that they had been sailing \nfor three weeks, something that was ongoing \nup until that point. In the present, they tell you that \nthey still search for the creature today, their present simple activity. Perhaps they are preparing for their\nnext mission continuously as they speak. And they have built a special \nsubmarine for it, a completed achievement. Plus, if they have been researching\npossible sightings of the creature, it's something they've been doing \nfor a while and are still doing now making it present perfect progressive. So what does this next mission hold? You know it still hasn't happened\nbecause they will depart next week, the future simple. Your friends will be searching \nfor the elusive creature, an extended continuous undertaking. They tell you the submarine will have\nreached uncharted depths a month from now. That's a confident prediction about what will be achieved \nby a specific point in the future, a point at which they \nwill have been voyaging for three weeks in the future perfect progressive. The key insight to all these \ndifferent tenses is that each sentence takes place\nin a specific moment, whether it's past, present, or future. The point of aspects is that they tell you\nas of that moment the status of the action. In total, they give us twelve \npossibilities in English. What about other languages? Some, like French, Swahili, and Russian\ntake a similar approach to English. Others describe \nand divide time differently. Some have fewer grammatical tenses,\nlike Japanese, which only distinguishes past \nfrom non-past, Buli and Tukang Basi, which only distinguish future \nfrom non-future, and Mandarin Chinese \nwith no verb tenses at all, only aspect. On the other hand, languages like Yagwa\nsplit past tense into multiple degrees, like whether something happened hours, \nweeks, or years ago. In others, tenses are intertwined\nwith moods that can convey urgency, necessity, or probability of events. This makes translation difficult\nbut not impossible. Speakers of most languages without certain\ntenses can express the same ideas with auxiliary words, \nlike would or did, or by specifying the time they mean. Are the variations \nfrom language to language just differents ways of describing\nthe same fundamental reality? Or do their diverse structures reflect\ndifferent ways of thinking about the world and even time itself?

I just learned about a dog named\nChaser. Chaser is a border collie who has a vocabulary of more than 1,000 words, that’s\nlike the same as a 4-year-old child. What makes Chaser even more special is that he\ncan even separate nouns from verbs. \"take lips. Do it girl!\"\n\"Good girl, good girl.\" \"Paw lamb, paw lamb, Chaser\"\n\"Good girl, good girl\" \"Nose ABC, nose ABC.\"\n\"Good girl, good girl!\" This is Oliver. Oliver, you think you're smarter\nthan Chaser? What do you say? Yeah, let's go find out. Come on! Get your ball. Where's your ball? Get your bone. Where's your bone? Nope, that's your ball.\nWhere's your bone? Bone. Bone. Nope. Find your bone? Where's your bone?\nOkay, so maybe Oliver's not that good at this particular test, but the fact that we even\ntry to communicate with dogs, and that they communicate back with us, means that the human-dog\nrelationship is truly something special. \"Who's the best boy? (baby talk)\" I… have been known to talk to dogs a little. (baby talk)\n(baby talk) Or a lot. (baby talk) It’s hard to know if they’re responding\nto the words, or just the emotion in my voice. Or the fact that I sound ridiculous. One recent\nstudy suggests it’s both. Or all three. Researchers at the University of Sussex played\nsounds out of speakers on both sides of a dog. When dogs heard commands stripped of\ntheir emotional context, they turned their head to the right, suggesting they process\nverbal meaning in their left hemisphere. And when they heard the emotional sounds in the\nvoice, but the words were jumbled, they turned to the left, suggesting they process emotional\nsounds on the right. These experiments show that dogs can definitely\nseparate the meaning of words from the emotion attached. But how much information do they\ntake from each? When I ask my dogs “Do you want to go for\na walk?” they aren’t processing the real meaning of that sentence the way we do, like\n“Hmm, lemme see, do I want to go for a walk right now? Get some exercise? Maybe I’m\njust not feeling it today? I mean, I’m a dog, what does it even mean to WANT something?” As good as dogs are with words, in many of\nour interactions there’s probably a good amount of Clever Hans at play. In the early\n1900’s a horse named Hans was said to be able to solve simple math problems by tapping\nhis hoof to represent numbers. 2 + 3? Smart horse! It was later found, though, that\nHans couldn’t do math at all. He was just responding to tiny cues from his handlers,\nmaybe their facial expressions would tense as he got close to the right answer, or they\nwould exhale when he tapped the right number. Clever Hans demonstrates that while we might\nthink of language as something we experience mainly through our ears, we communicate meaning\nusing more than just sound frequencies. In his book \"The Expression of the Emotions\nin Man and Animals\", Charles Darwin argued that the way that we outwardly express and\ninterpret emotions evolved from animals, and that our ability to recognize fear, happiness,\nsadness, even across species, is universal, and innate. It’s something that we’re\nborn with. Today, scientists are still debating whether\nDarwin was right, but recent research suggests that we do share one special bit of emotional\nintuition with our canine companions. Dogs are the only non-primate animals that\nseek out eye contact with humans. Their wolf ancestors, even tame ones, although they’re\nclose enough genetically to interbreed with dogs, won’t look us in the eye… which\nis why you can never, ever trust a wolf. \"How am I doing?\" When reading emotions in other people we tend\nto look disproportionately and unconsciously to the right side of their face.\nDogs share this so-called left-gaze bias, but only when looking at human faces, not\nwhen they look at other dogs. It seems like they genuinely want to understand what we’re\ntelling them and what it means. We seem to understand them too, or at least\nwe think we do. Researchers in Hungary tested people’s ability to interpret the meaning\nof recorded dog barks, and found that many people really can speak dog. What do you think this bark means?\n[barking] [barking]\nOkay, that dog's angry. That's pretty easy. What about this one?\n[barking] [barking]\nOkay, that dog wants to go for a walk. One more.\n[strange noises] I have no idea what that means. If you think about it, this dog-human language\nconnection makes a lot of sense. We've co-evolved with these creatures for the past 10,000 years\nor so. We've molded them from wolves into puppies with our hands and our brains, and\nour voices. Even if we don't always understand each other,\nwell, they're always there to listen, and that's the real meaning of a best friend.\nIsn't it buddy? [phone ringing] Wait a second. Sorry. Hello? Um, yeah, sure. It's for you. \"Hello? This is Oliver.\"\n\"Hello. This is dog.\" \"Oh, hey Luna!\"\n\"Have you seen Vanessa? She's been out for hours! I miss her.\"\n\"Ruh roh!\" Um, thanks Luna!

{"page": 29, "lesson": 4, "title": "What happens during a stroke? - Vaibhav Goswami", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-happens-during-a-stroke-vaibhav-goswami", "transcript": {"en": "Every two seconds, someone somewhere \nin the world experiences a stroke. And one out of every six people will have \none at some point in their lives. Strokes deprive brain cells of oxygen and are one of the most \ncommon causes of death and a leading cause \nof preventable disability. When someone experiences a stroke,\nquick medical care is critical, and can often help avoid \npermanent brain damage. But what causes strokes \nin the first place? And what can doctors do to treat them? The brain makes up just 2% \nof your body’s mass but consumes more than 20%\nof the oxygen in your blood. That oxygen is carried to the brain\nthrough a system of arteries. Carotid arteries supply \nthe front of the brain, and vertebral arteries supply the back. These are connected to each other, and divide into smaller \nand smaller vessels that get billions of neurons \nthe oxygen they need. If the blood flow is interrupted, \noxygen delivery stops and brain cells die. There are two ways this can happen. Hemorrhagic strokes are when a perforated\nvessel allows blood to leak out. But the more common type \nis the ischemic stroke, when a clot blocks a vessel \nand brings blood flow to a halt. Where do these clots come from? On rare occasions,\na sudden change in heart rhythm prevents the upper chambers of the heart\nfrom contracting normally. This slows down blood flow, allowing platelets, clotting factors, \nand fibrin to stick together. The clot can be carried up towards the arteries\nand blood vessels supplying the brain until it gets to one \nit can’t squeeze through. This is called an embolism and it cuts off the oxygen supply \nto all the cells downstream. The brain doesn't have pain receptors,\nso you can't feel the blockage itself. But oxygen deprivation \nslows brain function and can have sudden, noticeable effects. For example, if the affected area \nis responsible for speech, an individual’s words may be slurred. If the stroke affects a part of the brain \nthat controls muscle movement, it can cause weakness, \noften just on one side of the body. When this happens, the body \nwill immediately try to compensate by diverting blood flow \nto the affected area, but this isn’t a perfect solution. Eventually, the oxygen-deprived cells \nwill start to die, leading to brain damage \nthat may be severe or permanent. That’s why it’s important to get\nmedical care as fast as possible. The first line of treatment\nis an intravenous medication called Tissue Plasminogen Activator, which can break up the blood clot and allow blood to flow again\nin the compromised artery. If it’s delivered within a few hours, this medication greatly increases\nthe chance of surviving the stroke and avoiding permanent consequences. If Tissue Plasminogen Activator\ncannot be given because the patient \nis on certain medications, has history of major bleeding, or the clot is particularly large, doctors can perform a procedure\ncalled an endovascular thrombectomy. Using a fluorescent dye that illuminates \nthe blood vessels under a strong x-ray, the physician inserts a long, \nthin, flexible tube called a catheter into an artery in the leg and maneuvers\nit all the way to the blockage. A retriever is passed\nthrough this catheter. It expands and anchors into the clot \nwhen it’s just past it. The catheter then pulls the clot out \nwhen it’s removed. These treatments need to be delivered\nas soon as possible to preserve brain function, which means figuring out fast \nif someone is having a stroke. So how can you tell? Here are three quick things to try: 1. Ask the person to smile. A crooked mouth or facial drooping \ncan indicate muscle weakness. 2. Ask them to raise their arms. If one drifts downward, that arm weakness\nis also a sign of a stroke. 3. Ask them to repeat a\nsimple word or phrase. If their speech sounds\nslurred or strange, it could mean that the language area \nof their brain is oxygen-deprived. This is sometimes called the FAST test,\nand the T stands for time. If you see any of those signs, \ncall emergency services right away.

{"page": 29, "lesson": 5, "title": "Why do mirrors flip horizontally (but not vertically)?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/HAILYIAb", "transcript": {"en": "Have you ever\nwondered why mirrors appear to flip things\nhorizontally but not vertically? For example, this piece of\npaper that says food, now says doof in the mirror. With backwards\nletters, of course, but they're still right side up. How would the mirror know the x\ndirection from the y direction? Another example, if I\nraise my right hand, the mirrored me\nraises her left hand. But if I put my\nhand up in the air, she also puts her\nhand up, not down. So what's going on? My first knee jerk\nresponse is that our eyes are horizontal in our heads. But the problem with this hunch\nis that if you close one eye and look in the mirror--\ngo ahead and try it-- the text still reads backwards. Let's look again\nat the word food. When I read it, it's\nfacing me and I see \"food.\" But when I turn it toward\nthe mirror-- wait a minute. I turn it. The mirror is\nreflecting it backwards because I am presenting\nit backwards. Think of it this way, if I look\nat the word, it is facing me. When I look at it in the\nmirror, I turn it away from me. And in doing so, I\nflip it horizontally. That's why it\nappears horizontally flipped or backwards. What if instead I flipped\nit away from me like this? That's a vertical flip. And now the word is\nflipped upside down. It still reads \"food\"--\nF-O-O-D-- in the correct order, but now the letters\nare vertically flipped. So if I'm doing the flipping,\nthen the mirror is not. Take an arrow and\npoint it to the right. The reflection in the\nmirror goes to the right. Point it up, it goes up. Left, it goes left. Down, it goes down. Forward, it goes--\nwait a minute. If I point the arrow forward,\nthe reflection goes backward. So the mirror is\nflipping the image, but it's flipping it\nin the z direction. That's what's causing\nall of this confusion. When you look at your\nreflection in the mirror, it almost looks like\nyou've walked around to the other side of the mirror\nand you're facing yourself. Hey, Meg. Hey. What side is my right hand on? My left side. What side is my left hand on? My right side. Perfect. Just like a mirror. But there's one problem. Let's take a closer look\nat our mirrored hands. Mine says R. But mine says L. In a mirror image, her\nhand would say R backwards. To get Meg's hands\nto look like this, I'd have to flip her\nimage horizontally. But we said that mirrors\ndon't flip horizontally. So that's where the flip in\nthe z direction comes in. If I could take my\nbody and flip it through itself in\nthe z direction, I would get my mirror image. I know this is easier\nto see with an arrow, but I can also show it\nwith a left-handed glove. If I hold it out\nin the z direction, flipping it front to back\nwould be the same thing as turning inside out. Then, it would be a\nright-handed glove. And it would fit on the right\nhand of the me in the mirror. All I did was flip the\nglove front to back. So why do we think things\nare horizontally flipped when they're really not? We'll consider our\ndaily experiences. Most of the words we see in\nthe mirror are on t-shirts. We don't think of them\nas horizontally flipped. But that's exactly what\nwe do when we put them on. We flip them away from our\nnormal reading position. Another part of the\nproblem is that most of us are left and right symmetric. That causes you to see your\nreflection in the mirror as a normal looking\nperson facing you. To face yourself\nwithout the mirror, you'd have to turn around. And that's a horizontal flip. It's hard to see what's\nwrong with this image unless you look closely. But if you turn to face\nyourself by doing a handstand, that's a vertical flip. And it's pretty obvious\nwhat's wrong with this image, because we're not\nvertically symmetric. So to answer the\nquestion, why do mirrors appear to flip\nthings horizontally? Because you flip\nthem horizontally. So the mirror is just showing\nyou what you presented to it. Thanks for watching. [THEME MUSIC]"}, "multiple-choice": []}

That’ll change in 2026, when an unmanned spacecraft sent as\npart of NASA’s Discovery Program is scheduled to arrive. So why is NASA so interested in Psyche? Are we going to mine all that metal, \nor build a giant space magnet? Actually, the real reason \nis right under our feet. The core of the Earth is thought \nto consist of a solid nickel-iron center with a molten outer layer. But we’re prevented from studying it up\nclose by 2,800 kilometers of solid rock. The deepest we’ve been able \nto drill is 12 kilometers. Even if we could go further, the pressure at the core is three million\ntimes higher than at the surface, with a temperature \nof 5,000 degrees Celsius. Simply put, a journey to the center of\nthe Earth is out of the question for now. So scientists have had to resort \nto indirect ways of studying the core, like measuring earthquake waves \nthat pass through it, or studying minerals thought \nto have formed there. But what if the best way to study \nEarth’s inner space is by visiting outer space? After all, we have a pretty\ngood idea of how our planets formed. Dust and gas orbiting our young Sun \ncooled and collided to form a few thousand miniature bodies \nwe call planetesimals. As these continued to orbit,\nsome combined to grow larger, eventually forming our planets. Others experienced impacts \nthat broke them apart into smaller chunks– the asteroids we see today \nin the belt between Mars and Jupiter. What makes Psyche so special is that it appears \nto have been a planetesimal well on its way to becoming a planet, with a rocky exterior \nsurrounding a metal core. But its progress was cut short \nby a series of hit-and-run collisions with other planetesimals that knocked off the rocky crust \nuntil only the core remained. Experiencing that many \ndestructive collisions with no additive ones in between \nis statistically very unlikely, making Psyche an amazingly \nrare opportunity to study an exposed metallic core. To do that, NASA’s robotic orbiter \nwill be equipped with an array of advanced instruments. A spectrometer will analyze \nthe gamma rays and neutrons produced when Psyche \nis struck by cosmic rays. Each element in the periodic table releases gamma rays \nof specific wavelengths, so these measurements will tell us \nwhat elements are found on the surface. A magnetometer will measure \nPsyche’s magnetic field, allowing us to learn more about how Earth’s magnetic field \nis generated at its core. And of course, an imager will give us \na closer look at the surface than ever before. Visiting a whole new kind of world \nis exciting enough on its own. But the mission to Psyche gives us \na unique chance to discover our own planet’s innermost \nsecrets in an orbit far, far away."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What do scientists think the Psyche asteroid is?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A former moon of Mars"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The core of a planetesimal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A leftover piece of another spacecraft"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Something strange from outside the solar system"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What do scientists think the Psyche asteroid is primarily made of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gold and silver"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dust and rocks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Iron and nickel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Snow and ice"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Where is the Psyche asteroid?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Between Mars and Jupiter"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Between Earth and Mars"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Between Jupiter and Saturn"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Between Mercury and Venus"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How will scientists study the Psyche asteroid?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Land humans on it and collect samples"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Study it from orbit with instruments like cameras and spectrometers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Send a robotic probe to its surface for physical analysis"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the reason we cannot directly study the Earth’s core?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is too far beneath the Earth’s crust."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The pressure is too high."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It is too hot."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 29, "lesson": 7, "title": "The strongest predictor of how long you'll live", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/1fJ5KElL", "transcript": {"en": "Here's an intriguing fact. In the developed world, everywhere, women live an average\nof six to eight years longer than men do. Six to eight years longer. That's, like, a huge gap. In 2015, the \"Lancet\" published an article showing that men in rich countries are twice as likely to die as women are at any age. But there is one place in the world where men live as long as women. It's a remote, mountainous zone, a blue zone, where super longevity is common to both sexes. This is the blue zone in Sardinia, an Italian island in the Mediterranean, between Corsica and Tunisia, where there are six times\nas many centenarians as on the Italian mainland, less than 200 miles away. There are 10 times as many centenarians as there are in North America. It's the only place\nwhere men live as long as women. But why? My curiosity was piqued. I decided to research the science\nand the habits of the place, and I started with the genetic profile. I discovered soon enough that genes account for just\n25 percent of their longevity. The other 75 percent is lifestyle. So what does it take\nto live to 100 or beyond? What are they doing right? What you're looking at\nis an aerial view of Villagrande. It's a village at the epicenter\nof the blue zone where I went to investigate this, and as you can see, architectural beauty\nis not its main virtue, density is: tightly spaced houses, interwoven alleys and streets. It means that the villagers' lives\nconstantly intersect. And as I walked through the village, I could feel hundreds\nof pairs of eyes watching me from behind doorways and curtains, from behind shutters. Because like all ancient villages, Villagrande couldn't have survived without this structure,\nwithout its walls, without its cathedral, without its village square, because defense and social cohesion\ndefined its design. Urban priorities changed as we moved\ntowards the industrial revolution because infectious disease\nbecame the risk of the day. But what about now? Now, social isolation\nis the public health risk of our time. Now, a third of the population says they have two or fewer people to lean on. But let's go to Villagrande\nnow as a contrast to meet some centenarians. Meet Giuseppe Murinu.\nHe's 102, a supercentenarian and a lifelong resident\nof the village of Villagrande. He was a gregarious man. He loved to recount stories such as how he lived like a bird from what he could find\non the forest floor during not one but two world wars, how he and his wife,\nwho also lived past 100, raised six children\nin a small, homey kitchen where I interviewed him. Here he is with his sons\nAngelo and Domenico, both in their 70s\nand looking after their father, and who were quite frankly\nvery suspicious of me and my daughter who came along with me\non this research trip, because the flip side of social cohesion is a wariness of strangers and outsiders. But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all. He was a happy-go-lucky guy, very outgoing with a positive outlook. And I wondered: so is that what it takes\nto live to be 100 or beyond, thinking positively? Actually, no. (Laughter) Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101, the grumpiest person I have ever met. (Laughter) And he put a lie to the notion that you have to be positive\nto live a long life. And there is evidence for this. When I asked him why he lived so long, he kind of looked at me\nunder hooded eyelids and he growled, \"Nobody has to know my secrets.\" (Laughter) But despite being a sourpuss, the niece who lived with him\nand looked after him called him \"Il Tesoro,\" \"my treasure.\" And she respected him and loved him, and she told me, when I questioned\nthis obvious loss of her freedom, \"You just don't understand, do you? Looking after this man is a pleasure. It's a huge privilege for me. This is my heritage.\" And indeed, wherever I went\nto interview these centenarians, I found a kitchen party. Here's Giovanni with his two nieces, Maria above him and beside him his great-niece Sara, who came when I was there\nto bring fresh fruits and vegetables. And I quickly discovered by being there that in the blue zone, as people age, and indeed across their lifespans, they're always surrounded\nby extended family, by friends, by neighbors, the priest,\nthe barkeeper, the grocer. People are always there or dropping by. They are never left\nto live solitary lives. This is unlike the rest\nof the developed world, where as George Burns quipped, \"Happiness is having a large,\nloving, caring family in another city.\" (Laughter) Now, so far we've only met men, long-living men, but I met women too, and here you see Zia Teresa. She, at over 100, taught me\nhow to make the local specialty, which is called culurgiones, which are these large pasta pockets like ravioli about this size, this size, and they're filled\nwith high-fat ricotta and mint and drenched in tomato sauce. And she showed me\nhow to make just the right crimp so they wouldn't open, and she makes them\nwith her daughters every Sunday and distributes them\nby the dozens to neighbors and friends. And that's when I discovered\na low-fat, gluten-free diet is not what it takes\nto live to 100 in the blue zone. (Applause) Now, these centenarians' stories\nalong with the science that underpins them prompted me to ask myself\nsome questions too, such as, when am I going to die\nand how can I put that day off? And as you will see,\nthe answer is not what we expect. Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher\nat Brigham Young University and she addressed this very question in a series of studies of tens of thousands of middle aged people much like this audience here. And she looked at every\naspect of their lifestyle: their diet, their exercise, their marital status, how often they went to the doctor, whether they smoked or drank, etc. She recorded all of this and then she and her colleagues\nsat tight and waited for seven years to see who would still be breathing. And of the people left standing, what reduced their chances\nof dying the most? That was her question. So let's now look at her data in summary, going from the least powerful\npredictor to the strongest. OK? So clean air, which is great, it doesn't predict how long you will live. Whether you have your hypertension treated is good. Still not a strong predictor. Whether you're lean or overweight,\nyou can stop feeling guilty about this, because it's only in third place. How much exercise you get is next, still only a moderate predictor. Whether you've had a cardiac event\nand you're in rehab and exercising, getting higher now. Whether you've had a flu vaccine. Did anybody here know that having a flu vaccine\nprotects you more than doing exercise? Whether you were drinking and quit, or whether you're a moderate drinker, whether you don't smoke,\nor if you did, whether you quit, and getting towards the top predictors are two features of your social life. First, your close relationships. These are the people\nthat you can call on for a loan if you need money suddenly, who will call the doctor\nif you're not feeling well or who will take you to the hospital, or who will sit with you\nif you're having an existential crisis, if you're in despair. Those people, that little clutch of people are a strong predictor, if you have them,\nof how long you'll live. And then something that surprised me, something that's called\nsocial integration. This means how much\nyou interact with people as you move through your day. How many people do you talk to? And these mean both\nyour weak and your strong bonds, so not just the people\nyou're really close to, who mean a lot to you, but, like, do you talk to the guy\nwho every day makes you your coffee? Do you talk to the postman? Do you talk to the woman who walks\nby your house every day with her dog? Do you play bridge or poker,\nhave a book club? Those interactions\nare one of the strongest predictors of how long you'll live. Now, this leads me to the next question: if we now spend more time online\nthan on any other activity, including sleeping, we're now up to 11 hours a day, one hour more than last year, by the way, does it make a difference? Why distinguish\nbetween interacting in person and interacting via social media? Is it the same thing as being there if you're in contact constantly\nwith your kids through text, for example? Well, the short answer\nto the question is no, it's not the same thing. Face-to-face contact releases\na whole cascade of neurotransmitters, and like a vaccine,\nthey protect you now in the present and well into the future. So simply making\neye contact with somebody, shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five is enough to release oxytocin, which increases your level of trust and it lowers your cortisol levels. So it lowers your stress. And dopamine is generated,\nwhich gives us a little high and it kills pain. It's like a naturally produced morphine. Now, all of this passes\nunder our conscious radar, which is why we conflate\nonline activity with the real thing. But we do have evidence now,\nfresh evidence, that there is a difference. So let's look at some of the neuroscience. Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist\nat the University of Maryland, tried to map the difference between what goes on in our brains\nwhen we interact in person versus when we're watching\nsomething that's static. And what she did was\nshe compared the brain function of two groups of people, those interacting live with her or with one of her research associates in a dynamic conversation, and she compared that\nto the brain activity of people who were watching her talk\nabout the same subject but in a canned video, like on YouTube. And by the way, if you want to know how she fit two people\nin an MRI scanner at the same time, talk to me later. So what's the difference? This is your brain\non real social interaction. What you're seeing\nis the difference in brain activity between interacting in person\nand taking in static content. In orange, you see the brain areas\nthat are associated with attention, social intelligence -- that means anticipating\nwhat somebody else is thinking and feeling and planning -- and emotional reward. And these areas become much more engaged when we're interacting\nwith a live partner. Now, these richer brain signatures might be why recruiters\nfrom Fortune 500 companies evaluating candidates thought that the candidates were smarter when they heard their voices compared to when they just\nread their pitches in a text, for example, or an email or a letter. Now, our voices and body language\nconvey a rich signal. It shows that we're thinking, feeling, sentient human beings who are much more than an algorithm. Now, this research by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago\nBusiness School is quite amazing because\nit tells us a simple thing. If somebody hears your voice, they think you're smarter. I mean, that's quite a simple thing. Now, to return to the beginning, why do women live longer than men? And one major reason\nis that women are more likely to prioritize and groom\ntheir face-to-face relationships over their lifespans. Fresh evidence shows that these in-person friendships create a biological force field\nagainst disease and decline. And it's not just true of humans but their primate relations,\nour primate relations as well. Anthropologist Joan Silk's work\nshows that female baboons who have a core of female friends show lower levels of stress\nvia their cortisol levels, they live longer and they have\nmore surviving offspring. At least three stable relationships. That was the magic number. Think about it. I hope you guys have three. The power of such face-to-face contact is really why there are\nthe lowest rates of dementia among people who are socially engaged. It's why women who have breast cancer are four times more likely\nto survive their disease than loners are. Why men who've had a stroke\nwho meet regularly to play poker or to have coffee or to play old-timer's hockey -- I'm Canadian, after all -- (Laughter) are better protected\nby that social contact than they are by medication. Why men who've had a stroke\nwho meet regularly -- this is something very\npowerful they can do. This face-to-face contact\nprovides stunning benefits, yet now almost a quarter of the population\nsays they have no one to talk to. We can do something about this. Like Sardinian villagers, it's a biological imperative\nto know we belong, and not just the women among us. Building in-person interaction\ninto our cities, into our workplaces, into our agendas bolsters the immune system, sends feel-good hormones\nsurging through the bloodstream and brain and helps us live longer. I call this building your village, and building it and sustaining it\nis a matter of life and death. Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Susan, come back.\nI have a question for you. I'm wondering if there's a middle path. So you talk about the neurotransmitters\nconnecting when in face-to-face, but what about digital technology? We've seen enormous improvements\nin digital technology like FaceTime, things like that. Does that work too? I mean, I see my nephew. He plays Minecraft\nand he's yelling at his friends. It seems like he's connecting pretty well. Is that useful? Is that helpful? Susan Pinker: Some of the data\nare just emerging. The data are so fresh\nthat the digital revolution happened and the health data trailed behind. So we're just learning, but I would say\nthere are some improvements that we could make in the technology. For example, the camera on your laptop\nis at the top of the screen, so for example, when you're\nlooking into the screen, you're not actually making eye contact. So something as simple\nas even just looking into the camera can increase those neurotransmitters, or maybe changing\nthe position of the camera. So it's not identical, but I think\nwe are getting closer with the technology. HW: Great. Thank you so much. SP: Thank you.

Along with the Armenian genocide \nin modern-day Turkey, the Rape of Nanking in China, and Kristallnacht in Germany, another horrific ethnic cleansing campaign occurred on an island between \nthe Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The roots of this conflict \ngo back to 1492, when Christopher Columbus stumbled \nonto the Caribbean island that would come to be named Hispaniola,\nlaunching a wave of European colonization. The island’s Taíno natives were decimated \nby violence and disease and the Europeans imported large numbers\nof enslaved Africans to toil in profitable sugar plantations. By 1777, the island had become divided between a French-controlled West \nand a Spanish-controlled East. A mass slave revolt won Haiti \nits independence from France in 1804 and it became the world’s \nfirst Black republic. But the new nation paid dearly, shut out of the world economy and \nsaddled with debt by its former masters. Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic \nwould declare independence by first overthrowing Haitian rule \nof eastern Hispaniola and later Spanish \nand American colonialism. Despite the long and collaborative history\nshared by these two countries, many Dominican elites saw Haiti \nas a racial threat that imperiled political and commercial\nrelations with white western nations. In the years following World War I, the United States occupied \nboth parts of the island. It did so to secure its power \nin the Western hemisphere by destroying local opposition \nand installing US-friendly governments. The brutal and racist nature \nof the US occupation, particularly along the remote\nDominican-Haitian border, laid the foundation for bigger atrocities \nafter its withdrawal. In 1930, liberal Dominican president \nHoracio Vásquez was overthrown by the chief of his army, \nRafael Trujillo. Despite being a quarter Haitian himself, Trujillo saw the presence of a bicultural \nHaitian and Dominican borderland as both a threat to his power and an escape route \nfor political revolutionaries. In a chilling speech on October 2, 1937, he left no doubt about his intentions \nfor the region. Claiming to be protecting Dominican\nfarmers from theft and incursion, Trujillo announced the killing \nof 300 Haitians along the border and promised that this so-called \"remedy\" \nwould continue. Over the next few weeks, \nthe Dominican military, acting on Trujillo’s orders, murdered thousands of Haitian men \nand women, and even their Dominican-born children. The military targeted Black Haitians, even though many Dominicans themselves \nwere also dark-skinned. Some accounts say that to distinguish\nthe residents of one country from the other, the killers forced their victims \nto say the Spanish word for parsley. Dominicans pronounce it perejil, \nwith a trilled Spanish \"r.\" The primary Haitian language, however,\nis Kreyol, which doesn’t use a trilled r. So if people struggled to say perejil, they were judged to be Haitian \nand immediately killed. Yet recent scholarship suggests \nthat tests like this weren’t the sole factor used to determine\nwho would be murdered, especially because many of the border \nresidents were bilingual. The Dominican government censored\nany news of the massacre, while bodies were thrown in ravines, dumped in rivers, or burned to dispose of the evidence. This is why no one knows exactly \nhow many people were murdered, though contemporary estimates \nrange from about 4,000 to 15,000. Yet the extent of the carnage \nwas clear to many observers. As the US Ambassador to \nthe Dominican Republic at the time noted, “The entire northwest of the frontier\non the Dajabón side is absolutely devoid of Haitians. Those not slain either fled across the\nfrontier or are still hiding in the bush.” The government tried \nto disclaim responsibility and blame the killings \non vigilante civilians, but Trujillo was condemned \ninternationally. Eventually, the Dominican government was forced to pay only $525,000 \nin reparations to Haiti, but due to corrupt bureaucracy, barely any of these funds reached \nsurvivors or their families. Neither Trujillo nor anyone \nin his government was ever punished for this crime \nagainst humanity. The legacy of the massacre remains \na source of tension between the two countries. Activists on both sides of the border \nhave tried to heal the wounds of the past. But the Dominican state has done little, \nif anything, to officially commemorate \nthe massacre or its victims. Meanwhile, the memory of the Haitian\nmassacre remains a chilling reminder of how power-hungry leaders\ncan manipulate people into turning against \ntheir lifelong neighbors."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which explorer first discovered the Caribbean island that became known as Hispaniola?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Magellan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Columbus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Trujillo"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vasquez"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "By 1777, the island of Hispaniola was divided between which two countries?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spain and France"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Spain and the United States"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chile and Spain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Dominican Republic and France"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "After World War I, which country occupied both sides of the island of Hispaniola?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "France"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chile"}, {"label": "D", "text": "United States"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In 1937, Trujillo, despite being one-quarter Haitian himself, saw a Haitian-Dominican border as _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A threat to himself"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A peaceful barrier"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An escape route for political revolutionaries"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both a threat to himself and an escape route for political revolutionaries"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both b and c"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Approximately how many Haitians were massacred?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "300"}, {"label": "B", "text": "500"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4,000-15,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No one knows for sure"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both 4,000-15,000 and no one knows for sure are good answers"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

The good news is you've managed to locate\nthe legendary dungeon containing the stash \nof ancient Stygian coins and the eccentric wizard \nwho owns the castle has even generously\nagreed to let you have them. The bad news is that he's not\nquite as generous about letting you leave the dungeon,\nunless you solve his puzzle. The task sounds simple enough. Both faces of each coin bear\nthe fearsome scorpion crest, one in silver, one in gold. And all you have to do is separate them\ninto two piles so that each has the same number\nof coins facing silver side up. You're about to begin when all\nof the torches suddenly blow out and you're left in total darkness. There are hundreds \nof coins in front of you and each one feels the same on both sides. You try to remember \nwhere the silver-facing coins were, but it's hopeless. You've lost track. But you do know one thing for certain. When there was still light, you counted exactly \n20 silver-side-up coins in the pile. What can you do? Are you doomed to remain in the dungeon\nwith your newfound treasure forever? You're tempted to kick the pile of coins and curse the curiosity \nthat brought you here. But at the last moment, you stop yourself. You just realized there's \na surprisingly easy solution. What is it? Pause here if you want to figure\nit out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You carefully move aside 20 coins\none by one. It doesn't matter which ones:\nany coins will do, and then flip each one of them over. That's all there is to it. Why does such a simple solution work? Well, it doesn't matter how many\ncoins there are to start with. What matters is that only 20\nof the total are facing silver side up. When you take 20 coins in the darkness, you have no way of knowing how many\nof these silver-facing coins have ended up in your new pile. But let's suppose you got 7 of them. This means that there are 13\nsilver-facing coins left in the original pile. It also means that the other\n13 coins in your new pile are facing gold side up. So what happens when you flip\nall of the coins in the new pile over? Seven gold-facing coins and\n13 silver-facing coins to match the ones in the original pile. It turns out this works no matter how\nmany of the silver-facing coins you grab, whether it's all of them, \na few, or none at all. That's because of what's known\nas complementary events. We know that each coin only has\ntwo possible options. If it's not facing silver side up,\nit must be gold side up, and vice versa, and in any combination of 20 coins, the number of gold-facing\nand silver-facing coins must add up to 20. We can prove this mathematically\nusing algebra. The number of silver-facing coins\nremaining in the original pile will always be 20 minus\nhowever many you moved to the new pile. And since your new pile also\nhas a total of 20 coins, its number of gold-facing coins will be 20 minus the amount of \nsilver-facing coins you moved. When all the coins in the new pile\nare flipped, these gold-facing coins become\nsilver-facing coins, so now the number of silver-facing\ncoins in both piles is the same. The gate swings open\nand you hurry away with your treasure before the wizard changes his mind. At the next crossroads, you flip\none of your hard-earned coins to determine the way \nto your next adventure. But before you go, we have another \nquick coin riddle for you – one that comes from this video \nsponsor’s excellent website. Here we have 8 arrangements of coins.

It’s a collection of lab-grown neurons \nand other brain tissue that scientists can use to\nlearn about full-grown human brains. And it can be grown from \na sample of your skin cells. Why would we need such a thing? Neuroscientists face a challenge: shielded by our thick skulls and\nswaddled in layers of protective tissue, the human brain is\nextremely difficult to observe in action. For centuries, scientists have tried to\nunderstand them using autopsies, animal models, and, in recent years, imaging techniques. We’ve learned a lot through \nall these methods, but they have limitations. Conditions like Alzheimer’s \nand schizophrenia, and the effect on\nthe human brain of diseases like Zika, continue to hide beyond our view,\nand our understanding. Enter brain organoids, \nwhich function like human brains but aren’t part of an organism. Each one comes from \nan undifferentiated stem cell, which is a cell that\ncan develop into any tissue in the body, from bone to brain. Scientists can make undifferentiated \nstem cells from skin cells. That means they can take a skin sample \nfrom a person with a particular condition and generate brain organoids\nfrom that person. The hardest part of growing \na brain organoid, which stumped scientists for years, was finding the perfect combination of\nsugars, proteins, vitamins, and minerals that would induce the stem cell \nto develop a neural identity. That was only discovered recently, \nin 2013. The rest of the process \nis surprisingly easy. A neural stem cell essentially \ngrows itself, similar to how a seed grows into a plant, all it needs are the brain’s equivalents \nof soil, water, and sunlight. A special gel to simulate \nembryonic tissue, a warm incubator set at body temperature, and a bit of motion to mimic blood flow. The stem cell grows into \na very small version of an early-developing human brain, complete with neurons that can connect\nto one another and make simplified neural networks. As mini brains grow, they follow \nall the steps of fetal brain development. By observing this process, \nwe can learn how our neurons develop, as well as how we end up with \nso many more of them in our cortex, the part responsible for higher cognition\nlike logic and reasoning, than other species. Being able to grow brains in the lab,\neven tiny ones, raises ethical questions, like: Can they think for themselves, \nor develop consciousness? And the answer is no, for several reasons. A brain organoid has the same tissue types\nas a full-sized brain, but isn’t organized the same way. The organoid is similar to an airplane that’s been taken apart \nand reassembled at random; you could still study the wings, \nthe engine, and other parts, but the plane could never fly. Similarly, a brain organoid allows us \nto study different types of brain tissue, but can’t think. And even if mini brains were organized \nlike a real brain, they still wouldn’t be able \nto reason or develop consciousness. A big part of what makes our brains so\nsmart is their size, and mini brains have only \nabout 100,000 neurons compared to the 86 billion \nin a full-sized brain. Scientists aren’t likely to grow larger \nbrain organoids anytime soon. Without blood vessels to feed them, their size is limited \nto one centimeter at most. Finally, mini brains aren’t able \nto interact with the outside world. We learn by interacting \nwith our environments: receiving inputs through our eyes, ears, and other \nsensory organs, and reacting in turn. The complex neural networks that underlie \nconscious thoughts and actions develop from this feedback loop. Without it, the organoids \ncan never form a functional network. There’s nothing quite like \nthe actual human brain, but mini brains are an unprecedented tool for studying everything \nfrom development to disease. With luck, these humble \norganoids can help us discover what makes the human brain unique, and maybe bring us closer \nto answering the age-old question: what makes us human?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How big is a brain organoid?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Size of a pencil"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Size of a pencil eraser"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Size of a petri dish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Size of an eyedropper"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "An undifferentiated stem cell can _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Come from skin cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Arise from only brain tissue"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Can develop into any tissue in the body"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Come from skin cells and develop into any tissue in the body"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The most difficult part of growing a brain organoid proved to be finding the right combination of _____ to induce stem cells to develop a neural identity.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sugars"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Proteins"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Vitamins"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Minerals"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Compare the neurons in a mini brain organoid to those in a full-sized human brain.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "86 billion to 100,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10 to 100 billion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100,000 to 86 billion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10 billion to 86 billion"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why can scientists not grow bigger mini organoids?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The containers are too small"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The combinations of necessary ingredients are too difficult to maintain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "There are no blood vessels to sustain it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 29, "lesson": 11, "title": "Could we cure aging during your lifetime?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/dgJ5nCY4", "transcript": {"en": "Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it. We're living longer than ever before, which is great, but an unforeseen consequence of this is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick. Getting old currently means spending more time in pain. So scientists are trying to shift the attention of the medical community from optimizing lifespans to optimizing healthspans, the part of our lives during which we're disease free. To do this, we need to attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects: aging itself. Unbeknown to most people, the science of aging has made enormous progress In the last few years, with human trials about to begin in the near future. Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are alive right now INTRO 1: senescent cells. Your cells have an expiration date. Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes. Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends. This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves we have long segments of DNA called telomeres that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces, but they shrink with every cell division. In some cells, after a number of divisions the telomeres are gone, and the cell becomes a zombie, a senescent cell. Senescent cells stay around and don't die. The older you get the more of them are inside you. They harmed tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age like diabetes and kidney failure. But what if you could kill them off? Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their senescent cells as they pleased. Older mice without senescent cells were more active. Their hearts and kidneys worked better, and they were less prone to cancer. Overall, they lived up to 30 percent longer and in better health than average mice. Since we can't genetically engineer all the cells in the human body, we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells. But how do we kill them without harming healthy cells? Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell suicide when they're damaged, but senescent cells don't. It turns out that they underproduce a protein that tells them when it's time to die. So in a late 2016 study, mice were given an injection of this protein. It killed 80 % of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no harm to healthy cells. The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair. As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments involving senescent cells and the first human trials will start soon. 2: NAD+ Cells are made of hundreds of millions of parts. They're the structures, machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen. All these parts constantly need to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt. As we age, this process becomes less effective and so parts become crumpled, bunched up, or are removed slower, or they are no longer produced in the quantities we need. One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells ourselves to look after themselves. At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20. Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases from skin cancer to Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. But NAD+ can't enter cells so we can't get it as a pill. But scientists notice that other more flexible substances could enter cells and would then turn into an NAD+ inside. In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted the multiplication of skin, brain, and muscle stem cells. They were rejuvenated, had a higher ability to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan, This even got NASA interested, which is looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic radiation on Mars missions. There are human trials being planned right now, but it's too soon to say if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan. But NAD+ is a serious candidate and could become the first human anti-aging pill. 3: stem cells Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at various places in the body and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells, but they decline as we age and so we decline too. Without new parts, human bodies break. In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared, they started to develop diseases So they took stem cells from baby mice brains and injected them directly into the brains of middle-aged mice, more specifically the hypothalamus, a polyp that's involved in regulating a lot of bodily functions. The fresh stem cells reinvigorated older brain cells by secreting micro RNAs that regulated their metabolism. After 4 months, brain and muscles worked better than those of untreated mice and on average, they lived ten percent longer. Another study took stem cells from mice embryos and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice. As a consequence, they had improved heart function, could exercise 20% longer, and weirdly enough their hair regrew faster. Conclusion What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging. It requires a complex array of different therapies. We can kill off senescent cells to clear away the junk, give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap, all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication. This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice. There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent, but they are proof of concepts. To learn more about how we can modify our own healthspan, we need human trials. We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now, and only scratched the surface of these ideas. The field of healthspan extension needs more attention and funding. If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain If you now want to support the research on aging directly, you can do so at lifespan.io, a community of people actively supporting the scientists working to cure aging.

{"page": 29, "lesson": 12, "title": "Why you should define your fears instead of your goals", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/UzQNmoGG", "transcript": {"en": "So, this happy pic of me\nwas taken in 1999. I was a senior in college, and it was right after a dance practice. I was really, really happy. And I remember exactly where I was\nabout a week and a half later. I was sitting in the back\nof my used minivan in a campus parking lot, when I decided I was going to commit suicide. I went from deciding\nto full-blown planning very quickly. And I came this close\nto the edge of the precipice. It's the closest I've ever come. And the only reason I took\nmy finger off the trigger was thanks to a few lucky coincidences. And after the fact, that's what scared me the most:\nthe element of chance. So I became very methodical\nabout testing different ways that I could manage my ups and downs, which has proven to be\na good investment. (Laughs) Many normal people might have,\nsay, six to 10 major depressive episodes in their lives. I have bipolar depression.\nIt runs in my family. I've had 50-plus at this point, and I've learned a lot. I've had a lot of at-bats, many rounds in the ring with darkness, taking good notes. So I thought rather than get up\nand give any type of recipe for success or highlight reel, I would share my recipe\nfor avoiding self-destruction, and certainly self-paralysis. And the tool I've found which has proven\nto be the most reliable safety net for emotional free fall is actually the same tool that has helped me to make\nmy best business decisions. But that is secondary. And it is ... stoicism. That sounds boring. (Laughter) You might think of Spock, or it might conjure and image like this -- (Laughter) a cow standing in the rain. It's not sad. It's not particularly happy. It's just an impassive creature taking\nwhatever life sends its way. You might not think of the ultimate\ncompetitor, say, Bill Belichick, head coach of the New England Patriots, who has the all-time NFL record\nfor Super Bowl titles. And stoicism has spread like wildfire\nin the top of the NFL ranks as a means of mental toughness\ntraining in the last few years. You might not think\nof the Founding Fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, John Adams,\nGeorge Washington to name but three students of stoicism. George Washington actually had\na play about a Stoic -- this was \"Cato, a Tragedy\" -- performed for his troops at Valley Forge\nto keep them motivated. So why would people of action\nfocus so much on an ancient philosophy? This seems very academic. I would encourage you to think\nabout stoicism a little bit differently, as an operating system for thriving\nin high-stress environments, for making better decisions. And it all started here, kind of, on a porch. So around 300 BC in Athens, someone named Zeno of Citium\ntaught many lectures walking around a painted porch, a \"stoa.\" That later became \"stoicism.\" And in the Greco-Roman world, people used stoicism\nas a comprehensive system for doing many, many things. But for our purposes, chief among them\nwas training yourself to separate what you can control\nfrom what you cannot control, and then doing exercises\nto focus exclusively on the former. This decreases emotional reactivity, which can be a superpower. Conversely, let's say\nyou're a quarterback. You miss a pass.\nYou get furious with yourself. That could cost you a game. If you're a CEO, and you fly\noff the handle at a very valued employee because of a minor infraction, that could cost you the employee. If you're a college student\nwho, say, is in a downward spiral, and you feel helpless and hopeless, unabated, that could cost you your life. So the stakes are very, very high. And there are many tools\nin the toolkit to get you there. I'm going to focus on one\nthat completely changed my life in 2004. It found me then because of two things: a very close friend, young guy, my age,\ndied of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly, and then my girlfriend, who I thought\nI was going to marry, walked out. She'd had enough, and she didn't\ngive me a Dear John letter, but she did give me this, a Dear John plaque. (Laughter) I'm not making this up. I've kept it. \"Business hours are over at five o'clock.\" She gave this to me\nto put on my desk for personal health, because at the time, I was working\non my first real business. I had no idea what I was doing.\nI was working 14-plus hour days, seven days a week. I was using stimulants to get going. I was using depressants\nto wind down and go to sleep. It was a disaster. I felt completely trapped. I bought a book on simplicity\nto try to find answers. And I did find a quote\nthat made a big difference in my life, which was, \"We suffer more often\nin imagination than in reality,\" by Seneca the Younger, who was a famous Stoic writer. That took me to his letters, which took me to the exercise, \"premeditatio malorum,\" which means the pre-meditation of evils. In simple terms, this is visualizing the worst-case\nscenarios, in detail, that you fear, preventing you from taking action, so that you can take action\nto overcome that paralysis. My problem was monkey mind --\nsuper loud, very incessant. Just thinking my way\nthrough problems doesn't work. I needed to capture my thoughts on paper. So I created a written exercise that I called \"fear-setting,\"\nlike goal-setting, for myself. It consists of three pages. Super simple. The first page is right here. \"What if I ...?\" This is whatever you fear, whatever is causing you anxiety, whatever you're putting off. It could be asking someone out, ending a relationship, asking for a promotion,\nquitting a job, starting a company. It could be anything. For me, it was taking\nmy first vacation in four years and stepping away from my business\nfor a month to go to London, where I could stay\nin a friend's room for free, to either remove myself\nas a bottleneck in the business or shut it down. In the first column, \"Define,\" you're writing down all of the worst\nthings you can imagine happening if you take that step. You want 10 to 20. I won't go through all of them,\nbut I'll give you two examples. One was, I'll go to London,\nit'll be rainy, I'll get depressed, the whole thing will be\na huge waste of time. Number two, I'll miss\na letter from the IRS, and I'll get audited or raided or shut down or some such. And then you go to the \"Prevent\" column. In that column, you write\ndown the answer to: What could I do to prevent\neach of these bullets from happening, or, at the very least, decrease\nthe likelihood even a little bit? So for getting depressed in London, I could take a portable blue light with me and use it for 15 minutes in the morning. I knew that helped stave off\ndepressive episodes. For the IRS bit, I could change\nthe mailing address on file with the IRS so the paperwork would go to my accountant instead of to my UPS address. Easy-peasy. Then we go to \"Repair.\" So if the worst-case scenarios happen, what could you do to repair\nthe damage even a little bit, or who could you ask for help? So in the first case, London, well, I could fork over some money,\nfly to Spain, get some sun -- undo the damage, if I got into a funk. In the case of missing\na letter from the IRS, I could call a friend who is a lawyer or ask, say, a professor of law what they would recommend, who I should talk to,\nhow had people handled this in the past. So one question to keep in mind\nas you're doing this first page is: Has anyone else in the history of time less intelligent or less driven figured this out? Chances are, the answer is \"Yes.\" (Laughter) The second page is simple: What might be the benefits\nof an attempt or a partial success? You can see we're playing up the fears and really taking a conservative\nlook at the upside. So if you attempted whatever\nyou're considering, might you build confidence,\ndevelop skills, emotionally, financially, otherwise? What might be the benefits\nof, say, a base hit? Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this. Page three. This might be the most important,\nso don't skip it: \"The Cost of Inaction.\" Humans are very good at considering\nwhat might go wrong if we try something new,\nsay, ask for a raise. What we don't often consider\nis the atrocious cost of the status quo -- not changing anything. So you should ask yourself, if I avoid this action or decision and actions and decisions like it, what might my life look like in,\nsay, six months, 12 months, three years? Any further out, it starts\nto seem intangible. And really get detailed --\nagain, emotionally, financially, physically, whatever. And when I did this, it painted\na terrifying picture. I was self-medicating, my business was going to implode\nat any moment at all times, if I didn't step away. My relationships were fraying or failing. And I realized that inaction\nwas no longer an option for me. Those are the three pages. That's it.\nThat's fear-setting. And after this, I realized\nthat on a scale of one to 10, one being minimal impact,\n10 being maximal impact, if I took the trip, I was risking a one to three of temporary\nand reversible pain for an eight to 10 of positive,\nlife-changing impact that could be a semi-permanent. So I took the trip. None of the disasters came to pass. There were some hiccups, sure. I was able to extricate myself\nfrom the business. I ended up extending that trip\nfor a year and a half around the world, and that became the basis\nfor my first book, that leads me here today. And I can trace all of my biggest wins and all of my biggest disasters averted back to doing fear-setting at least once a quarter. It's not a panacea. You'll find that some of your fears\nare very well-founded. (Laughter) But you shouldn't conclude that without first putting them\nunder a microscope. And it doesn't make all the hard times,\nthe hard choices, easy, but it can make a lot of them easier. I'd like to close with a profile\nof one of my favorite modern-day Stoics. This is Jerzy Gregorek. He is a four-time world champion\nin Olympic weightlifting, political refugee, published poet, 62 years old. He can still kick my ass and probably\nmost asses in this room. He's an impressive guy. I spent a lot of time\non his stoa, his porch, asking life and training advice. He was part of the Solidarity in Poland, which was a nonviolent\nmovement for social change that was violently suppressed\nby the government. He lost his career as a firefighter. Then his mentor, a priest,\nwas kidnapped, tortured, killed and thrown into a river. He was then threatened. He and his wife had to flee Poland,\nbounce from country to country until they landed in the US\nwith next to nothing, sleeping on floors. He now lives in Woodside, California,\nin a very nice place, and of the 10,000-plus people\nI've met in my life, I would put him in the top 10, in terms of success and happiness. And there's a punchline coming,\nso pay attention. I sent him a text a few weeks ago, asking him: Had he ever read\nany Stoic philosophy? And he replied with two pages of text. This is very unlike him.\nHe is a terse dude. (Laughter) And not only was he familiar\nwith stoicism, but he pointed out, for all\nof his most important decisions, his inflection points, when he stood up\nfor his principles and ethics, how he had used stoicism\nand something akin to fear-setting, which blew my mind. And he closed with two things. Number one: he couldn't imagine\nany life more beautiful than that of a Stoic. And the last was his mantra,\nwhich he applies to everything, and you can apply to everything: \"Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.\" The hard choices -- what we most fear doing, asking, saying -- these are very often exactly\nwhat we most need to do. And the biggest challenges\nand problems we face will never be solved\nwith comfortable conversations, whether it's in your own head\nor with other people. So I encourage you to ask yourselves: Where in your lives right now might defining your fears be more\nimportant than defining your goals? Keeping in mind all the while,\nthe words of Seneca: \"We suffer more often\nin imagination than in reality.\" Thank you very much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Gress", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/who-s-at-risk-for-colon-cancer-amit-h-sachdev-and-frank-g-gress", "transcript": {"en": "If you were to lay your digestive tract\nout in a straight line, it would form a tube \nspanning nearly ten meters. The last 1.5 meters of that\nare called the colon, or large intestine. Cells in this organ's lining \nconstantly renew themselves, but the genes that moderate this process\noccasionally go awry, leading to the excessive growth \nof new cells. That results in small growths\nor abnormal clumps of cells called polyps. The majority of these polyps \nwon't do any harm, but some can become cancerous\nwhen their cells begin to grow and divide rapidly, projecting further into the colon. At that point, they can transform\ninto colon cancer, one of the most prevalent and\npreventable forms of cancer in the world. That's a slow process: though growth times vary, it often takes around ten years\nfor a small polyp to grow and develop into a cancerous one. We don't know exactly what causes the majority of colon polyps \nand colon cancers. We do know in general that colon cancer\ninvolves the activation of what's called oncogenes in the polyp, and/or the loss of tumor-suppressor genes\nthat usually keep cancer cells in check. Most cells have proto-oncogenes\nthat help them grow. When a proto-oncogene mutates,\nor there are two many copies of it, it can become a permanently \nactive oncogene with cells that grow out of control. While we don't yet know exactly what\nunderlying factors cause these changes, experts suspect a combination\nof both environmental and inherited genetic factors. In the worst cases, when cells within\npolyps divide and spread unchecked, they eventually break through\nthe lining of the colon. Lymph and blood vessels carry\nthose cells all over the body, and they can go on to form tumors. Despite these challenges,\nthere's a solution. We've become extremely good at\ndetecting and removing offending polyps before they can cause cancer. This happens through a process\ncalled screening, and when we do it regularly,\nwe can prevent many cases of colon cancer. So, who's at risk? Most cases occur in people \naged 50 years or older. This group is considered at average risk\nfor colon cancer or colon polyps. There's also a higher risk group\nthat includes people with personal or family histories \nof colon polyps or cancer, and those who suffer \nfrom inherited genetic syndromes, or inflammatory diseases, like Crohn’s disease \nand ulcerative colitis. So the best age to initiate screening\nvaries from person to person. If you have access to healthcare, it's best to consult a doctor\nto find out when you should begin. Screening can be done with various tests. Colonoscopy involves \na long, thin, flexible tube that's fitted with a video camera\nand light at the end and placed internally to examine\nthe colon for polyps. If polyps are found, a doctor\ncan do a polypectomy, a procedure that removes polyps\nfrom the colonic wall. Doctors can also then test\nthe polyp for cancerous cells. Colonoscopy is the only test that can\nbe used to both find and remove polyps. There are, however, \nother useful screening tests, including imaging and at-home tests that can allow patients to examine their stool \nfor small amounts of blood. Occasionally, polyps are too large\nto be removed during a colonoscopy, in which case, the next step is surgery. If blood and imaging tests then reveal that cancerous cells \nhave spread outside the colon, then a special treatment,\nlike chemotherapy, may also be required to stop\nthe cancer from escalating.

But several days in, \nsomething went terribly wrong. The transmissions stopped. Pathfinder was, in effect, \nprocrastinating: keeping itself fully occupied \nbut failing to do its most important work. What was going on? There was a bug, it turned out, \nin its scheduler. Every operating system has something \ncalled the scheduler that tells the CPU how long\nto work on each task before switching, and what to switch to. Done right, computers move so fluidly \nbetween their various responsibilities, they give the illusion \nof doing everything simultaneously. But we all know what happens\nwhen things go wrong. This should give us, if nothing else, \nsome measure of consolation. Even computers get overwhelmed sometimes. Maybe learning about the computer science \nof scheduling can give us some ideas about our own\nhuman struggles with time. One of the first insights is that all \nthe time you spend prioritizing your work is time you aren't spending doing it. For instance, let's say when you check \nyour inbox, you scan all the messages, choosing which is the most important. Once you've dealt with that one, \nyou repeat. Seems sensible, \nbut there's a problem here. This is what's known \nas a quadratic-time algorithm. With an inbox that's twice as\nfull, these passes will take twice as long and you'll need to do \ntwice as many of them! This means four times the work. The programmers \nof the operating system Linux encountered a similar problem in 2003. Linux would rank every single \none of its tasks in order of importance, and sometimes spent more time \nranking tasks than doing them. The programmers’ counterintuitive solution\nwas to replace this full ranking with a limited number \nof priority “buckets.” The system was less precise \nabout what to do next but more than made up for it \nby spending more time making progress. So with your emails, insisting on always \ndoing the very most important thing first could lead to a meltdown. Waking up to an inbox three times fuller \nthan normal could take nine times longer to clear. You’d be better off replying \nin chronological order, or even at random! Surprisingly, sometimes giving up \non doing things in the perfect order may be the key to getting them done. Another insight that emerges \nfrom computer scheduling has to do with one of the most prevalent \nfeatures of modern life: interruptions. When a computer goes \nfrom one task to another, it has to do what's called \na context switch, bookmarking its place in one task, moving old data out of its memory \nand new data in. Each of these actions comes at a cost. The insight here is that there’s \na fundamental tradeoff between productivity and responsiveness. Getting serious work done \nmeans minimizing context switches. But being responsive means reacting \nanytime something comes up. These two principles \nare fundamentally in tension. Recognizing this tension allows us to decide where \nwe want to strike that balance. The obvious solution \nis to minimize interruptions. The less obvious one is to group them. If no notification \nor email requires a response more urgently than once an hour, say, then that’s exactly how often \nyou should check them. No more. In computer science, this idea goes by \nthe name of interrupt coalescing. Rather than dealing with \nthings as they come up – Oh, the mouse was moved? A key was pressed? More of that file downloaded? – the system groups these \ninterruptions together based on how long they can afford to wait. In 2013, interrupt coalescing triggered a massive improvement \nin laptop battery life. This is because deferring interruptions \nlets a system check everything at once, then quickly re-enter a low-power state. As with computers, so it is with us. Perhaps adopting a similar approach might allow us users \nto reclaim our own attention, and give us back one of the things\nthat feels so rare in modern life: rest."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Following a quadratic-time algorithm, how long would it take to answer your emails on a day when you have four times as many messages as you do on a typical day?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2 times longer than normal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4 times longer than normal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "8 times longer than normal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "16 times longer than normal"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In 2003, the Linux team replaced their scheduler with a new one that _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ran in exponential time"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Used a \"round-robin\" algorithm"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Had a fixed number of priority levels"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sorted every task in order of priority"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Frequent interruptions will slow down a computer because _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The CPU will begin to overheat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Network latencies will increase"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It will perform additional context switches"}, {"label": "D", "text": "d.

D'Orsogna", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-animals-form-swarms-maria-r-d-orsogna", "transcript": {"en": "When desert locusts are well fed,\nthey're solitary creatures. But when food becomes scarce, hungry, desperate locusts\ncrowd onto small patches of land where they can still find \nsomething to eat. Contact between different locusts'\nhind legs set off a slew of reactions that change their appearance and behavior. Now, instead of shunning their peers,\nthey seek each other out. The locusts eventually start marching\nand then fly away in large numbers seeking a better habitat. These gigantic swarms can host\nmillions of insects and travel thousands of miles, devastating vegetation and crops. They stay close to each other,\nbut not too close, or they might get eaten\nby their hungry neighbors. When many individual organisms, like locusts, bacteria, anchovies, or bats, come together and move \nas one coordinated entity, that's a swarm. From a handful of birds \nto billions of insects, swarms can be almost any size. But what they have in common\nis that there's no leader. Members of the swarm interact\nonly with their nearest neighbors or through indirect cues. Each individual follows simple rules: Travel in the same direction \nas those around you, stay close, and avoid collisions. There are many benefits to traveling\nin a group like this. Small prey may fool predators\nby assembling into a swarm that looks like a much bigger organism. And congregating in a large group reduces the chance that any single \nindividual will be captured. Moving in the same direction\nas your neighbors saves energy by sharing the effort\nof fighting wind or water resistance. It may even be easier \nto find a mate in a swarm. Swarming can also allow groups of animals to accomplish tasks \nthey couldn’t do individually. When hundreds or millions or organisms\nfollow the same simple rules, sophisticated behavior called\nswarm intelligence may arise. A single ant can't do much on its own, but an ant colony \ncan solve complex problems, like building a nest and finding the shortest path\nto a food source. But sometimes, things can go wrong. In a crowd, diseases spread more easily, and some swarming organisms may start\neating each other if food is scarce. Even some of the benefits of swarms,\nlike more efficient navigation, can have catastrophic consequences. Army ants are one example. They lay down chemicals called pheromones which signal their neighbors \nto follow the trail. This is good if the head of the group\nis marching towards a food source. But occasionally the ants in the front\ncan veer off course. The whole swarm can get caught\nin a loop following the pheromone trail until they die of exhaustion. Humans are notoriously individualistic,\nthough social, animals. But is there anything we can learn\nfrom collective swarm-based organization? When it comes to technology,\nthe answer is definitely yes. Bats can teach drones how to navigate\nconfined spaces without colliding, fish can help design software\nfor safer driving, and insects are inspiring robot teams that\ncan assist search and rescue missions. For swarms of humans, \nit's perhaps more complicated and depends on the motives and leadership. Swarm behavior in human populations can\nsometimes manifest as a destructive mob.

These are just some of the stories\nfrom The Histories by Herodotus, an Ancient Greek writer from\nthe 5th century BCE. Not all the events in the text \nmay have happened exactly as Herodotus reported them, but this work revolutionized\nthe way the past was recorded. Before Herodotus, the past was documented\nas a list of events with little or no attempt to explain\ntheir causes beyond accepting things\nas the will of the gods. Herodotus wanted a deeper,\nmore rational understanding, so he took a new approach: looking at events from both sides\nto understand the reasons for them. Though he was Greek, Herodotus's\nhometown of Halicarnassus was part of the Persian Empire. He grew up during a series of wars\nbetween the powerful Persians and the smaller Greeks, and decided to find out all he could\nabout the subject. In Herodotus's telling, the Persian Wars\nbegan in 499 BCE, when the Athenians assisted a rebellion\nby Greeks living under Persian rule. In 490, the Persian King, Darius,\nsent his army to take revenge on Athens. But at the Battle of Marathon,\nthe Athenians won an unexpected victory. Ten years later, the Persians returned,\nplanning to conquer the whole of Greece under the leadership \nof Darius's son, Xerxes. According to Herodotus,\nwhen Xerxes arrived, his million man army was initially\nopposed by a Greek force led by 300 Spartans at the mountain pass\nof Thermopylae. At great cost to the Persians, the Spartans and their king, Leonidas,\nwere killed. This heroic defeat has been an inspiration\nto underdogs ever since. A few weeks later, the Greek navy\ntricked the Persian fleet into fighting in a narrow sea channel\nnear Athens. The Persians were defeated and Xerxes\nfled, never to return. To explain how these wars broke out\nand why the Greeks triumphed, Herodotus collected stories\nfrom all around the Mediterranean. He recorded the achievements of both\nGreeks and non-Greeks before they were lost\nto the passage of time. The Histories opens \nwith the famous sentence: \"Herodotus, of Halicarnassus, \nhere displays his inquiries.\" By framing the book as an “inquiry,” Herodotus allowed it to contain \nmany different stories, some serious, others less so. He recorded the internal debates\nof the Persian court but also tales of Egyptian flying snakes and practical advice \non how to catch a crocodile. The Greek word for this method\nof research is \"autopsy,\" meaning \"seeing for oneself.\" Herodotus was the first writer\nto examine the past by combining the different kinds\nof evidence he collected: opsis, or eyewitness accounts, akoe, or hearsay, and ta legomena, or tradition. He then used gnome, or reason, to reach conclusions \nabout what actually happened. Many of the book's early readers\nwere actually listeners. The Histories was originally written\nin 28 sections, each of which took about \nfour hours to read aloud. As the Greeks increased in influence\nand power, Herodotus's writing and the idea of history\nspread across the Mediterranean. As the first proper historian,\nHerodotus wasn't perfect. On occasions, he favored\nthe Greeks over the Persians and was too quick to believe\nsome of the stories that he heard, which made for inaccuracies. However, modern evidence \nhas actually explained some of his apparently extreme claims. For instance, there's a species \nof marmot in the Himalayas that spreads gold dust while digging. The ancient Persian word for marmot\nis quite close to the word for ant, so Herodotus may have just fallen prey\nto a translation error. All in all, for someone who was writing\nin an entirely new style, Herodotus did remarkably well. History, right down to the present day, \nhas always suffered from the partiality and mistakes of historians.

This massive scale of fossil fuel \ndependence pollutes the Earth and it won't last forever. Scientists estimate that we've consumed\nabout 40% of the world's oil. According to present estimates, at this rate, we'll run out of oil\nand gas in 50 years or so, and in about a century for coal. On the flip side, we have abundant\nsun, water, and wind. These are renewable energy sources, meaning that we won't use them up\nover time. What if we could exchange \nour fossil fuel dependence for an existence based \nsolely on renewables? We've pondered that question for decades, and yet, renewable energy still\nonly provides about 13% of our needs. That's because reaching 100% requires\nrenewable energy that's inexpensive and accessible. This represents a huge challenge, even if we ignore the politics involved\nand focus on the science and engineering. We can better understand the problem\nby understanding how we use energy. Global energy use is a diverse \nand complex system, and the different elements \nrequire their own solutions. But for now, we'll focus on two\nof the most familiar in everyday life: electricity and liquid fuels. Electricity powers blast furnaces, \nelevators, computers, and all manner of things in homes,\nbusinesses, and manufacturing. Meanwhile, liquid fuels \nplay a crucial role in almost all forms of transportation. Let's consider the electrical \nportion first. The great news is that our technology\nis already advanced enough to capture all that energy \nfrom renewables, and there's an ample supply. The sun continuously radiates about 173 quadrillion watts \nof solar energy at the Earth, which is almost 10,000 times\nour present needs. It's been estimated that a surface that\nspans several hundred thousand kilometers would be needed to power humanity\nat our present usage levels. So why don't we build that? Because there are other \nhurdles in the way, like efficiency and energy transportation. To maximize efficiency, solar plants must be located in areas \nwith lots of sunshine year round, like deserts. But those are far away \nfrom densely populated regions where energy demand is high. There are other forms of renewable energy\nwe could draw from, such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomasses, but they also have limits based on\navailability and location. In principle, a connected electrical\nenergy network with power lines crisscrossing the globe would enable us to transport power\nfrom where it's generated to where it's needed. But building a system on this scale\nfaces an astronomical price tag. We could lower the cost by developing\nadvanced technologies to capture energy more efficiently. The infrastructure for transporting energy\nwould also have to change drastically. Present-day power lines lose about 6-8%\nof the energy they carry because wire material dissipates energy\nthrough resistance. Longer power lines would mean\nmore energy loss. Superconductors could be one solution. Such materials can transport electricity\nwithout dissipation. Unfortunately, they only work\nif cooled to low temperatures, which requires energy \nand defeats the purpose. To benefit from that technology, we'd need to discover \nnew superconducting materials that operate at room temperature. And what about the all-important,\noil-derived liquid fuels? The scientific challenge there is to store\nrenewable energy in an easily transportable form. Recently, we've gotten better\nat producing lithium ion batteries, which are lightweight \nand have high-energy density. But even the best of these\nstore about 2.5 megajoules per kilogram. That's about 20 times less than the energy\nin one kilogram of gasoline. To be truly competitive, car batteries\nwould have to store much more energy without adding cost. The challenges only increase \nfor bigger vessels, like ships and planes. To power a cross-Atlantic \nflight for a jet, we'd need a battery weighing\nabout 1,000 tons. This, too, demands a technological leap\ntowards new materials, higher energy density, and better storage. One promising solution would be\nto find efficient ways to convert solar into chemical energy. This is already happening in labs, but the efficiency is still too low\nto allow it to reach the market. To find novel solutions, we'll need\nlots of creativity, innovation, and powerful incentives. The transition towards all-renewable \nenergies is a complex problem involving technology, \neconomics, and politics. Priorities on how to tackle this challenge\ndepend on the specific assumptions we have to make when trying to solve\nsuch a multifaceted problem. But there's ample reason to be optimistic\nthat we'll get there. Top scientific minds around the world\nare working on these problems and making breakthroughs all the time.

What will these curious searchers\nfind of us? They will find what geologists, \nscientists, and other experts are increasingly calling\nthe Anthropocene, or new age of mankind. The impacts that we humans make\nhave become so pervasive, profound, and permanent that some geologists argue\nwe merit our own epoch. That would be a new unit\nin the geologic time scale that stretches back \nmore than 4.5 billion years, or ever since the Earth took shape. Modern humans may be on par\nwith the glaciers behind various ice ages or the asteroid that doomed\nmost of the dinosaurs. What is an epoch? Most simply, it's a unit of geologic time. There's the Pleistocene, an icy epoch that saw the evolution\nof modern humans. Or there's the Eocene, \nmore than 34 million years ago, a hothouse time during which the continents drifted \ninto their present configuration. Changes in climate or fossils\nfound in the rock record help distinguish these epochs\nand help geologists tell deep time. So what will be the record \nof modern people's impact on the planet? It doesn't rely on the things\nthat may seem most obvious to us today, like sprawling cities. Even New York or Shanghai \nmay prove hard to find buried in the rocks \na million years from now. But humans have put new things\ninto the world that never existed on Earth before, like plutonium and plastics. In fact, the geologists \nknown as stratigraphers who determine the geologic timescale, have proposed a start date\nfor the Anthropocene around 1950. That’s when people started blowing\nup nuclear bombs all around the world and scattering novel elements \nto the winds. Those elements will last \nin the rock record, even in our bones and teeth\nfor millions of years. And in just 50 years, \nwe've made enough plastic, at least 8 billion metric tons, to cover the whole world in a thin film. People's farming, fishing, and forestry\nwill also show up as a before and after in any such strata because it's those kinds of activities that are causing unique species \nof plants and animals to die out. This die-off started perhaps\nmore than 40,000 years ago as humanity spread out of Africa and reached places like Australia, kicking off the disappearance\nof big, likable, and edible animals. This is true of Europe and Asia,\nthink woolly mammoth, as well as North and South America, too. For a species that has only roamed the planet for \na few hundred thousand years, Homo sapiens has had a big impact\non the future fossil record. That also means that even if people\nwere to disappear tomorrow, evolution would be driven \nby our choices to date. We're making a new homogenous world\nof certain favored plants and animals, like corn and rats. But it's a world that's not as resilient\nas the one it replaces. As the fossil record shows, it's a diversity of plants and animals that allows unique pairings \nof flora and fauna to respond to environmental challenges,\nand even thrive after an apocalypse. That goes for people, too. If the microscopic plants \nof the ocean suffer as a result of too much \ncarbon dioxide, say, we'll lose the source of as much as half\nof the oxygen we need to breathe. Then there's the smudge in future rocks. People's penchant for burning coal,\noil, and natural gas has spread tiny bits of soot\nall over the planet. That smudge corresponds \nwith a meteoric rise in the amount \nof carbon dioxide in the air, now beyond 400 parts per million, or higher than any other Homo sapiens\nhas ever breathed. Similar soot can still \nbe found in ancient rocks from volcanic fires \nof 66 million years ago, a record of the cataclysm touched\noff by an asteroid at the end of the late Cretaceous epoch.

{"page": 29, "lesson": 20, "title": "History vs. Che Guevara - Alex Gendler", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/history-vs-che-guevara-alex-gendler", "transcript": {"en": "His face is recognized all over the world. The young medical student\nwho became a revolutionary icon. But was Che Guevara \na heroic champion of the poor or a ruthless warlord \nwho left a legacy of repression? Order, order. Hey, where have I seen that guy before? Ahem, your Honor, this is Ernesto Che Guevara. In the early 1950s, he left behind a privileged life \nas a medical student in Argentina to travel through rural Latin America. The poverty and misery he witnessed\nconvinced him that saving lives required more than medicine. So he became a terrorist seeking to violently overthrow \nthe region's governments. What? The region's governments \nwere brutal oligarchies. Colonialism may have formally ended, but elites still controlled \nall the wealth. American corporations bought up land\noriginally seized from indigenous people and used it for profit and export, even keeping most of it uncultivated\nwhile locals starved. Couldn't they vote to change that? Oh, they tried, your Honor. In 1953, Che came to Guatemala under the democratically-elected \ngovernment of President Árbenz. Árbenz passed reforms to redistribute some of this uncultivated \nland back to the people while compensating the landowners. But he was overthrown \nin a CIA-sponsored coup. The military was protecting against\nthe seizure of private property and communist takeover. They were protecting corporate profits and Che saw that they would use\nthe fear of communism to overthrow any government\nthat threatened those profits. So he took the lessons of Guatemala\nwith him to Mexico. There, he met exiled Cuban revolutionaries and decided to help them \nliberate their country. You mean help Fidel Castro \nturn a vibrant Cuba into a dictatorship. Dictatorship was what Cuba \nhad before the revolution. Fulgencio Batista was a tyrant\nwho came to power in a military coup. He turned Havana into a luxury playground\nfor foreigners while keeping Cubans mired in poverty and\nkilling thousands in police crackdowns. Even President Kennedy called it\nthe worst example of \"economic colonization, humiliation,\nand exploitation in the world.\" Whatever Batista's faults, it can't compare to the totalitarian\nnightmare Castro would create. Forced labor camps, torture of prisoners,\nno freedom to speak or to leave. But this isn't the trial \nof Fidel Castro, is it? Che Guevara was instrumental in helping\nCastro seize power. As a commander in his guerilla army, he unleashed a reign of terror\nacross the countryside, killing any suspected spies or dissenters. He also helped peasants build\nhealth clinics and schools, taught them to read, and even recited poetry to them. His harsh discipline was necessary\nagainst a much stronger enemy who didn't hesitate to burn entire\nvillages suspected of aiding the rebels. Let's not forget that the new regime\nheld mass executions and killed hundreds \nof people without trial as soon as they took power in 1959. The executed were officials\nand collaborators who had tormented \nthe masses under Batista. The people supported \nthis revolutionary justice. Which people? An angry mob crying for blood\ndoes not a democracy make. And that's not even mentioning\nthe forced labor camps, arbitrary arrests, and repression of LGBT people\nthat continued long after the revolution. There's a reason people kept\nrisking their lives to flee, often with nothing but the clothes\non their backs. So was that all this Che brought to Cuba? Just another violent dictatorship? Not at all. He oversaw land redistribution, helped established universal education, and organized volunteer literacy brigades\nthat raised Cuba's literacy rate to 96%, still one of the highest in the world. Which allowed the government to control\nwhat information everyone received. Guevara's idealistic incompetence\nas Finance Minister caused massive drops in productivity when he replaced worker pay raises\nwith moral certificates. He suppressed all press freedom, declaring that newspapers \nwere instruments of the oligarchy. And it was he who urged Castro\nto host Soviet nuclear weapons, leading to the Cuban Missile Crisis that brought the world\nto the brink of destruction. He was a leader, not a bureaucrat. That's why he eventually left to spread\nthe revolution abroad. Which didn't go well. He failed to rally rebels in the Congo and went to Bolivia \neven when the Soviets disapproved. The Bolivian Government, \nwith the help of the CIA, was able to capture and neutralize\nthis terrorist in 1967, before he could do much damage. While doing plenty of damage themselves\nin the process. So that was the end of it? Not at all. As Che said, \nthe revolution is immortal. He was publicly mourned in cities\nall over the world. Not by the Cubans who managed to escape. And his story would inspire \nyoung activists for generations to come. Ha. A trendy symbol of rebellion for those\nwho never had to live under his regime. Symbols of revolution \nmay become commodified, but the idea of a more just world remains. Maybe, but I'm not sharing my coffee. Che Guevara was captured and\nexecuted by government forces in Bolivia. His remains would not be found\nfor another 30 years. But did he die a hero \nor had he already become a villain? And should revolutions be judged\nby their ideals or their outcomes?

You share the pond \nwith three other villagers. The pond starts off with a dozen fish,\nand the fish reproduce. For every two fish, there will be \none baby added each night. So, in order to maximize \nyour supply of food, how many fish should you catch each day? Take a moment to think about it. Assume baby fish grow \nto full size immediately and that the pond begins at full capacity, and ignore factors \nlike the sex of the fish you catch. The answer? One, and it's not just you. The best way to maximize \nevery villager's food supply is for each fisherman\nto take just one fish each day. Here's how the math works. If each villager takes one fish,\nthere will be eight fish left over night. Each pair of fish produces one baby, and the next day, the pond \nwill be fully restocked with twelve fish. If anyone takes more than one,\nthe number of reproductive pairs drops, and the population \nwon't be able to bounce back. Eventually, the fish in the lake \nwill be gone, leaving all four villagers to starve. This fish pond is just one example\nof a classic problem called the tragedy of the commons. The phenomenon was first described \nin a pamphlet by economist William Forster Lloyd in 1833 in a discussion of \nthe overgrazing of cattle on village common areas. More than 100 years later, ecologist\nGarrett Hardin revived the concept to describe what happens \nwhen many individuals all share a limited resource, like grazing land, fishing areas, living space, even clean air. Hardin argued that these situations\npit short-term self-interest against the common good, and they end badly for everyone, resulting in overgrazing, overfishing, overpopulation, pollution, and other social \nand environmental problems. The key feature of \na tragedy of the commons is that it provides an opportunity for\nan individual to benefit him or herself while spreading out any negative effects \nacross the larger population. To see what that means,\nlet's revisit our fish pond. Each individual fisherman is motivated to take as many fish \nas he can for himself. Meanwhile, any decline \nin fish reproduction is shared by the entire village. Anxious to avoid \nlosing out to his neighbors, a fisherman will conclude that it's in his\nbest interest to take an extra fish, or two, or three. Unfortunately, this is the same conclusion\nreached by the other fisherman, and that's the tragedy. Optimizing for the self in the short term\nisn't optimal for anyone in the long term. That's a simplified example,\nbut the tragedy of the commons plays out in the more complex systems\nof real life, too. The overuse of antibiotics has led to\nshort-term gains in livestock production and in treating common illnesses, but it's also resulted in the evolution\nof antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which threaten the entire population. A coal-fired power plant produces\ncheap electricity for its customers and profits for its owners. These local benefits are helpful\nin the short term, but pollution from mining and burning coal\nis spread across the entire atmosphere and sticks around for thousands of years. There are other examples, too. Littering, water shortages, deforestation, traffic jams, even the purchase of bottled water. But human civilization has proven it's\ncapable of doing something remarkable. We form social contracts, we make communal agreements, we elect governments, and we pass laws. All this to save our collective selves\nfrom our own individual impulses. It isn't easy, and we certainly \ndon't get it right nearly all of the time. But humans at our best have shown\nthat we can solve these problems and we can continue to do so\nif we remember Hardin's lesson.

{"page": 29, "lesson": 22, "title": "How often should you get a flu shot? - Melvin Sanicas", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-you-need-to-get-a-flu-shot-every-year-melvin-sanicas", "transcript": {"en": "All year long, researchers at hundreds\nof hospitals around the world collect samples from flu patients and send them to top virology experts\nwith one goal: to design the vaccine \nfor the next flu season. But why do we need a new one every year? Vaccines for diseases like mumps\nand rubella offer a lifetime of protection with two shots early in life. What's so special about the flu? Two factors make the flu a tough target. First, there are more than 100 subtypes\nof the influenza virus, and the ones in circulation \nchange from season to season. And second, the flu's genetic code\nallows it to mutate more quickly than many other viruses. The flu spreads by turning a host's own \ncells into viral production factories. When the virus is engulfed by a host cell,\nit expels its genetic material, which makes its way to the nucleus. There, cellular machinery that normally\ncopies the host's genes starts replicating viral genes instead, creating more and more copies\nof the virus. New viruses are repackaged \nand crammed into the cell until it bursts, sending freshly minted influenza viruses\nout to infect additional cells. Most viruses follow this script. The trick with the flu is that its genetic\nmaterial isn't DNA but a similar compound called RNA. And RNA viruses can mutate much faster. When cells synthesize DNA, a built-in proofreader recognizes \nand corrects mistakes, but the RNA synthesis mechanism\ndoesn't have this fail-safe. If errors creep in, they stick around\ncreating new variants of the virus. Why is this a problem? Because vaccines depend on recognition. The flu vaccine includes some of the same\nsubstances, called antigens, found on the surface of the virus itself. The body identifies those fragments\nas foreign and responds by producing compounds\ncalled antibodies, tailor-made to match the antigens. When a vaccinated person\nencounters the actual virus, the preprogrammed antibodies\nhelp the immune system identify the threat and mobilize quickly \nto prevent an infection. Those antigens are different \nfor every strain of influenza. If vaccination has prepared \nthe immune system for one strain, a different one may still \nbe able to sneak by. Even within the same strain of flu, those rapid genetic mutations\ncan change the surface compounds enough that the antibodies \nmay not recognize them. To make things even more complicated, sometimes two different strains combine\nto create an entirely new hybrid virus. All of this makes vaccinating for the flu like trying to hit a moving \ntransforming target. That's why scientists are constantly\ncollecting data about which strains are circulating and checking to see how much those\nstrains have mutated from previous years' versions. Twice annually, the World \nHealth Organization pulls together experts to analyze all that data, holding one meeting for each hemisphere. The scientists determine which strains\nto include in that season's vaccine, picking four for the quadrivalent vaccine\nin use today. In spite of the flu's evasive maneuvers, in recent years, the group's predictions\nhave been almost always correct. Even when flu strains mutate further,\nthe vaccine is often close enough that a vaccinated person who catches\nthe flu anyway will have a milder and shorter illness\nthan they would otherwise. Vaccination also helps protect\nother people in the community who may not be medically eligible \nfor the shot by preventing those around them\nfrom carrying the virus. This is called herd immunity. The flu shot can't give you the flu. It contains an inactivated virus\nthat isn't capable of making you sick. You might feel tired \nand achy after getting it, but that's not an infection. It's your normal immune response\nto the vaccine. Some parts of the world use, \ninstead of a shot, an inhaled vaccine that contains a weakened live virus. This is also safe for \nthe vast majority of people. Only those with impaired immune systems\nwould be at risk, but they're typically \nnot given live vaccines. Meanwhile, scientists are working\nto develop a universal flu vaccine that would protect against any strain,\neven mutated ones.

{"page": 29, "lesson": 23, "title": "Why incompetent people think they're amazing - David Dunning", "category": "Social Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-incompetent-people-think-they-re-amazing-david-dunning", "transcript": {"en": "Are you as good at things \nas you think you are? How good are you at managing money? What about reading people's emotions? How healthy are you \ncompared to other people you know? Are you better than average at grammar? Knowing how competent we are and how are skill stack up \nagainst other people's is more than a self-esteem boost. It helps us figure out when we can forge\nahead on our own decisions and instincts and when we need, instead, \nto seek out advice. But psychological research suggests\nthat we're not very good at evaluating ourselves accurately. In fact, we frequently overestimate\nour own abilities. Researchers have a name \nfor this phenomena, the Dunning-Kruger effect. This effect explains \nwhy more than 100 studies have shown that people display \nillusory superiority. We judge ourselves as better than others to a degree that violates \nthe laws of math. When software engineers at two companies\nwere asked to rate their performance, 32% of the engineers at one company\nand 42% at the other put themselves in the top 5%. In another study, 88% of American drivers described themselves \nas having above average driving skills. These aren't isolated findings. On average, people tend to rate\nthemselves better than most in disciplines ranging from health,\nleadership skills, ethics, and beyond. What's particularly interesting\nis that those with the least ability are often the most likely to overrate\ntheir skills to the greatest extent. People measurably poor \nat logical reasoning, grammar, financial knowledge, math, emotional intelligence, running medical lab tests, and chess all tend to rate their expertise almost\nas favorably as actual experts do. So who's most vulnerable to this delusion? Sadly, all of us because we all have\npockets of incompetence we don't recognize. But why? When psychologists Dunning and Kruger\nfirst described the effect in 1999, they argued that people lacking\nknowledge and skill in particular areas suffer a double curse. First, they make mistakes\nand reach poor decisions. But second, those same knowledge gaps also\nprevent them from catching their errors. In other words, poor performers lack\nthe very expertise needed to recognize how badly they're doing. For example, when the researchers studied participants in \na college debate tournament, the bottom 25% of teams \nin preliminary rounds lost nearly four \nout of every five matches. But they thought they were winning\nalmost 60%. WIthout a strong grasp \nof the rules of debate, the students simply couldn't recognize\nwhen or how often their arguments broke down. The Dunning-Kruger effect isn't a question\nof ego blinding us to our weaknesses. People usually do admit their deficits\nonce they can spot them. In one study, students who had initially\ndone badly on a logic quiz and then took a mini course on logic were quite willing to label\ntheir original performances as awful. That may be why people with a moderate\namount of experience or expertise often have less confidence\nin their abilities. They know enough to know that \nthere's a lot they don't know. Meanwhile, experts tend to be aware\nof just how knowledgeable they are. But they often make a different mistake: they assume that everyone else \nis knowledgeable, too. The result is that people, \nwhether they're inept or highly skilled, are often caught in a bubble\nof inaccurate self-perception. When they're unskilled, \nthey can't see their own faults. When they're exceptionally competent, they don't perceive how unusual \ntheir abilities are. So if the Dunning-Kruger effect \nis invisible to those experiencing it, what can you do to find out how good\nyou actually are at various things? First, ask for feedback from other people, and consider it, \neven if it's hard to hear. Second, and more important, keep learning. The more knowledgeable we become, the less likely we are to have\ninvisible holes in our competence. Perhaps it all boils down \nto that old proverb: When arguing with a fool, first make sure the other person\nisn't doing the same thing."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When it comes to their skills and abilities, people tend to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Overrate themselves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Underrate themselves"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Have roughly accurate impressions of what they can and cannot do"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "According to the Dunning-Kruger effect, people fail to recognize their deficits and shortcomings because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Other people avoid giving them negative feedback"}, {"label": "B", "text": "People refuse to acknowledge shortcomings that threaten their ego"}, {"label": "C", "text": "People fail to have the expertise necessary to recognize how bad their skills are"}, {"label": "D", "text": "People seek out flattery from other people"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Poor performers suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tend to rate their skills much more positively than experts rate theirs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tend to rate their skills almost as favorably as experts rate their own"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tend to rate their skills as way below average"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tend to rate their skills as permanent deficits that cannot change"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What’s a possible way to gain an accurate self-image?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Seek out feedback from others"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Always keep learning"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both work"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neither works"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What mistake do experts make when evaluating their skills?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They, too, overestimate their skills"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They tend to assume too much that everyone else is knowledgeable, too"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They tend to assume other people don’t know anything"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Experts forget just how quickly skills fades without practice"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

And the world's most notorious jewel thief\nalready has her eyes on the prize. Because security is tight\nand the eggs are so large, she'll only get the chance to steal one by dropping it out the window\ninto her waiting truck and repelling down \nbefore the police can arrive. All eggs are identical in weight\nand construction, but each floor's egg is more rare \nand valuable than the one below it. While the thief would naturally like\nto take the priceless egg at the top, she suspects it won't survive\na 100-story drop. Being pragmatic, she decides to settle\nfor the most expensive egg she can get. In the museum's gift shop, \nshe finds two souvenir eggs, perfect replicas \nthat are perfectly worthless. The plan is to test drop them to find the highest floor \nat which an egg will survive the fall without breaking. Of course, the experiment \ncan only be repeated until both replica eggs are smashed. And throwing souvenirs out the window\ntoo many times is probably going to draw \nthe guards' attention. What's the least number of tries\nit would take to guarantee that \nshe find the right floor? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you're having trouble getting started\non the solution, it might help to start \nwith a simpler scenario. Imagine our thief only \nhad one replica egg. She'd have a single option: To start by dropping it \nfrom the first floor and go up one by one until it breaks. Then she'd know that the floor below that is the one she needs \nto target for the real heist. But this could require \nas many as 100 tries. Having an additional replica egg\ngives the thief a better option. She can drop the first egg from different\nfloors at larger intervals in order to narrow down the range\nwhere the critical floor can be found. And once the first breaks, she can use the second egg to explore\nthat interval floor by floor. Large floor intervals don't work great. In the worst case scenario, they require\nmany tests with the second egg. Smaller intervals work much better. For example, if she starts by dropping\nthe first egg from every 10th floor, once it breaks, she'll only have to test\nthe nine floors below. That means it'll take at most\n19 tries to find the right floor. But can she do even better? After all, there's no reason \nevery interval has to be the same size. Let's say there were only ten floors. The thief could test this whole building\nwith just four total throws by dropping the first egg\nat floors four, seven, and nine. If it broke at floor four, it would take\nup to three throws of the second egg to find the exact floor. If it broke at seven, it would take up to two throws\nwith the second egg. And if it broke at floor nine, it would take just one more\nthrow of the second egg. Intuitively, what we're trying to do here\nis divide the building into sections where no matter which floor is correct, it takes up to the same number\nof throws to find it. We want each interval to be one floor\nsmaller than the last. This equation can help us solve\nfor the first floor we need to start with in the 100 floor building. There are several ways \nto solve this equation, including trial and error. If we plug in two for n,\nthat equation would look like this. If we plug in three, we get this. So we can find the first n to pass 100 by adding more terms \nuntil we get to our answer, which is 14.
