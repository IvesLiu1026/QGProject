It started with a disagreement over the \nbehavior of a militia of monks, and ended with an accusation \nof witchcraft leveled against one of the most \npowerful figures in the city. Hypatia of Alexandria was a prominent \nmathematician, philosopher, and advisor to the city’s leaders. In the centuries since she lived, the details of her life have been \nthe subject of much dispute and have taken on an almost \nmythical status. But while none of Hypatia’s \nown writings survive, her contemporaries’ and students’ \naccounts of her work and life paint a picture of the qualities that \nmade her renowned as a scholar, beloved as a teacher, and ultimately \nled to her downfall. Hypatia was born around \n355 in Alexandria, then part of the Egyptian province \nof the Eastern Roman Empire, and an intellectual center. Her father Theon was an accomplished \nGreek mathematician and astronomer; her mother is unknown. Hypatia was likely an only child, and \nTheon educated her himself. By adulthood, she had surpassed her \nfather in both mathematics and philosophy, becoming the city’s foremost scholar \nand taking over his position at the head of the Platonic school, \nsimilar to a modern university. She refined scientific instruments, \nwrote math textbooks, and developed a more efficient \nmethod of long division. But perhaps her most significant \ncontributions to intellectual life in Alexandria came through her teaching. The philosophy Hypatia taught drew \nfrom the legacy of Plato and Aristotle, as well as the mystical philosopher \nPlotinus and the mathematician Pythagoras. The convergence of these influences merged\nto form a school called Neoplatonism. For the Neoplatonists, mathematics \nhad a spiritual aspect, divided among the four branches of \narithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music. These subjects were not studied merely \nfor the sake of curiosity or practical utility, but because they \nauthenticated the belief that numbers were the sacred \nlanguage of the universe. In the repeated patterns of algebraic \nformulas and geometric shapes, the orbits of the planets, and the \nharmonious intervals of musical tones, the Neoplatonists saw a rational \ncosmic force at work. Students delved into this ordered \nmathematical world to achieve higher unity with this force, \nknown as “the One.” While Hypatia was considered pagan— a term for traditional Roman \nbelief before Christianity— she worshipped no particular \ndeity or deities, and her ideas could be applied alongside \nmultiple religious viewpoints. Jewish and Christian as well \nas pagan students travelled from the farthest reaches of \nthe empire to study with her. The nonpartisan environment \nHypatia fostered, where all students could feel comfortable, was especially remarkable given the \nreligious and political turmoil that was fracturing the city of \nAlexandria at the time. Christianity had recently become \nthe Empire’s state religion. The local archbishop Cyril had steadily \ngained political power, commanding zealous militias of Christian \nmonks to destroy pagan temples and harass the Jewish population. In doing so, he encroached on the secular\nauthority of the Roman governor Orestes, himself a moderate Christian, leading to\na bitter public feud between the two men. Because she was seen as a wise \nand impartial figure, governor Orestes consulted Hypatia, who advised him to act with \nfairness and restraint. But when a group of Cyril’s \nmonks incited a riot, badly injuring Orestes in the process, \nhe had their leader tortured to death. Cyril and his followers blamed Hypatia, accusing her of witchcraft to \nturn Orestes against Christianity. In March 415, as Hypatia was \ntraveling through the city, the bishop’s militia of monks \ndragged her from her carriage and brutally murdered and dismembered her. Hypatia’s death was a turning point \nin the politics of Alexandria. In the wake of her murder, other philosophers in the Greek \nand Roman tradition fled, and the city’s role as a center of \nlearning declined. In a very real way, the spirit of inquisition, openness, \nand fairness she fostered died with her."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which groups of students were welcome to study at Hypatia’s school?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Christians"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pagans"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Jews"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": null}, {"question": "In addition to teaching, Hypatia was highly sought after to give advice to ______ officials.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "church"}, {"label": "B", "text": "government"}, {"label": "C", "text": "tribal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "medical"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What were some of Hypatia’s accomplishments?

Air raid sirens warned citizens \nto get indoors and preceded strategic blackouts\nacross the city. But 28-year old Hisako Koyama \nsaw these blackouts as opportunities. Dragging a futon over her head \nfor protection, Koyama would gaze at the night sky, tracking all sorts \nof astronomical phenomena. However, her latest endeavor required \nthe light of day. By angling her telescope towards the sun, Koyama could project the star's\nlight onto a sheet of paper, allowing her to sketch \nthe sun’s shifting surface. She spent weeks recreating this set up,\ntracking every change she saw. But while Koyama didn't know it, these drawings were the start \nof one of the most important records of solar activity in human history. To understand exactly what Koyama\nsaw on the sun’s surface, we first need to understand \nwhat’s happening inside the star. Every second, \ntrillions of hydrogen atoms fuse into helium atoms\nin a process called nuclear fusion. This ongoing explosion maintains \nthe sun’s internal temperature of roughly 15 million degrees Celsius, which is more than enough energy \nto transform gas into churning pools of plasma. Plasma consists of charged particles \nthat produce powerful magnetic fields. But unlike the stable charged particles \nthat maintain magnetic activity on Earth, this plasma is constantly in flux, alternately disrupting and amplifying\nthe sun's magnetic field. This ongoing movement can produce temporary concentrations \nof magnetic activity which inhibit the movement of molecules \nand in turn reduce heat in that area. And since regions with less heat \ngenerate less light, places with the strongest magnetic fields\nappear as dark spots scattered across the sun’s surface. These so-called sunspots \nare always moving, both as a result of plasma \nswirling within the sphere, and the sun’s rotation. And because they’re often \nclustered together, accurately counting sunspots and tracking \ntheir movement can be a challenge, depending greatly on the perception \nand judgment of the viewer. This is precisely where Koyama’s \ncontributions would be so valuable. Despite having no\nformal training in astronomy, her observations and sketches\nwere remarkably accurate. After sending her work \nto the Oriental Astronomical Association, she received a letter of commendation for\nher dedicated and detailed observations. With their support, she began to visit \nthe Tokyo Museum of Science, where she could use a far superior\ntelescope to continue her work. Koyama soon joined the museum's staff\nas a professional observer, and over the next 40 years, \nshe worked on a daily basis, producing over 10,000 drawings\nof the sun’s surface. Researchers already knew magnetic currents\nin the sun followed an 11 year cycle that moved sunspots in a butterfly shaped \npath over the star’s surface. But using Koyama’s record, they could precisely follow \nspecific sunspots and clusters through that journey. This kind of detail offered a real-time\nindication of the sun’s magnetic activity, allowing scientists to track \nall kinds of solar phenomena, including volatile solar flares. These flares typically emanate\nfrom the vicinity of sunspots, and can travel all the way \nto Earth’s atmosphere. Here, they can create geomagnetic storms capable of disrupting long range \ncommunication and causing blackouts. Solar flares also pose a major risk \nto satellites and manned space stations, making them essential to predict \nand plan for. During an interview in 1964, Koyama lamented that her 17 years \nof observation had barely been enough to produce a single butterfly record\nof the solar cycle. But by the end of her career, \nshe’d drawn three and a half cycles— one of the longest records ever made. Better still, the quality of her\ndrawings was so consistent, researchers used them as a baseline \nto reconstruct the past 400 years of sunspot activity\nfrom various historical sources. This project extends Koyama’s legacy\nfar beyond her own lifetime, and proves that science is not built\nsolely on astounding discoveries, but also on careful observation\nof the world around us."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the reason for the rolling blackouts during which Koyama would stargaze?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Reducing visibility for air raids"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Damage sustained to the power grid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Energy and fuel shortages"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How did Koyama get her position at the Tokyo Museum of Science?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "She got a PhD in astronomy."}, {"label": "B", "text": "She took an intensive training course."}, {"label": "C", "text": "She sent unsolicited sketches of sunspots to the astronomical association."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What causes sunspots?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Volcanic eruptions on the sun"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fluctuations in the sun’s magnetic activity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "UFOs passing in front of the sun"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How long does the ‘butterfly’ solar cycle last?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "3.5 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "75 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "11 years"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these is NOT affected by sunspots?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tidal patterns"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Solar flares and geomagnetic storms"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Climate"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But their stories pale next to the most\nsuccessful pirate of all time. Madame Zheng commanded 1800 vessels, made enemies of several empires, and still lived to old age. Madame Zheng began her life as a commoner working on one of the many \nfloating brothels, or flower boats, in the port city of Guangzhou. By 1801, she had attracted \nthe attention of a local pirate captain named Zheng Yi,\nand the two soon married. Guangzhou’s fishermen had long engaged \nin small-scale piracy to supplement their meager incomes\nin the offseason. But a successful peasant uprising in \nneighboring Vietnam at the end of the 18th century\nhad raised the stakes. The victorious Tây Sơn rebels \nhad unified their country only to face a Chinese invasion and ongoing maritime battles with the \nVietnamese rulers they had overthrown. So they commissioned Guangzhou’s pirates \nto raid the coast and join the fight against their enemies. Serving their Vietnamese patrons \nturned the Zhengs and other pirates from ragtag gangs aboard single vessels into professional privateer fleets with dozens of ships \nable to hold their own at sea. In 1802, the Tây Sơn were overthrown and the pirates lost \ntheir safe harbor in Vietnam. But instead of scattering, the Zhengs met the crisis by uniting \nthe rival Cantonese pirate groups into a formidable alliance. At its height, the confederation \nincluded 70,000 sailors with 800 large junks and nearly 1,000 smaller vessels. Those were organized into six fleets \nmarked by different colored flags. The Zhengs were unlike many other \nhistorically-known privateers, such as Henry Morgan or Barbarossa, who acted on behalf \nof various naval powers. Instead, the Zhengs were now true outlaws, operating without support or approval \nfrom any government. Zheng Yi met an untimely end in 1807, but his widow didn’t hesitate \nto secure their gains. Through skillful diplomacy, Madame Zheng took \ncharge of the confederation, convincing the captains that their best\ninterests lay in continued collaboration. Meanwhile, she appointed Zhang Bao, \nthe young protege of her late husband, as the commander of her most \npowerful squadron, the Red Flag Fleet. Zhang became not only her right-hand man,\nbut her lover and, soon, her new husband. Madame Zheng consolidated her \npower through strict military discipline combined with a surprisingly \nprogressive code of laws. Female captives were theoretically \nprotected from sexual assault, and while pirates could \ntake them as wives, mistreatment or infidelity towards \nthem was punishable by death. Under Madame Zheng’s leadership, the pirates greatly \nincreased their power, with 200 cannons \nand 1300 guns in the Red Flag Fleet alone. Within a few years, they destroyed 63 of \nGuangdong Province’s 135 military vessels, forcing their commanders \nto hire more than 30 private junks. Madame Zheng was so feared that Chinese \ncommanders charged with apprehending her spent most of their time ashore, sometimes sabotaging their own \nvessels to avoid battle at sea. With little to stop them, the pirates were able to mount successful\n—and often brutal— raids on garrisons, villages, \nand markets throughout the coast. Using her administrative talents, Madame Zheng established financial offices\nin cities and villages, allowing her pirates to extract regular \nprotection payments on land and sea alike. This effectively created \na state within a state whose influence reached \nfar beyond the South China Sea. At the peak of her power, Madame Zheng’s confederation drove \nfive American schooners to safe harbor near Macao, captured a Portuguese brig, and blockaded a tribute \nmission from Thailand —all in a single day. But perhaps Madame Zheng’s greatest \nsuccess lay in knowing when to quit. By 1810, increasing tension\nbetween the Red and Black Flag Fleets weakened the confederation from within and rendered it more vulnerable \nto attack from without. So, when the Chinese government, \ndesperate to stop the raids, offered amnesty in exchange \nfor the pirates’ surrender, Madame Zheng and Zhang Bao agreed,\nbut only on their own terms. Their confederation was successfully \nand peacefully dismantled in April 1810, while Zhang Bao was allowed to retain \n120 junks for personal use and became an officer in the Chinese navy. Now fighting pirates himself, Zhang Bao quickly rose through \nthe ranks of military command, and Madame Zheng enjoyed all \nthe privileges of her husband’s status. After Zhang Bao died in 1822, Madame Zheng returned with their \neleven-year-old son to Guangzhou, where she opened a gambling house \nand quietly lived off the proceeds. She died at the age of 69—an uncommonly\npeaceful end to a pirate’s life."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The _____ Flag Fleet was the pirates’ most powerful one.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Red"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Black"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Green"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Blue"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What event raised the stakes of piracy in China by enabling petty pirates to become professional pirates?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Taiping Rebellion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Revolution of 1911"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Tây Sơn Rebellion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Tiananmen Incident"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What enabled the pirates to survive the loss of their safe haven in 1802?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The murder of their leader"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The creation of an alliance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The acquisition of more ships"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The addition of more men"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The _____ Flag Fleet was the pirates’ most powerful one.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Red"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Black"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Green"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Blue"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When did Madame Zheng become the leader of the confederation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "After murdering a powerful government official"}, {"label": "B", "text": "After setting up a protection racket"}, {"label": "C", "text": "After securing their gains following the death of her husband"}, {"label": "D", "text": "After sailing around the world on her ship"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Chinese commanders charged with exterminating Madame Zheng’s confederation _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Looked forward to military confrontations with them"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Created an alliance with the pirates"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Successfully exterminated them from the sea"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sabotaged their own vessels to avoid having to enter into battle with them"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Its verses praised \nthe burgeoning revolution, invoking the goddess of their new nation\nto aid the general’s righteous cause. But this ode to liberty wasn’t written\nby some aloof, aristocratic admirer. Its author was a young Black woman\nwho’d been enslaved for over a decade. The young girl, who’d been renamed\nPhillis Wheatley, had arrived in the colonies\non a slave ship in 1761. The ship landed in Boston, where Susanna and John Wheatley purchased\nPhillis to work in their house. However, for reasons that remain unclear,\nthey also taught her to read and write. Over the following decade, Wheatley became well versed \nin poetry and religious texts, eventually beginning to produce\nher own poems. The family published her work \nin a local newspaper, and in 1771, her elegy for renowned \nreverend George Whitefield captured the public’s imagination. The poem’s repetitive rhythms,\ndramatic religious references, and soaring spiritual language depicted how Whitefield’s sermons\n“inflame the soul and captivate the mind.” Wheatley ends with an arresting image\nof life after death, trusting that divine forces\n“will re-animate his dust.” This moving tribute found an audience\nin both the US and England. And since the piece was published \nwith a note identifying the author as an enslaved woman, many readers were as fascinated \nwith the poet as they were with the poem. In 1773, Phillis traveled to London, where her collection of “Poems \non Various Subjects, Religious and Moral” became the first book of poetry published\nby an African-American woman. It was filled with profound meditations\non life, death, and religion, as well as Biblical \nand classical references. In “A Hymn to Humanity,” Wheatley linked \nthese themes to her own creative growth, portraying herself as a muse \nsmiled upon by heavenly bodies. Unsurprisingly, Wheatley had her critics. Many white Americans believed \nBlack people were incapable of producing intellectual \nand creative work. Thomas Jefferson wrote that her writing\ndidn't even deserve to be called poetry, and others dismissed her as a poor\nimitation of another well-known poet. But many readers of the time were\nenamored with Wheatley's work, including prominent European\nwriters and politicians. Many modern readers, however, might expect her work to cover\na different topic: slavery. Wheatley rarely wrote directly about her\nexperiences as an enslaved person. And her poem addressing the topic \nhas been criticized for suggesting she was grateful \nthat enslavement led her to Christianity. But it’s incredibly unlikely Wheatley \nwould have been able to publicly condemn slavery without serious consequences. And many readers have found a more nuanced\ncritique hidden within her work. For example, Wheatley was a vocal\nsupporter of American independence, writing that her “love of freedom” \ncame from early experiences of being kidnapped into slavery \nand separated from her parents. When disparaging England’s \nimperial control, she evokes imagery of an “iron chain.” And by comparing her lack of freedom\nto America’s lack of independence, Wheatley subtly laments\nher own circumstances. Thankfully, Wheatley secured her freedom\nafter returning from London. The reasons for her emancipation\naren't entirely clear, as there’s no evidence of the Wheatleys\nfreeing other enslaved people. However, since Phillis could have\nremained free in London, some believe she bargained to make\nemancipation a condition of her return. It’s difficult to know exactly \nwhat happened, both here and throughout the rest \nof Wheatley’s life. Her proposal for a second book\nwas never published. In 1778, she married a free \nBlack man named John Peters. The two are believed to have had\nthree children, all of whom died in infancy. Their last child is thought to have died\naround the same time as Wheatley, and the two were buried together\nin an unmarked grave. While some of Wheatley’s letters survived,\nshe never released an account of her life. So despite her tenure as perhaps \nthe most famous African on the planet, Wheatley’s story has been lost \nto the ravages of history, like those of countless other \nenslaved peoples. But her poetry lives on today— celebrating creative growth\nand offering spiritual sustenance."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When did Phillis Wheatley arrive in Boston?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1753"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1761"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1773"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1775"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who was the subject of the poem that brought Phillis Wheatley her initial rise to international fame in 1771?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "George Washington"}, {"label": "B", "text": "John Wheatley"}, {"label": "C", "text": "George Whitefield"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Thomas Jefferson"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Where was Phillis Wheatley’s book, “Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral,” first published?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "London"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Boston"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Paris"}, {"label": "D", "text": "New York"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What year was Phillis Wheatley’s book published?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1753"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1761"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1773"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1775"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following subjects were often featured in Phillis Wheatley’s poetry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Christianity/Biblical stories"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Classical literature"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Politics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

She passed with flying colors. But as soon as she mastered \nthe rules of philosophy, she wanted to break them. She’d been schooled \non Plato’s Theory of Forms, which dismissed the physical world \nas a flawed reflection of higher truths and unchanging ideals. But for de Beauvoir, \nearthly life was enthralling, sensual, and anything but static. Her desire to explore the physical world \nto its fullest would shape her life, and eventually, \ninspire a radical new philosophy. Endlessly debating with her romantic \nand intellectual partner Jean Paul Sartre, de Beauvoir explored free will, desire, \nrights and responsibilities, and the value of personal experience. In the years following WWII, these ideas would converge \ninto the school of thought most closely associated with their work: \nexistentialism. Where Judeo-Christian traditions \ntaught that humans are born with preordained purpose, de Beauvoir and Sartre proposed \na revolutionary alternative. They argued that humans are born free, and thrown into existence \nwithout a divine plan. As de Beauvoir acknowledged, this freedom \nis both a blessing and a burden. In \"The Ethics of Ambiguity\" she argued \nthat our greatest ethical imperative is to create our own life’s meaning, while protecting the freedom \nof others to do the same. As de Beauvoir wrote, “A freedom which is interested only \nin denying freedom must be denied.” This philosophy challenged its students \nto navigate the ambiguities and conflicts our desires produce, \nboth internally and externally. And as de Beauvoir sought to find \nher own purpose, she began to question: if everyone deserves \nto freely pursue meaning, why was she restricted by society’s ideals\nof womanhood? Despite her prolific writing, \nteaching and activism, de Beauvoir struggled \nto be taken seriously by her male peers. She’d rejected her Catholic upbringing \nand marital expectations to study at university, and write memoirs,\nfiction and philosophy. But the risks she was taking \nby embracing this lifestyle were lost on many \nof her male counterparts, who took these freedoms for granted. They had no intellectual interest \nin de Beauvoir’s work, which explored women’s inner lives, as well the author’s open relationship \nand bisexuality. To convey the importance \nof her perspective, de Beauvoir embarked \non her most challenging book yet. Just as she’d created the foundations \nof existentialism, she’d now redefine the limits of gender. Published in 1949, \"The Second Sex\" \nargues that, like our life’s meaning, gender is not predestined. As de Beauvoir famously wrote, “one is not born, but rather becomes, \nwoman.” And to “become” a woman, she argued, \nwas to become the Other. De Beauvoir defined Othering \nas the process of labeling women as less than the men who’d \nhistorically defined, and been defined as, the ideal human subjects. As the Other, she argued that women \nwere considered second to men, and therefore systematically restricted \nfrom pursuing freedom. \"The Second Sex\" became \nan essential feminist treatise, offering a detailed history \nof women’s oppression and a wealth of anecdotal testimony. \"The Second Sex\"’s combination \nof personal experience and philosophical intervention provided a new language \nto discuss feminist theory. Today, those conversations are still \ninformed by de Beauvoir’s insistence that in the pursuit of equality, “there is no divorce between \nphilosophy and life.” Of course, like any foundational work, the ideas in \"The Second Sex\" have been \nexpanded upon since its publication. Many modern thinkers have explored \nadditional ways people are Othered that de Beauvoir doesn’t acknowledge. These include racial \nand economic identities, as well as the broader spectrum of gender \nand sexual identities we understand today. De Beauvoir’s legacy \nis further complicated by accusations of sexual misconduct \nby two of her university students. In the face of these accusations, she had her teaching license revoked \nfor abusing her position. In this aspect and others, \nde Beauvoir’s life remains controversial— and her work represents a contentious \nmoment in the emergence of early feminism. She participated in those conversations \nfor the rest of her life; writing fiction, philosophy, \nand memoirs until her death in 1986. Today, her work offers \na philosophical language to be reimagined, revisited \nand rebelled against— a response this revolutionary thinker \nmight have welcomed."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Simone De Beauvoir wanted to use philosophy to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Explore abstract concepts"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Explore the meaning of everyday life"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Support Plato’s theory of forms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Explore religion"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Simone De Beauvoir and Jean Paul Paul Sartre developed a school of philosophy called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stoicism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cynicism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Existentialism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Structuralism"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In The Ethics of Ambiguity, De Beauvoir argued that", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "We are born with preordained purpose"}, {"label": "B", "text": "We are born to serve God"}, {"label": "C", "text": "We are born free and must choose our own meaning"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In The Second Sex, De Beauvoir argued that", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gender roles are naturally occurring"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gender is socially constructed, and is the most oppressed social position"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gender is socially and culturally constructed, and is one of many ways in which people are oppressed"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "To make her arguments in The Second Sex, De Beauvoir", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Drew on women’s lived experience"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Wrote about the history of women’s oppression"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Created a theory of how gender works in everyday life"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Höll and Lemp were both victims of the \nwitch hunts that occurred in Europe and the American \ncolonies from the late 15th century \nuntil the early 18th century. These witch hunts were not a unified \ninitiative by a single authority, but rather a phenomenon that occurred \nsporadically and followed a similar pattern each time. The term “witch” has taken \non many meanings, but in these hunts, a witch was someone \nwho allegedly gained magical powers by obeying Satan rather than God. This definition of witchcraft spread \nthrough churches in Western Europe starting at the end of the 15th century. It really gained traction after the pope \ngave a friar and professor of theology named Heinrich Kraemer permission to conduct inquisitions in \nsearch of witches in 1485. His first, in the town of Innsbruck, didn’t gain much traction with the local\nauthorities, who disapproved of his harsh questioning\nof respectable citizens and shut down his trials. Undeterred, he wrote a book called the \n\"Malleus Maleficarum,\" or \"Hammer of Witches.\" The text argued for the existence of \nwitches and suggested ruthless tactics for hunting\nand prosecuting them. He singled out women as easier targets for\nthe devil’s influence, though men could also be witches. Kraemer’s book spurred others to write \ntheir own books and give sermons on the \ndangers of witchcraft. According to these texts, witches practiced rituals including \nkissing the Devil’s anus and poisoning or bewitching targets the \ndevil singled out for harm. Though there was no evidence to support\nany of these claims, belief in witches became widespread. A witch hunt often began \nwith a misfortune: a failed harvest, a sick cow, \nor a stillborn child. Community members blamed witchcraft, \nand accused each other of being witches. Many of the accused were people on \nthe fringes of society: the elderly, the poor, or social outcasts, but any member of the community\ncould be targeted, even occasionally children. While religious authorities encouraged \nwitch hunts, local secular governments usually carried \nout the detainment and punishment of accused witches. Those suspected of witchcraft were \nquestioned and often tortured— and under torture, thousands of innocent \npeople confessed to witchcraft and implicated others in turn. Because these witch hunts occurred \nsporadically over centuries and continents the specifics varied considerably. Punishments for convicted witches ranged \nfrom small fines to burning at the stake. The hunt in which Höll and Lemp were \naccused dragged on for nine years, while others lasted just months. They could have anywhere from a few to a \nfew hundred victims. The motivations of the witch hunters \nprobably varied as well, but it seems likely that many weren’t \nconsciously looking for scapegoats— instead, they sincerely believed \nin witchcraft, and thought they were doing good by \nrooting it out in their communities. Institutions of power enabled real harm to\nbe done on the basis of these beliefs. But there were dissenters all along– jurists, scholars, and physicians \ncountered books like Kraemer’s \"Hammer of Witches\" with texts objecting to the \ncruelty of the hunts, the use of forced confessions, \nand the lack of evidence of witchcraft. From the late 17th through the mid-18th \ncentury, their arguments gained force with the rise\nof stronger central governments and legal norms like due process. Witch hunting slowly declined until it \ndisappeared altogether. Both the onset and demise of these \natrocities came gradually, out of seemingly ordinary circumstances. The potential for similar situations, in which authorities use their powers to\nmobilize society against a false threat, still exists today— but so does the capacity of reasoned \ndissent to combat those false beliefs."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Witch Hunts in Europe finally declined because of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "stronger and more authoritative governments"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ideas and books contradicting the belief in witches"}, {"label": "C", "text": "objections to forced confessions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "improved legal protections for the accused"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The Witch Hunts took place roughly between the", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "end of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance"}, {"label": "B", "text": "12th century and the early 15th century"}, {"label": "C", "text": "late 1400s and early 1700s"}, {"label": "D", "text": "mid-1700s and the 1950s"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Most of the “witches” targeted in the Witch Hunts were defined as people", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "for whom connections to nature provided supernatural skills"}, {"label": "B", "text": "who tapped into their inner power to cast spells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "who learned magic by studying books about sorcery"}, {"label": "D", "text": "to whom Satan had given magical powers"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The title of Henry Kraemer’s book, Malleus Maleficarum, translates as", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A Discovery of Witches"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Hammer of Witches"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Malice of Magic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Malicious Women"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Many witches were identified, accused, and convicted because of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the use of harsh questioning and torture"}, {"label": "B", "text": "careful investigation and collection of evidence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "informants who had actually witnessed witchcraft"}, {"label": "D", "text": "victims who realistically named witches as the cause of their suffering3"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But the attack was not physical. This royal had been dead for 20 years. The attack was historical, an act of damnatio memoriae,\nthe damnation of memory. Somebody smashed the pharaoh's statues, took a chisel and attempted to erase \nthe pharaoh's name and image from history. Who was this pharaoh,\nand what was behind the attack? Here's the key: the pharaoh Hatshepsut was a woman. In the normal course of things,\nshe should never have been pharaoh. Although it was legal \nfor a woman to be a monarch, it disturbed some essential Egyptian beliefs. Firstly, the pharaoh was known\nas the living embodiment of the male god Horus. Secondly, disturbance to the tradition\nof rule by men was a serious challenge to Maat, a word for \"truth,\" \nexpressing a belief in order and justice, vital to the Egyptians. Hatshepsut had perhaps tried to adapt to this belief in the link between \norder and patriarchy through her titles. She took the name Maatkare, and sometimes referred to herself as Hatshepsu, \nwith a masculine word ending. But apparently, these efforts \ndidn't convince everyone, and perhaps someone \nerased Hatshepsut's image so that the world would forget \nthe disturbance to Maat, and Egypt could be balanced again. Hatshepsut, moreover, \nwas not the legitimate heir to the thrown, but a regent, \na kind of stand-in co-monarch. The Egyptian kingship traditionally \npassed from father to son. It passed from Thutmose I \nto his son Thutmose II, Hatshepsut's husband. It should have passed from Thutmose II \ndirectly to his son Thutmose III, but Thutmose III was a little boy \nwhen his father died. Hatshepsut, the dead pharaoh's chief wife and widow, stepped in to help \nas her stepson's regent but ended up ruling beside him \nas a fully fledged pharaoh. Perhaps Thutmose III was angry about this. Perhaps he was the one \nwho erased her images. It's also possible that someone wanted \nto dishonor Hatshepsut because she was a bad pharaoh. But the evidence suggests \nshe was actually pretty good. She competently fulfilled \nthe traditional roles of the office. She was a great builder. Her mortuary temple, Djeser-Djeseru, was an architectural phenomenon \nat the time and is still admired today. She enhanced the economy of Egypt, conducting a very successful trade mission\nto the distant land of Punt. She had strong religious connections. She even claimed to be the daughter \nof the state god, Amun. And she had a successful military career,\nwith a Nubian campaign, and claims she fought alongside \nher soldiers in battle. Of course, we have to be careful\nwhen we assess the success of Hatshepsut's career, since most of the evidence \nwas written by Hatshepsut herself. She tells her own story \nin pictures and writing on the walls of her mortuary temple and the red chapel she built for Amun. So who committed the crimes \nagainst Hatshepsut's memory? The most popular suspect is \nher stepson, nephew and co-ruler, Thutmose III. Did he do it out of anger \nbecause she stole his throne? This is unlikely since \nthe damage wasn't done until 20 years after Hatshepsut died. That's a long time to hang onto anger \nand then act in a rage. Maybe Thutmose III did it \nto make his own reign look stronger. But it is most likely that \nhe or someone else erased the images so that people would forget \nthat a woman ever sat on Egypt's throne. This gender anomaly was simply \ntoo much of a threat to Maat and had to be obliterated from history. Happily, the ancient censors \nwere not quite thorough enough. Enough evidence survived for us \nto piece together what happened, so the story of this unique powerful woman\ncan now be told."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is maat?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Egyptian food"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Truth and justice"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An Egyptian pharaoh"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Have a male pharaoh"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why was it unusual that Hatshepsut became pharaoh?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "She was a woman"}, {"label": "B", "text": "She was not the heir to the throne"}, {"label": "C", "text": "There was already a pharaoh on the throne"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following was NOT a traditional pharaonic role fulfilled by Hatshepsut?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Builder"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mother"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Religious leader"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Economic success"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the name of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Djeser-Djeseru"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Deir el Medina"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Karnak"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Amun"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Who was Hatshepsut's father?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Neferure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Thutmose I"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thutmose II"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Thutmose III"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 79, "lesson": 8, "title": "How Southern socialites rewrote Civil War history", "category": "The Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/ig6W6vJ5", "transcript": {"en": "Listen to how this textbook describes slavery. “The master often had a barbecue or a picnic\nfor his slaves. Then they had a great frolic. Even while working in the cotton fields they\nsang songs. The beat of the music and the richness of\ntheir voices made work seem light.” Yikes. That’s from History of Georgia, a textbook\npublished in 1954 that was taught across junior high schools in Georgia for decades. That sort of language is part of an intellectual\nmovement called the “Lost Cause” — a distorted version of American Civil War history\nthat’s been prevalent in the South for a long time. It took shape soon after the defeat of the\nConfederate States in the war, when Southern historians like Edward Pollard and former\nConfederate Gen. Jubal Early started preserving the South’s perspective through their writings. They framed the Confederate cause as a heroic\ndefense of the Southern way of life against the overwhelming forces in the North. That narrative has a few basic tenets: the\nglorification of Confederate soldiers who died for a cause they believed in, the belief\nthat slavery was a benevolent institution, and, maybe most importantly, that slavery\nwas not the root cause of the war. The Lost Cause is one of the most notoriously\neffective efforts to rewrite history, and it was done by the losing side. So how did it become so deeply rooted in Southern\nmemory? Blame the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The UDC was founded in Nashville in 1894 to\npreserve Confederate culture for generations to come. The women who made up the group descended\nfrom elite antebellum families and they used their social and political clout to spread\nthe pro-Southern version of the war as “real history.” You’ve probably seen their efforts to honor\nthe Confederacy, but maybe you didn’t know it was the UDC. They’re the ones who covered the Southern\nlandscape with memorials for Confederate leaders and soldiers. They used their fundraising and lobbying skills\nto pressure local governments into erecting monuments in prominent public spaces like\ncourthouses and state capitols. Installed here next to the state Capitol by\nthe United Daughters of the Confederacy. The United Daughters of the Confederacy donated\nthis memorial to the city back in the ’30s. They put them along roadsides and in parks. Any place that was remotely relevant to the\nConfederacy was memorialized. By the early 20th century, the UDC had 100,000\nmembers in chapters spread all over the country, but mostly in former Confederate states. And there’s a reason they grew so quickly\nduring that time. So we’re talking about roughly three decades\nafter the end of the war, and the Confederate veterans themselves are beginning to die off. So there is this push to find ways to commemorate\nit. Because the big challenge by 1900 was there’s\na new generation of white Southerners being born and they never experienced the war years. That push is visible. Most of the Confederate monuments were erected\nduring the UDC’s height of influence. There’s a rhetoric around monuments — that\nwe want to get this thing built before all of that generation has died off. And Dr. Karen Cox wrote the book on the UDC, and\nI asked her if it was fair to say the group established the Lost Cause as historical fact\nin the South. Oh, my God, yeah! They were the leaders of the Lost Cause into\nthe 20th century, and they made it a movement about vindication. Just to give you an idea of how effective\nthey were: They successfully lobbied for a Confederate Memorial in Arlington National\nCemetery, which US President Woodrow Wilson proudly unveiled to a cheering crowd. Now that’s influence, right? Monuments are the least of what they did. I mean they are the most visible and tangible,\nbut the work with children was far more influential. It turns out, a central UDC objective is shaping\nhow children think about the war and their Southern heritage. One of their most powerful tools? Textbooks. Take a look at this pamphlet, called “A\nMeasuring Rod for Text-Books.” It was written by “the illustrious Southern\nHistorian Miss Mildred Rutherford” an educator, orator, and an author of Southern history\ntextbooks. She was also very pro-slavery. The pamphlet announced the formation of a\ntextbook review committee featuring prominent Southerners, like five former Confederate\ngenerals. This group was committed to spreading the\n“truths of Confederate history” so they instructed school boards to reject any textbooks\nthat did not “accord full justice to the South.” And they urged libraries to deface every book\nin their collection that didn’t measure up by writing the words “Unjust to the South”\nclearly on its cover. This pamphlet was shared widely with school\nboards throughout the South, and UDC-backed committees closely monitored history books\nto make sure “Northern influence” never reached classrooms. So the core language of an approved textbook\naligned precisely with that of the Lost Cause. You know, stuff like “The Confederacy lost\nin the War between the States. But Georgia never forgot to honor her Confederate\nsoldiers…” History of Georgia was on the UDC’s approved\nlist. It was also written by E. Merton Coulter,\na self-described “Southern historian” and historian-described white supremacist. They understand that how you educate — who\nwins the writing game, who wins the battle over history — ultimately wins the war. That’s the big fight for the UDC. But their work with children went further\nthan the classrooms. The UDC formed an auxiliary group called the\nChildren of the Confederacy, which was designed to get kids born in former Confederate states\nto actively participate in their version of history. Group leaders had kids recite call-and-response\n“truths” from something called the “Confederate Catechism.” Children, up to the age of 18, would compete\nand be rewarded for memorizing long passages of Lost Cause rhetoric. So it would be like an after-school thing,\nyou know, like that was your club. You would go after school to the meeting of\nthe Children of the Confederacy and your leader might teach you songs of the South like “Dixie”\nor other songs that were considered Southern patriotic songs. They would have them write essays, go visit\nthe veterans, and learn this catechism. Children were also the centerpiece of their\ncommunity’s monument unveilings, like this “living flag” at the dedication of the\nStonewall Jackson monument in Richmond. Yes, those are schoolchildren. The UDC's efforts shaped the identities of\nchildren who grew up with the Lost Cause. They made history personal, and that made\ntheir story last longer. Generations of generations of children learning\nthat narrative in a variety of ways grow up to be, you know, segregationists in the ’50s\nand ’60s. Because that’s been drilled into them since\nthey were children. After World War I, the UDC started losing\nsteam. But the damage was done. The monuments were in place and the textbooks\nthey wrote remained in Southern classrooms until the late ’70s. And the women’s group did it all without\nthe right to vote or participate in politics. You can still get glimmers of this Lost Cause\nmemory of the war And I think the UDC, to a great extent was\n— that was their goal. So the next time someone says the Confederate\nmonuments are about just know that that’s exactly what the United\nDaughters of the Confederacy wants you to think."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When was the United Daughters of the Confederacy founded?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1914"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1776"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1865"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1894"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

I'm going to say that every single\none of us in this room made drawings when we were little. Yes? Yes? OK. And maybe around the age of like,\nfour or five or something like that, you might have been drawing, and a grown-up came over\nand looked over your shoulder and said, \"What's that?\" And you said, \"It's a face.\" And they said, \"That's not really what a face looks like. This is what a face looks like.\" And they proceeded to draw this. Circle, two almonds for some eyes, this upside-down seven\nsituation we have here, and then a curved line. But guess what? This doesn't really look\nthat much like a face, OK? It's an icon. It's visual shorthand, and it's how we look\nat so much of our world today. See, we have so much information\ncoming at us all the time, that our brains literally\ncan't process it, and we fill in the world with patterns. Much of what we see\nis our own expectations. All right. I'm going to show you a little trick to rewire your brain into looking again. Did you all get an envelope\nthat says \"do not open\" on it? Grab that envelope, it's time to open it. Inside should be\na piece of paper and a pencil. Once you have that all prepped, please turn to somebody next to you. Ideally, somebody you don't know. Yeah, we're doing this, people, we're doing this. (Laughs) Great. Everybody find a partner? OK, now look back at me. OK, now look back at me. You are going to draw each other, OK? No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait. I promise this is not\nabout doing a good drawing, OK? That's not what we're doing here, we're looking, this is about looking. Everybody's going to be terrible,\nI promise, don't worry. You're going to draw each other\nwith two very simple rules. One, you are never going to lift\nyour pencil up off the paper. One continuous line. No, no, trust me here. This is about looking, OK? So one continuous line\nnever lift the pencil. Number two, never, ever, ever look down\nat the paper you're drawing on, OK? Yes, it's about looking. So keep looking at the person\nyou're drawing. Now put your pencil down in\nthe middle of the paper, OK? Look up at your partner. Look at the inside of one of their eyes. Doesn't matter which one. That's where you're going to start. Ready? Deep breath. (Inhales) And begin. Now, just draw but notice where you are, you're starting there\nand you see there is a corner, maybe there's a curve there. Notice those little lines, the eyelashes. People are wearing masks,\nsome aren't, just work with that. Now just go slow. Pay attention and draw what you see. And don't look down. Just keep going. (Murmuring) And just five more seconds. And stop. Look down at your beautiful drawings. (Laughter) Right? Show your partner\ntheir incredible portrait. It's so good, right? I want to see them. Hold them up. Can you guys hold them up? Hold up, everybody. Oh my gosh. Are you kidding me? You all are amazing. OK, you can put your drawings back down, tuck them under, put them on the paper. That was wonderful. I mean, they're all terrible,\nbut they're wonderful. Why are they wonderful? Because you all just drew a face. You drew what you saw. You didn't draw what you think\na face looks like, right? You also just did something\nthat people rarely do. You just made intimate eye-to-eye, face-to-face contact with someone\nwithout shying away for almost a minute. Through drawing, you slowed down, you paid attention, you looked closely at someone and you let them look closely at you. Good job. I have found that drawing like this creates an immediate connection\nlike nothing else. Alright. So I call myself an illustrator\nand a graphic journalist. I draw, I tell stories. I spend time with people\nlooking and listening. And I take the words\nof the people that I speak with and I put it together with drawings\nthat I do, mostly from life, just like you all just did. I found that drawing like this\ndoes a lot of things that photography can't do. So when somebody points\na camera at you, how do you feel? A little objectified, right? When I'm drawing,\nI hold my sketchbook low and it keeps an open channel\nbetween me and the person I'm drawing. A lot of time somebody will see me drawing\nand they'll get curious. They'll come over to me, and a real, authentic conversation begins. Let me give you an example. So a while back, I wanted to do a drawn story about how the public library\nserves our elders. But after spending a few days\nkind of lurking around with a sketch pad, looking over older folks' shoulders\nand asking them what they were reading, I wasn't really getting the story. Until I stumbled upon Leah. Leah is the first, and at the time\nwas the only, full-time social worker dedicated to a library in the nation. Turns out, public library\ndefinitely serves our elders. It is also a social service\nepicenter of a city. This is Charles. Charles works with Leah. And he does outreach\nwithin the library to folks who are experiencing homelessness. And he took me around, I carried my sketch pad\nand I was drawing everything I saw, and he showed me a very different library\nthan I'd previously seen. So computers that I assumed\nwere for checking-out books, or, you know, looking at emails, were in fact a lifeline for folks\nwho are searching for jobs and housing. The sinks in the public restroom, they are a laundromat and showers\nfor folks who are sleeping on the street. A library is a safe, quiet place where anybody can go and find resources and rest for free. See, the moment I stopped looking\nfor the story that I expected to see, an entirely new\nand richer truth was revealed. I found this to be true with everything\nand everyone I've ever drawn. OK, so I draw from life,\nright, like you guys did. And so I built myself a mobile studio in the back of a swanky Honda Element -- So that I could go anywhere, talk to anyone at any time and then draw\nand paint and sleep in the back. It is very cozy. I was on the road in Utah, drawing and talking to people, when I spotted on the side of the road\na hand-painted wooden sign. It said \"Bootmaker.\" I stopped. A tall, white, handlebar mustached man\nwearing a cowboy shirt, opened the door and found me, a sketchbook-carrying, jumpsuit-wearing,\nurban, lefty lesbian, smiling like, waving like a dork. (Laughter) When I spotted the stuffed cougar\non the wall behind him, this vegetarian thought she knew\nall she needed to know about Don the bootmaker. But there we were. So I asked him if he'd just show me\nquickly a little bit about his craft. He agreed. And we ended up spending\nthe whole day together, as I drew out Don in his workshop, and he told me about the sudden death\nof his beloved wife, about his deep, deep grief, and about this hunting trip\nthat he was planning, and so looking forward\nto taking with his son. Every tool in that shop held a story. And he was so, so happy to share it with somebody\nwho was genuinely curious and interested. By the end of the day, Don and I looked\nvery different to one another. And this drawing, which ended up in my visual column\nin the New York Times or as Don likes to call it,\nthe fake-news media -- (Laughter) now hangs framed on the wall\nof his big game trophy room. (Laughter) (Applause) So I was getting ready to start\non a new drawn story when the pandemic hit. And overnight I was, like so many people,\njust unable to do my job. It was my own mother who suggested\nthat I teach drawing to kids. Kids who were about to lose\ntheir routines, be stuck at home, and to help give parents\na much needed short break. Now I'm trained as a social worker, but I'd never taught kids before. But the night before school\nclosures in San Francisco, I went on Instagram and announced that the next day\nwe'd try something called DrawTogether. 10 am. I sat behind my drawing table\nin my home studio and my wonderful wife\npointed an iPhone at me and pressed \"Go live.\" And what I thought would be 100 kids, ended up being 12,000. All eager to draw a dog. The next day, 14,000 kids came and we drew a tree, and that drawing exercise\nthat you all just did. What was supposed to be\nfive minutes for five days, ended up being 30 minutes a day, five days a week, for months. And yeah, we talked about line and shape and we learned about perspective and light and shadow. But what was really going on was we were actively looking our way\nthrough a global catastrophe together. See, drawing slows us down. It keeps our hands moving so we can pay attention to things that we usually overlook\nor that we ignore. Studies show that drawing\nis one of the most effective ways for kids to process their emotions, and that includes trauma. It helps us talk about hard things. We say something in DrawTogether,\nit sounds hokey, but it is true. Drawing is looking and looking is loving. If we can give kids the right\nsupportive environment, drawing helps them let go\nof perfectionism and fear of failure so that they, unlike you and me, and especially those of us\nwho might have freaked out just a wee bit when I said earlier\nwe were going to draw, right? We can let go of these\nharder self-judgments so we don't have to undo\nthem later in life. OK, I don't expect you all\nto become drawers. But I do know that all of us,\nkids, grownups, everyone in this room, we can all be better at looking. Because this is not a face. And when we live like this drawing, we miss out on all of the depth\nand detail of the world and people around us. This is a face. And this is a face. And that is such a face. (Laughs) And these are faces. And if you slow down, I promise, pay attention and really look. You will fall back in love\nwith the world and everyone in it. And after the past few years we've had, I think we all desperately need a chance\nto look closely at one another and at ourselves, and tell the real truth about what we see. Thank you.

Stretching over roughly\nnine million square kilometers, this massive desert receives about \n22 million terawatt hours of energy from the Sun every year. That’s well over 100 times more energy \nthan humanity consumes annually. So, could covering the desert with solar \npanels solve our energy problems for good? Solar panels work when light particles hit\ntheir surface with enough energy to knock electrons \nout of their stable bonds. On their journey back to stability, \nthese electrons produce electricity. However, there’s a limit to how much power\npanels can generate. Solar panels can only interact \nwith certain wavelengths of light, making it impossible to convert \nover half the sunlight they receive. And even light particles they can convert\noften bounce off them without ever hitting an electron. But thanks to clever scientists \nand engineers and substantial government investment, solar panels are generating \nmore electricity than ever. Anti-reflective coatings and patterns \non the panels’ surface create more opportunities for incoming \nlight particles to hit electrons. These techniques have increased commercial\nsolar panel efficiency from the low-teens to 25%, with experimental models reaching\nup to 47%. What’s more, solar has gotten \n89% cheaper over the last decade, thanks in part to global supply chains\nfor other technologies that use the same materials. Together, these factors have \nmade solar power the cheapest source of electricity \non Earth. Countries including India, China, \nEgypt, and the US, have already taken\nthese new panels into the desert. Their massive solar farms range \nfrom 15 to 56 square kilometers, and when the sun is high in the sky, these plants can provide energy for hundreds of thousands\nof local residents. But these farms also get\nextremely hot. Light that solar cells don’t convert \nor reflect is absorbed as heat, which reduces a panel’s efficiency. And the cooling systems employed by many\nfarms can use huge amounts of energy powering fans or moving water \nto maintain optimal temperatures. Even with these systems, solar panels \nin the desert absorb far more heat than the natural sandy environment. This hasn’t been a problem\non the scale of existing solar farms. But if we tried to cover the Sahara, this effect could create massive changes\nin the region's climate. Constructing solar farms already\ndisrupts local ecosystems, but a plant of this scale could \ndramatically transform the desert landscape. Thankfully, solar panels\naren’t our only option. And some of the largest solar plants \nin the world are trying a new approach: giant mirrors. Morocco’s Noor Power Plant, which will eventually cover roughly \n30 square kilometers of the Sahara, is a concentrated solar power plant. This design reflects light \nonto a receiver, which converts that energy to heat,\nand then electricity. These mirrors still create a dangerous\ntemperature shift for local wildlife, but they have less potential\nto transform the landscape. And since it takes time for the materials\nbeing heated to cool off, these plants often continue producing\nelectricity past sunset. Whether they use panels or mirrors, industrial solar farms are often easy to\nfit into existing energy infrastructure. However, getting their electricity beyond\nlocal power grids is much more difficult. Some countries are working on ways to\nconnect electric grids across the globe. And many farm store energy\nin massive batteries, or convert their electricity \ninto clean gas that can be used later. But right now, these techniques are still\ntoo expensive and inefficient to rely on. Worse still, industrial renewables\ncan share some of the same problems as fossil fuels, relying on destructive mining operations \nand carbon-emitting global supply chains. Fortunately, solar can\nexist on many scales, from industrial solar farms \nto smaller installations that power individual buildings \nand rural communities. These projects can supplement energy use\nor provide a passive source of energy for regions off the grid. And since solar panels rely \non a few simple components, they’re quick to install \nand relatively easy to update. In fact, it’s this flexibility \nthat enabled solar to become so cheap and ubiquitous \nover the last decade. So if we want to keep up with humanity's\nrising energy use, we'll need answers both big and small."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why is there a limit to the amount of power that solar panels generate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Solar panels are an outdated technology."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Solar panels can only interact with certain wavelengths of light."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Solar panels can overload local power grids, so production is capped."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Solar panels typically aren’t exposed to enough light."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Solar power has gotten ___ cheaper over the last decade.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "23%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "99%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "48%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "89%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why don’t we cover the Sahara with solar panels?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It could dramatically transform the desert ecosystem."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It would be too difficult to keep sand out of the inner workings of the panels."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It would be too costly to taxpayers."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The technology is not advanced enough to accommodate the energy output."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How are concentrated solar plants able to generate power after the sun sets?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They incorporate a greater number of panels to process residual energy."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Large cooling systems are employed to increase panel efficiency."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It takes time for the materials to cool off, so they continue to generate power even without sunlight."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Panels in these plants are larger than usual, so they absorb more energy during daylight hours."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What are some countries doing to move solar energy beyond local power grids?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Working on ways to connect electric grids across the globe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Building solar farms in urban areas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Harvesting greater amounts of energy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Encouraging local populations to use less electricity"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

federal marshals we've been sent by the president of the united states and we are here to escort you to school today the governor of the state decided that i will not force my people to integrate against their will going through this kind of living hell what would you expect crowds of protesters lined to the streets teachers at the school refused to instruct her governor george wallace who blocked by literally standing in the door 200 people waiting at 8 30 in the morning to tell her they were going to kill her then they had a machine gun beside their guns they threatened to poison ruby president of the united states and troops you are one of my heroes i'm here because of you the governor called the national guard all because of just one little girl he pulled his gun to shoot things were gonna get really worse i can't believe this kind of stuff happens i would like to know what's happening to her until now she has never told the full story of what happened to her when they knocked on the door my parents opened the door and i remember standing there and seeing these four very tall white men i remember them saying that we're federal marshals we've been sent by the president of the united states and we are here to escort you and your daughter to school today i found myself in the car driving this very short drive to this new school and the minute we turned the corner i saw what i thought was mighty girl there were so many people standing out in the middle of the street and they were screaming and shouting and throwing things i draw the line in the dust and i say segregation now segregation tomorrow and segregation forever the car door opened and those federal marshals they grabbed my hand and i remember them saying ruby walk straight ahead and don't look back one of the city policemen he pulled his gun to shoot and everybody say they knew private to kill me and says if they killed the mother the child wouldn't have went 200 people waiting at 8 30 in the morning to tell her they were going to kill 200 people in the afternoon telling you they're going to kill her the crowd would come and they would bring a small baby's coffin and they put this black doll inside of the coffin and they would march around the school and i would have to pass it to get inside of the building and i used to have nightmares about the coffin this is a people's movement it doesn't make any difference whether the major politicians are going to support you or not if they don't support us in this movement to take back our government and give it to us and let us run our own institutions those who stand in the way are liable to get run over when i got inside of the building i remember it being very quiet i received a call from the superintendent's office and asking me if i would like to take a first grade position that morning when i arrived of course the anger and the hostility was palpable i was told that if i went downstairs i would meet my student so i walked down to a cavernous basement area of the school those doors instantly opened and amidst this towering presence of federal marshals stood the most beautiful little girl one could ever dream of seeing looking so delicate so unaware of the mantle for change she wore that day and as i went over toward her to introduce myself she came forward and i think she felt she was pretty special and she was and she looked that way she beautiful pink dress party dress and as i walked over to meet her her bowed head sort of raised gently and a little smile came across her face and then those beautiful big brown eyes that she still has rose to nepal and you know it was a case of love at first sight how could you not fall in love with a child like that in a moment like that and so leaving behind a cameo of the past ruby and i held our hands left them walked together upstairs to our first grade classroom and began our solitary adventure i remember looking at her and thinking she's white i've never seen a white teacher before she looked exactly like the people outside she wasn't by the next day the crowds had doubled they kept pointing at me and shouting kept saying we're gonna poison her we're gonna hang her i remember hearing my mom said that she would send me the school and that every day she would sit and pray all day to three o'clock until i walked back through the door and the federal marshals they met with my parents and they said you should prepare her lunch and she should eat it at her desk they actually thought that i was afraid of being poisoned and i remember them coming to me and saying why were you not eating and why did you lie and i said because i want to eat lunch in the cafeteria with the other kids the minute we got to the cafeteria and they pushed open the doors nothing but empty tables there were no kids and i remember being so disappointed about that i just knew they were in the cafeteria i would go into this coat closet to hang up my coat and every time i went into the closet i would hear kids voices and i would mention it to my teacher and she wouldn't say anything and there were days when i would go back into the closet and i would just stand there just to see if i really heard them and i did you see there were white parents who tried to send their kids to school with me those white parents had to cross the same picket line that i did and they were never protected by federal marshals as they crossed the picket line the principal would take the kids and she would hide them so they would never see me and i would never see them i went up to the principal and i said why are they not with ruby and she said well that teacher won't teach her and i said well i will teach them and so shortly thereafter they would come and join us for the afternoon and i do remember that beginning where those three or four little kids just gingerly walked into that room because that was the first time they had ever been in a classroom with a black child i went in to sit down to play with them but that is the day because a little boy looked at me and he said i can't play with you my mom said not to play with you because you're and the minute he said that i remember to this very day it felt as if this weight lifted off my shoulders all of a sudden by him saying that i knew why there were no kids there and the truth is even though he hurt my feelings i was never angry with him because in my mind i thought he was explaining to me why he couldn't play with me he said my mom said not to play with you and i thought to myself if my mom had said ruby don't play with him he's asian don't play with him he's indian he's hispanic he's white if my mom had said not to play with him i would not have played with him so i wasn't angry with him i understood one cannot underestimate the courage of ruby and the power a child has i believe it was in the best interest of white and black uh to be in a segregated school system but i was wrong our children need to know that white folks black folks they stood together thank god for the teacher that was there she was my best friend and she taught me the lesson that dr king tried to teach each and every one of us and that is we should never judge a person by the color of their skin [Applause] i always say that she showed me her heart we had a grand time together i think side by side than just the two of us i believe that if we are going to get past our racial differences it's going to come from our kids but we as adults have to allow them opportunities to come together i think it's

At ground level, the Amazon River\nand its tributaries weave their path. But above the canopy,\nbigger waterways are on the move. These flying rivers are almost invisible,\nbut are essential to life on Earth. As rain seeps into the soil, trees draw water\nback up through their roots and pump it through their trunks\nfor nourishment. The leaves and stems transpire,\nor release, excess water in the form of vapor. In the Amazon, a fully grown tree transpires between 200\nand 1,000 liters of water a day. This collective release creates\na startling phenomenon: huge jets of rapid, humid air\nthat constantly flow above the canopy. Dubbed “flying rivers”\nby a Brazilian climatologist, these aerial waterways carry\nabout 20 billion tons of water through the air per day. This is more than the Amazon River’s\ndaily output into the ocean. Along the equator,\nthe trade winds blow from east to west. Caught in these winds, flying rivers flow\nin the same direction before encountering the Andes. The mountains act like a giant barrier, causing the winds and rivers\nto redirect southwards. When flying rivers meet\nthe masses of cold air, they grow heavier and release\ntorrents of water. In this way, they bring rain,\ncooler temperatures, and humidity to much of South America. But these waterways are under threat. Clearing the Amazon\nfor agriculture and industry is already causing flying rivers \nto dry up, leading to drought and hotter temperatures\nacross South America. If this pattern continues, swaths of the continent may be reduced\nto desert in a matter of decades. In response, a radical movement is working\nintensely to keep the rainforest— and the flying rivers— alive. The northwest of the Peruvian Amazon\nis the territory of the Wampís Nation, a community of over 15,000 people who manage over 130,000 square kilometers\nof land. These Indigenous people have lived\nin the rainforest for thousands of years, practicing sustainable hunting,\nfishing, and agriculture. For the Wampís, protecting the rainforest has long meant\nfighting invaders. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, Wampís people resisted\nand expelled the Incas and later the Spanish colonists\nwho exploited the rainforest. Today, the Wampís Nation are still\nbattling extractive industries— and the policies that sanction them. For instance, since the 1960s, the Peruvian government has been\nlicensing the Wampís’ territory to corporations for gold mining\nand oil extraction. These activities poison the rivers,\nclear thousands of trees, and threaten the Wampís way of life. In 2015, after years of protests\nand negotiations, the community formed the\nAutonomous Territorial Government of the Wampís Nation. While the Wampís people remain\nPeruvian citizens, they seek recognition as a government responsible for their own lands, forests,\nand internal affairs. In its policies, the Wampís Nation\nprioritizes collective land ownership, cultural preservation,\nand conservation of animals, plants, and natural cycles\nthat protect the rainforest. This is the foundation of their\nphilosophy of Tarimat Pujut, or living in harmony with nature to ensure food, friendships,\nand quality of life. The high, humid forest\nof the Wampís Nation is crucial to the flying river cycle, transpiring over 34 million liters\nof water a day that flow to Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. To track this output, Wampís scientists\nmeasure rainfall, monitor the wind, and weigh water levels in leaves and soil. One of their climate goals is to defend\nthis and other natural systems, including native soil\nthat acts as a carbon sink and the forest itself as a fire barrier. The Wampís Nation constantly battles\ncorporations that threaten these systems. Between 2016 and 2018, the community fought illegal gold mining\nalong the Santiago River. They organized protests,\nuncovered mercury pollution, guarded the area,\nand attacked illegal machinery for months, eventually expelling the miners. And in 2017, the Wampís Nation\nsuccessfully petitioned a court to bar a private oil company\nfrom their land. While these are significant victories, the Wampís Nation and other Indigenous\ngroups need more recognition and support. Indigenous people and local communities\nlive in and manage more than a quarter of the world’s land, but only have legal ownership\nto a small percentage of it. And less than 1% of international climate\nand forest funds go to their crucial conservation efforts. This is despite the fact that forests\nmanaged by Indigenous people have better survival rates. The Amazon is often described with\nlanguage evocative of a giant organism— one that grows, dies, breathes\nin carbon dioxide and exhales oxygen. The processes that sustain it\nweave together in a complex and often invisible web of water, air,\nsoil, and human activity— both destructive and protective. We are far from understanding it\nin its entirety, but some are closer than others."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The process of trees releasing excess water from their leaves and stems is called ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Evaporation "}, {"label": "B", "text": "Transpiration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Vaporization "}, {"label": "D", "text": "Suction"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How much water per day do the Amazon’s flying rivers carry through the air?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "20,000 tons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "200,000 tons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20 million tons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20 billion tons"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The Wampís people have lived in the rainforest for thousands of years, but when was The Autonomous Territorial Government of the Wampís Nation formed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15th century "}, {"label": "B", "text": "17th century"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20th century"}, {"label": "D", "text": "21st century"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following are policies of the Wampís Nation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Collective land ownership"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cultural preservation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Environmental conservation "}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Across the world, Indigenous people and local communities only have legal ownership of an estimated 10% of their territories, despite managing more than a quarter of the world’s land.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 79, "lesson": 14, "title": "How to calm your anxiety, from a neuroscientist - Wendy Suzuki", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-calm-your-anxiety-from-a-neuroscientist-wendy-suzuki", "transcript": {"en": "You know when you get that ambiguous\nemail from your boss and you start to feel sweaty palms and that empty, freaked out\nsensation in your stomach? Welcome back, anxiety. Most of us think of anxiety\nas a bad thing, something to be avoided at all costs. But what if it weren't? What if you could take all of that energy\nracing around your brain and your body and transform it into something helpful? [The Way We Work] Global anxiety levels, both the clinical kind and what I call\nthe everyday kind, have increased tremendously\nin recent years. And many of us are noticing this at work. We might think of anxiety as something that we'd rather just leave\non the side of the road if we could. But anxiety is an important tool\nthat arose during our evolution that we use to avoid danger. It's essential for our survival. So how come we don't even feel\nvaguely protected by it? It's because the volume of our individual\nand collective anxiety levels has been turned way up too high, and too much of even a potentially\ngood thing like anxiety is bad. So I would like to share\ntwo powerful, science-based tools for turning down the volume on our anxiety and helping us get anxiety back\nto its helpful, protective state. And both of these tools begin\nby connecting with our bodies. Tool number one is breath work. It's just simple, deep breathing. Slowly inhale and exhale. This can be one of the most\nimmediate ways to calm anxiety, because deep breath directly activates the natural de-stressing part\nof our nervous systems called the parasympathetic nervous system. I recommend a boxed breathing approach, which is: inhale deeply on four counts, hold at the top for four counts, exhale deeply on four counts and hold at the bottom for four counts. You can even do this in the middle\nof any anxiety-provoking conversation, and no one will even know. Lots of people, from ancient monks to modern meditators, have figured this tool out\nand use it all the time. Tool number two: moving your body. This one also has immediate\npositive effects on your mood state, but for a different reason. Every time you move your body, you're releasing a whole bunch\nof beneficial neurochemicals in your brain. These neurochemicals include dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and endorphins, mood and reward-boosting neurochemicals that work to both increase\npositive mood states and decrease negative ones. I like to say that every single\ntime you move your body, it's like giving yourself a wonderful\nbubble bath of neurochemicals for your brain. So when your boss's email comes in\nand your heart starts to race, what exactly can you do? If you're in an office, try taking a short walk around the block or even to the supply closet\nfor some sticky notes. If you're working from home, put on two of your favorite songs and dance around the living room\nlike no one is watching. Studies have shown that all it takes\nis ten minutes of walking to get those mood-boosting effects. But be creative\nwith your movement session. Whether that's a quick session\nof power vacuuming a la Mrs. Doubtfire when you’re stressed about a deadline or doing a set of jumping jacks or getting off the elevator\none floor early to do a power walk\nup that last flight of stairs before an important meeting. All of these possibilities will all help\nyour anxiety levels come down. In fact, I tested this effect\non my own NYU students. First, I had them take\nan anxiety assessment before leading them in a movement session that included movements\nfrom kickbox and dance and yoga and martial arts together with positive\nspoken affirmations. Then I had them retake\nthat same anxiety assessment again. What happened? After our movement session, their anxiety scores\nhad decreased to normal levels. Now that's powerful, real-world example\nthat you can use in your life today. So make sure to incorporate\nthese bursts of activity in your day, and try one out next time\nyou're feeling stress. It can really make your anxiety\nfeel less all-consuming. Once you connect with your body and turn the volume down on your anxiety, two important things will happen. First, when that email comes in, you'll be in a better position to evaluate what about it makes you anxious. Is it that you've taken on too much or that you feel insecure\nabout a particular skill set? In other words, you'll be able to use\nthis emotion, anxiety, for exactly what it was evolved to do: warn you about potential dangers\nso you can become aware of them and find ways to effectively\nand creatively address them in your everyday life. Second, once you find the warning\nsignals in your anxiety, you'll be able to communicate with others. You might seek out advice\nfrom a trusted colleague when that difficult issue arises. Or you might even have\na conversation with your boss about how to prioritize projects. Because you're no longer\nin fight-or-flight mode, asking for that support\nwon't feel nearly as threatening. And one of the best gifts of approaching\nyour anxiety in this way is that you will be able to notice\nthose telltale signs of anxiety in everyone else around you, especially those forms of anxiety\nyou're most familiar with. And what will that do? That will allow you to give that person\na smile or a kind word to help them through that moment. In other words, your own form of anxiety can boost\nyour personal super power of empathy. And I can't think of anything\nwe need in this world today more than higher levels\nof empathy for one another. Your take-home in all of this? If you breathe, move and take note\nof what your anxiety is signaling, you'll feel more fulfilled, more creative, more connected and less stressed overall. And that's my wish for every one of us."}, "multiple-choice": []}

Reverby", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/ugly-history-the-u-s-syphilis-experiment-susan-m-reverby", "transcript": {"en": "In the 1930s, the United States\nwas ravaged by syphilis. This sexually transmitted infection\nafflicted nearly 1 in 10 Americans, producing painful sores and rashes \nthat persisted for roughly two years. After these initial symptoms, late-stage\nsyphilis was known to cause organ damage, heart and brain disorders,\nand even blindness. It was incredibly difficult \nto slow the disease’s spread. Experts cautioned against unprotected sex, but the infection could also be\npassed during childbirth. Worse still, existing treatments\nlike mercury and bismuth were considered unreliable at best\nand potentially harmful at worst. Today these heavy metals \nare classified as toxic, but at the time, doctors were still \nuncovering their dangerous side effects. Amidst the uncertainty, health care \nprofessionals had two key questions. Did late-stage syphilis warrant \nthe risks of existing treatments? And, did the infected individual’s race\nchange how the disease progressed? Many physicians were convinced\nsyphilis affected the neurological systems of white patients and the cardiovascular systems\nof Black patients. There was little evidence for this theory, but the U.S. Public Health Service \nwas determined to investigate further. In 1932 they launched a massive experiment\nin Tuskegee, Alabama. The town had already possessed\na small hospital, and the area was home to a large\npopulation of potential participants. The PHS collaborated \nwith local doctors and nurses to recruit roughly 400 Black men presumed \nto have noncontagious late-stage syphilis, as well as 200 non-syphilitic Black men \nfor their control group. But their recruitment plan\ncentered on a lie. While the researchers planned to observe \nhow syphilis would progress with minimal treatment, participants were told they would receive \nfree drugs and care for their condition. At first, researchers gave the men\nexisting treatments, but these were soon replaced\nwith placebos. Under the false pretense of providing\na special remedy, researchers performed painful and invasive\nspinal taps to investigate the disease’s \nneurological consequences. When patients died, the PHS\nwould swoop in to study the body by funding funerals in exchange\nfor autopsies. In their published studies, they listed \nthe men as volunteers to obscure the circumstances under which\nthey’d been recruited. Outside Alabama, syphilis treatment \nwas advancing. A decade after the study began, clinical trials confirmed that penicillin \neffectively cured the disease in its early stages. But in Tuskegee, researchers were\ndetermined to keep pursuing what they considered vital research. They had yet to confirm their theories\nabout racial difference, and they believed they would never have\nanother opportunity to observe the long-term effects \nof untreated syphilis. The study’s leadership decided to withhold\nknowledge of new treatments from their subjects. During World War II, researchers convinced\nthe local draft board to exempt men from their study, preventing them from enlisting \nand potentially accessing penicillin. The study even continued\nthrough the 1950s when penicillin was shown to help\nmanage late-stage syphilis. By today’s bioethical standards, withholding treatment in a research study \nwithout a patient’s informed consent is morally abhorrent. But for a large part of the 20th century,\nthis practice was not uncommon. In the 1940s, US led studies \nin Guatemala infected numerous prisoners, sex workers, soldiers,\nand mental health patients with sexually transmitted infections \nto study potential treatments. And other studies throughout \nthe 50s and 60s saw doctors secretly infecting patients\nwith viral hepatitis or even cancer cells. Eventually, researchers began objecting \nto these unjust experiments. In the late 1960s, an STI contact tracer \nnamed Peter Buxtun convinced the PHS to consider \nending the study. But after leadership decided against it, \nBuxtun sent his concerns to the press. In July of 1972, an exposé of the Tuskegee\nstudy made headlines across the country. Following public outcry,\na federal investigation, and a lawsuit, the study was finally shut down in 1972—\n40 years after it began and 30 after a treatment \nfor syphilis had been found. No evidence of any racial difference\nwas discovered. When the study ended, only 74 \nof the original 600 men were alive. 40 of their wives and 19 of their children\nhad contracted syphilis, presumably from their husbands\nand fathers. In the wake of this tragedy, \nand concerns about similar experiments, Congress passed new regulations \nfor ethical research and informed consent. But systemic racism continues to permeate\nmedical care and research throughout the US. To truly address these issues, the need for structural change, \nbetter access to care, and transparency in research \nremains urgent."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In the 1930s, the most common treatments for syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease, were:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Guaiacum, or holy wood"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Penicillin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Antibiotics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mercury and Bismuth"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The men in the study in Tuskegee were:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Told they were in an experiment and were being treated"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Told they were being treated by doctors for their “bad blood”"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Told they were making a great contribution to American science"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Asked if they wanted to participate in this research"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The purpose of the study was to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Test a new cure for syphilis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Provide care for people in Tuskegee"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Show  that Black people did not want to be in medical research studies"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Determine if treatment was needed in later stages of the diseases and how it differed in Blacks and Whites"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Tuskegee was chosen for this study because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It was only 100 miles from  the government offices in Atlanta."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It was where the Tuskegee airmen could be used for the experiment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It had a large Black population and a small hospital that served African Americans"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The local white doctors wanted the population to be used for experiments"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The study finally ended in 1972 because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "There was public outrage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The government doctors realized they had done something really wrong"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Black doctors at the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee objected to the study"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The researchers had proven their objectives"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Deep in the bowels of the animal kingdom,\nfarts can serve as tools of intimidation, acts of self-defense, and even\nweapons of malodorous murder. The smelliest parts in the animal kingdom \naren’t lethal, but they might ruin \nyour trip to the beach. Seals and sea lions are well-known for\nhaving truly foul farts due to their diet. Fish and shellfish are incredibly high\nin sulfur. And during digestion, mammalian \ngut bacteria breaks down sulfur and amino acids containing sulfur\nto produce hydrogen disulphide, a gas with a smell resembling rotten eggs. Seals and sea lions can’t help\ntheir funky flatulence, But some animals deploy \ntheir farts strategically. Both the Eastern hognose snake and\nthe Sonoran coral snake use a tactic called cloacal popping. This involves sucking air \ninto their cloaca— a hole used for urinating, defecating \nand reproduction— and then shooting it back out \nwith a loud pop. These pops are no more dangerous\nthan a sea lion’s stench, but they are effective at scaring\noff would-be predators. Meanwhile, the flatulence of beaded \nlacewing larvae are silent and deadly. Their farts contain a class\nof chemical known as allomone that has evolved specifically\nto paralyze termites. In fact, this allomone is so powerful, a single fart can immobilize multiple\ntermites for up to three hours, or even kill them outright. Either way, these toxic farts give \nbeaded lacewing larvae plenty of time to devour prey \nup to three times their size. For some other animals, however,\nholding farts in can be deadly. The Bolson pupfish is a small freshwater\nfish found in northern Mexico. These fish feed on algae and other\nsmall organisms in the sediment. But during the hottest days of the summer, this algae produces a lot of gas. If a pupfish doesn’t fart this gas out, \nit becomes buoyant— making it easy prey for passing birds. And it isn't just predators\nthey have to worry about. Excessive gas buildup can actually\nburst their digestive systems. Researchers have found groups \nof several hundred dead pupfish that failed to fart \nfor their lives. Fortunately for humanity, animal farts can’t directly harm a human—\noutside making us lose our lunch. But in the right circumstances, some animal flatulence can create\nsurprisingly dangerous conditions. In the fall of 2015, a tripped smoke alarm forced a plane to make \nan emergency landing. Upon further inspection, officials\nfound that there was no fire— just the burps and farts of over 2,000\ngoats being transported in the cargo bay. The change in air pressure had caused\nthem to pass gas en masse. Thankfully, this story of farting goats \nhad relatively low costs. But the most dangerous flatulence \nin the world may actually come from a similarly unassuming mammal:\nthe humble cow. There are nearly one billion\ncows in the world, most of them raised specifically\nfor milk and meat. Like goats, cows are ruminants, which means their stomachs \nhave four chambers, allowing them to chew, digest \nand regurgitate their food multiple times. This process helps them extract extra\nnutrients from their food, but it also produces a lot of gas. This is particularly troubling\nbecause one of the gases cows emit is methane, a major greenhouse gas that contributes \nheavily to global warming. One kilogram of methane traps dozens \nof times more heat in the atmosphere than one kilogram of carbon dioxide. And with each cow releasing \nup to 100 kilograms of methane every year, these animals have become \none of the biggest contributors toward climate change. So while other animals may have louder,\nfouler, or even more toxic farts, cow flatulence may be the most\ndangerous gas ever to pass."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What chemical compound is responsible for the rotten egg smell that is typical of seal farts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hydrogen disulphide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hydrogen monoxide"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hydrogen peroxide"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hydrogen chloride"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "For what major bodily function(s) is a cloaca used?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Urination"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Defecation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Reproduction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The allomone-containing farts of the beaded lacewing larvae evolved to affect which group of insects?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Flies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Termites"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Millipedes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Beetles"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of these is not a reason why the build up of gas in Bolson pupfish can be deadly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They float to surface and are easier prey"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It can burst their digestive systems"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Their farts are loud making them more noticeable to predators"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many chambers does the stomach of a ruminant (e.g., cow), have?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 79, "lesson": 17, "title": "What is depression? - Helen M. Farrell", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-depression-helen-m-farrell", "transcript": {"en": "Depression is the leading cause\nof disability in the world. In the United States, close to 10% of adults \nstruggle with depression. But because it's a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand\nthan, say, high cholesterol. One major source of confusion is\nthe difference between having depression and just feeling depressed. Almost everyone feels down\nfrom time to time. Getting a bad grade, losing a job, having an argument, even a rainy day can bring on\nfeelings of sadness. Sometimes there's no trigger at all. It just pops up out of the blue. Then circumstances change, and those sad feelings disappear. Clinical depression is different. It's a medical disorder, and it won't go away \njust because you want it to. It lingers for at least \ntwo consecutive weeks, and significantly interferes \nwith one's ability to work, play, or love. Depression can have a lot\nof different symptoms: a low mood, loss of interest in things\nyou'd normally enjoy, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, poor concentration, restlessness or slowness, loss of energy, or recurrent thoughts of suicide. If you have at least five\nof those symptoms, according to psychiatric guidelines, you qualify for a diagnosis of depression. And it's not just behavioral symptoms. Depression has physical manifestations\ninside the brain. First of all, there are changes that could be seen\nwith the naked eye and X-ray vision. These include smaller frontal lobes\nand hippocampal volumes. On a more microscale, depression is associated \nwith a few things: the abnormal transmission or depletion\nof certain neurotransmitters, especially serotonin, norepinephrine,\nand dopamine, blunted circadian rhythms, or specific changes in the REM\nand slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle, and hormone abnormalities, such as high cortisol and deregulation\nof thyroid hormones. But neuroscientists still don't have\na complete picture of what causes depression. It seems to have to do with a complex\ninteraction between genes and environment, but we don't have a diagnostic tool that can accurately predict where\nor when it will show up. And because depression symptoms\nare intangible, it's hard to know who might look fine\nbut is actually struggling. According to the National Institute\nof Mental Health, it takes the average person\nsuffering with a mental illness over ten years to ask for help. But there are very effective treatments. Medications and therapy complement\neach other to boost brain chemicals. In extreme cases,\nelectroconvulsive therapy, which is like a controlled seizure\nin the patient's brain, is also very helpful. Other promising treatments, like transcranial magnetic stimulation, are being investigated, too. So, if you know someone \nstruggling with depression, encourage them, gently, to seek out\nsome of these options. You might even offer to help\nwith specific tasks, like looking up therapists in the area, or making a list of questions\nto ask a doctor. To someone with depression, these first steps can seem insurmountable. If they feel guilty or ashamed, point out that depression \nis a medical condition, just like asthma or diabetes. It's not a weakness \nor a personality trait, and they shouldn't expect themselves\nto just get over it anymore than they could will themselves\nto get over a broken arm. If you haven't experienced \ndepression yourself, avoid comparing it to times\nyou've felt down. Comparing what they're experiencing\nto normal, temporary feelings of sadness can make them feel guilty for struggling. Even just talking about \ndepression openly can help. For example, research shows that asking\nsomeone about suicidal thoughts actually reduces their suicide risk. Open conversations about mental illness\nhelp erode stigma and make it easier \nfor people to ask for help. And the more patients seek treatment, the more scientists will learn\nabout depression, and the better the treatments will get."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What percentage of the United States population suffers from depression?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What do you call a specialized cell that transmits nerve impulses in the brain?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Receptor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Neuron"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Synapse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neurotransmitter"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What percentage of women experience postpartum depression after giving birth?

{"page": 79, "lesson": 18, "title": "Why you should stop setting goals (yes, really) - Emmanuel Acho", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-you-should-stop-setting-goals-yes-really-emmanuel-acho", "transcript": {"en": "I do not suppose to know everything. And those closest to me, they might say,\nI don't really know much at all, but -- One thing that I know to be true\nbeyond the shadow of a doubt is this. The surest way to fail in life is to set a goal. (Laughter) Now, unfortunately, I found this out\nthrough excruciating pain, but hopefully in the next nine minutes,\nI can convince you, too, that this is true, without the pain. Unless, of course, you consider\nlistening to me painful. OK. The year was 2011. I was seeking to become\na multimillionaire by the age of 21. So how was I going to do this? It was simple. I was going to leave college\nat the University of Texas one year early. I was going to leave after my junior year and declare for the National\nFootball League draft. In order to do this, however, you have to submit your resume to the NFL. A resume in football, it is your highlight tapes\nfrom your years playing prior. So I submitted my football tape\nfrom my freshman, my sophomore and my junior year. The NFL sent me back a letter. It simply read, \"Dear Emmanuel, you will not be drafted\nin the first three rounds.\" Excuse you. I won't be drafted\nin the first three rounds? So what did I do, TED audience? It's simple. I set a goal that day. But you know what they say\nabout goal-setting. You've got to write it down,\ncommit it to memory. So I highlighted the sheet of paper. “Dear Emmanuel, you won’t be drafted\nin the first three rounds,” and I put it above my bed\nin my condo in Austin, Texas. Every morning I woke up, I looked at it. \"Dear Emmanuel, you won't be drafted\nin the first three rounds.\" Every night before I went\nto sleep, I looked at it. \"Dear Emmanuel, you won't be drafted\nin the first three rounds.\" I worked tirelessly\nmy senior year in college with one goal in mind. Be drafted in the first three\nrounds of the NFL draft. Those are the most prestigious\nrounds after all. 6am workouts in college,\nstudy hall, class. I'm doing it all, with one goal in mind. Well, fast forward one year later, I'm at the NFL Combine. The NFL Combine, it is the job interview. I'm in front of 32 billionaires. 32 of the richest men in America, if not the richest men in the world. They are the owners of every NFL team. I'm running the 40-yard dash. The 40-yard dash is one of the testing\nmetrics you use at the NFL Combine with millions of dollars on the line. The faster you run,\nthe higher you get drafted. I take my mark. I proceed to run. I hear pop, pop, pop. I keep running. I think my heels are clicking. Pop, pop, pop. I clutch my quad, I fall to the ground. It was my quad being torn off the bone. (Audience: Oh!) I ripped my quad off the bone, I’m falling [to the] ground in agony in front of these 32 billionaires. I didn't get drafted in the first\nthree rounds of the NFL draft. I made a decision that day,\nin that moment, to stop setting goals. My self-esteem, ruined. Self-efficacy, ruined. That last year of my life\nseemingly gone to waste because I had one goal, y'all. It was simple. Be drafted in the first three rounds. Then I tore my quad,\nand it all fell apart. What I failed to mention thus far\nis why I tore my quad. Two days prior at the NFL Combine, I weighed in at 240 pounds. In the NFL, the bigger\nyou are, the better. But as you all know, weight, it don't move all that fast. So I cut 10 pounds within two days. I ran the 40-yard dash\ntwo days later at 230 pounds, dehydrated, dieted for two days. Why? Because I was so focused on my goal that I caused harm to myself. It's not that goals don't add value. It’s just that the risk of goal-setting, it is greater than the potential reward. Think about it in your own\nlife for a moment. Maybe you had the goal\nof being in a relationship. So you ignore the toxic behavior. Think about it in your own life. See, one of my greatest\naccomplishments to date, being an NFL player, because ultimately\nI did play for four years, I view negatively because I didn't hit my goal. Maybe that's the same for some of you. Maybe you have the goal of reading\na certain amount of books in a year. You've become a much more proficient\nreader, but you didn't hit your goal. Maybe you had a goal of making a certain\namount of money for your business. You are a thriving entrepreneur,\nbut you didn't hit your goal. I left the NFL. I became a content creator where I would live\na much more limitless life. I'll get to that more here in a moment. The question now is why\nin the world do we set goals? Well, first, let's define a goal. A goal, by definition, it is the end towards which effort is aimed. But why would I start something\nwith the end in mind? In working on my master’s degree\nin sports psychology, I focused on goal-setting,\nI wrote my final thesis on it, and I realized we set goals\nfor three primary reasons. The first. We've been indoctrinated with this belief\nthat we have to set a goal to achieve. There's a popularized study,\nwhich has since been debunked, which said the person\nwho writes their goals down and commits them to memory, they will earn twice as much money\nas the person who doesn't. So what you want me to believe is the difference\nbetween one million dollars and 500,000 dollars is this? What you want me to believe is the difference between 100,000 dollars\nand 50,000 dollars is simply this? Can't be. Now, these ideas\naren't completely off-base. The problem is very simple. They're misidentifying\ncausation and correlation. Surely there is a correlation between the person who was willing\nto go the extra mile and write their goal down and the person who's willing to go\nthe extra mile in their business. But no, the reason you're making\ntwice as much money is not because you wrote your goal down. The second reason we set goals, goals give us a North Star. Motivation. As if we'd just be wandering\naround life aimlessly if we didn't set a goal. The final reason we set goals? We have this insatiable\ndesire for feedback. And feedback, it is a predecessor, is a necessary\naspect of goal-setting. Think about it in your own life. Did this Instagram post get as many\nlikes as that Instagram post? Did this tweet get as many likes\nas my last tweet? How about this TikTok post? Did it get as many shares as my last? We have this insatiable\ndesire for feedback. You know, I made a mistake earlier. I said the surest way\nto fail in life is to set a goal. But in all honesty, the only way to fail in life\nis to set a goal. Think about anything\nyou've ever failed at. Maybe relationally,\noccupationally, educationally. That marriage, it ended in divorce. You didn't get into that college\nthat you wanted to. You didn't pass the MCAT,\nyou didn't pass the LSAT, whatever the case may be, it was all tethered to a goal. It's not just that the surest way\nto fail in life is to set a goal. The only way to fail in life\nis to set a goal. So what do I suggest we do instead? Here it is. You have an objective with no limitations. Now I know what you're thinking,\nAcho, that's semantics. No, this small difference will have\na huge impact in your life. Objective: effort aimed in a direction. A goal: the end towards which\nenergy is aimed. Your objective, it should be subjective. It should be subject\nto people's interpretation. That way you do not fail. The theme of this conference\nis Possibilities. You all have spent money,\nleft your homes, maybe children, because somewhere deep down inside you, you subscribe to this notion\nof possibility. But you can't simultaneously subscribe\nto the notion of possibility while still being held captive\nby goal-setting. The laws of goal-setting completely\nundermine the freedom of possibility. So if we're being honest with ourselves,\nwe have to choose one. Because possibility is limitless. But goal-setting, oh,\nit’s fixated on an end. If you want to have\na 10-million dollar business, you'll set that goal. And you might do just that. Have a 10-million dollar business. Congratulations. You'll work towards\na 10-million dollar business. But what if it could have been more? If you want to run a mile\nwithout stopping, you’ll work towards it,\nand you might do just that. Having never known\nif you could have run a marathon. What does it look like practically? Kirk Hammett, lead guitarist\nfor Metallica, he never had the goal\nof winning eight Grammys. He never had the goal\nof selling 125 million records, never had the goal of being a rock star. He simply said, and I quote, \"I just want to play my guitar\na little bit better every day.\" Close quote. See, because with that, there is no end. A goal, by its definition,\nit is focused on an ending, which means inherently a goal is limiting. It's not that goals in\nand of themselves have no value, it's just, what about the damage\nyou have done to yourself, your self-esteem, your self-efficacy, the way in which you view yourself\nwhen you look at yourself? What about that damage? I'm not saying don't achieve. I'm saying achieve limitlessly. I'm saying believe in the reason\nyou were all sitting in here today because you believe in possibility. Let go of the captivity of goal-setting and achieve all\nyou actually have to achieve. So what is my objective\nwith no limitations? Very simply put, to be considered one\nof the most creative people the television industry has ever seen. Because if I would have achieved my goal of being drafted in the first\nthree rounds of the NFL draft, I never would have achieved this. Winning a Primetime Emmy Award\nand sharing that moment with my mom. (Applause) But just as importantly, if I would have achieved my goal of being drafted in the first\nthree rounds of the NFL draft, I wouldn't be standing\nin front of you all today. Why? Because if you hear nothing else, truly, if you hear nothing else, hear this. I'm begging each and every one\nof you to hear this. The goal that you achieve, it's actually the penalty that you receive for having set that goal\nin the first place. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Pryor", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-wind-turbines-work-rebecca-j-barthelmie-and-sara-c-pryor", "transcript": {"en": "Every 24 hours, wind generates \nenough kinetic energy to produce roughly 35 times more \nelectricity than humanity uses each day. And unlike coal or oil, this resource\nis totally renewed each day. So how can we harness this incredible\namount of energy, and is it possible to create a world\npowered entirely by wind? The basic principle of wind energy \nis simple. A series of sails or blades\nmounted around a rotor catch the wind and translate its kinetic energy \ninto rotational energy. Traditional windmills use that rotational\nenergy to grind wheat or pump water. But in modern wind turbines, it turns \na generator that creates electricity. This conversion from wind \nto rotational energy to electricity has defined wind turbines since their \ninvention in the late 19th century. And there are three primary factors \nthat determine just how much energy they can produce: the size and orientation\nof the blades, the blade’s aerodynamic design, \nand the amount of wind turning the rotor. First up, blade orientation. Wind turbines can be designed \nwith their rotor on a vertical axis or a horizontal axis. Vertical blades can pick up wind \ncoming from any direction, but with much less efficiency\nthan horizontal axis rotors. Horizontal designs allow blades to capture\nthe wind’s full force by tracking the wind’s direction \nand turning to face it. This turning process is called yawing, and older windmills achieved it\nthrough manual monitoring. Today, wind sensors and computer systems\nautomatically adjust the blades with expert precision\nto capture as much energy as possible. Outside rotor orientation, the blades themselves need to be\nshaped to maximize efficiency. While early designs used flat blades, modern blades are curved\nlike airplane wings. Wind travels faster over\nthe curved surface, creating a low-pressure pocket \nabove the blade that forces it upwards. Since the amount of lift depends\non the angle at which the wind is moving \nrelative to the blade, modern blades also incorporate a twist, optimizing how much of the blade can cut\ninto the wind. Made of fiberglass and resin layers, \nthese blades are strong enough to operate through rain, lightning, \nand blistering sunlight for over 20 years. Even with aerodynamic blades\nand a horizontal rotor, a wind turbine can only capture wind\nif it's in a windy environment. Wind speeds typically increase the higher\ninto the atmosphere you travel. So today, most turbines are well\nover 100 meters tall, with equally large rotor diameters. A turbine of this height and size can\ncapture a huge amount of wind, generating enough electricity every\nyear to power 750 American homes. A wind farm of 200 similarly sized \nturbines could power over 150,000 American homes—\nor twice as many European homes— for an entire year. Offshore wind farms contain an even\ngreater number of even larger turbines. In 2019, the largest wind turbine \never built began operating off the coast \nof the Netherlands. With a rotor diameter of 220 meters,\njust one of these turbines can meet the annual power needs \nof 16,000 European households. Despite its amazing potential, \nwind energy still faces challenges. Wind may be a free and unlimited fuel, but no matter how large or efficient \na turbine is there's a mathematical limit to how much\nwind it can convert into electricity. German physicist Albert Betz calculated that since some wind must remain \nto keep the blades spinning, a turbine can only ever capture 59.3% \nof the wind’s energy. Additionally, some people feel turbines\ndisrupt natural scenery, and wind energy’s intermittent \navailability can make it difficult to integrate \ninto electrical grids. But even with these challenges,\nmodern wind turbines have made wind energy the most efficient and inexpensive \nsource of electricity. Wind turbines already provide essential\nenergy for communities around the world. And for many farmers, \nhosting a wind turbine can be a reliable source \nof additional income. With continued improvements\nin wind forecasting, electrical grid infrastructure\nand energy storage, wind power might blow away\nall our energy problems."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What electricity generation group is wind energy in?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fossil fuel"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nuclear"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Renewable"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Geothermal"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What kind of energy is captured by wind turbines?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mechanical"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Heat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chemical"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Kinetic"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "If a wind turbine has a hub-height of 100 m, and a rotor diameter of 120 m, what is the greatest height that the blade reaches above the ground?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "120 m"}, {"label": "B", "text": "180 m"}, {"label": "C", "text": "240 m"}, {"label": "D", "text": "160 m (100 + 120/2)"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why are wind turbine blades described as ‘aerodynamic’?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because they fly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because they are designed with a special shape to capture kinetic energy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because they are made of dynamos"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because they have holes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What are wind turbine blades primarily made of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Concrete"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Steel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fiberglass"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wood"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "True or False?

{"page": 79, "lesson": 20, "title": "Why is it so hard to break a bad habit?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-is-it-so-hard-to-break-a-bad-habit", "transcript": {"en": "Billions of people deal with a nail-biting\nhabit at some point in their lives. Many will go to great lengths\nto try to stop, employing strategies like rubbing\nchili peppers on their cuticles, wearing gloves all day,\ndipping their hands in salt, and envisioning bacteria crawling\non their fingers. And while not all of us are nail-biters, most of us do have a habit\nwe'd like to kick. So what's the best way to break one? Scientists define habits as behaviors\nthat are performed regularly, and cued subconsciously in response\nto certain environments, whether it be a location, time of day,\nor even an emotional state. They can include simple actions\nlike picking your hair when stressed, but also more complex practices ingrained\nin daily routines, like staying up late\nor brewing your coffee in the morning. If you do something frequently,\nwithout much deliberation, then it’s likely a habit. They form because at some point your brain\nlearns that the behavior is beneficial. Let's say after opening a stressful email,\nyou bite your nails. This is rewarding,\nas it’s enough to focus your attention, curbing your email fueled anxiety. Within your brain, positive experiences\ncan trigger the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that mediates\nfeelings of pleasure. Dopamine is also a driver\nof neuroplasticity, meaning it can change\nhow your neurons wire and fire. Your brain builds connections\nthat link the reward with the behavior, driving you to repeat it. It also starts associating the behavior\nwith other cues, like your environment. Eventually, all it takes is the context\nof sitting at your desk to subconsciously trigger\na nail-biting habit— no stressful email\nor sense of relief required. Once established,\nthese cue-behavior-reward loops work fast, outpacing the decision-making process. You may find yourself\nengaging in a habit before you have the chance\nto notice and stop. But this can be a good thing\nbecause not all habits are bad. They’re stored memories\nof what’s worked in the past, which allow you to take swift\naction in the present. One study estimated that on average, people spend more than 40% of their days\nperforming regularly repeated behaviors while their minds are occupied\nwith other thoughts. A seemingly automated morning routine,\nfor example, saves you both time\nand precious mental energy. Still, many people have habits\nthat no longer serve them. Yet research shows that intentions alone\noften fail to lead to long-term behavior change. This isn’t to say you can’t break a habit. Rather, by understanding\nthe basis of habits, you can create better plans\nfor changing them. For example, we know habits are often\ncued by environments and routines. Lying in bed may cause you to endlessly\nscroll through your phone, or watching TV on the couch may lead\nyou to grab a sugary snack. One of the most effective ways\nto manage behavior is to identify these locations\nor times of day. Then try to modify them\nby changing your routine or creating obstacles that make\nit more difficult to perform the habit in that space. Moving, switching jobs,\nor even starting a new schedule, are particularly great times\nto break a habit or build a new one. One 2005 study tracked university\nstudents’ exercising, reading, and TV watching habits\nbefore and after they transferred schools. When students were no longer around\nold environments and routines, their habits, even the strong ones,\nsignificantly changed. For behaviors like nail-biting \nor hair-pulling, a practice called habit reversal training\ncan be helpful. Developed by psychologists in the 1970s, the aim is to change a habit\nby replacing it with another one that’s less detrimental. The training requires you to analyze\nand understand your habit cues, so you can effectively intervene\nat the right times. For example, if you tend to bite\nyour nails at work, preemptively keep a fidget toy\nat your desk. Then, if a stressful email comes in, use the toy when you feel\nthe urge to bite your nails. Breaking a habit takes time, so remember to give yourself grace\nand have patience through the process. And while many focus on their bad habits, it’s also worth celebrating the good ones that help us move swiftly and successfully\nthrough our daily routines."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Habits are behaviors that are performed regularly and cued ___ in response to certain environments.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Intermittently"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Unexpectedly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Subconsciously"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Retroactively"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A habit forms when your brain learns that a behavior is ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Addictive"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Beneficial"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Benign"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Attractive"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What role does the brain chemical dopamine play in the process of habit formation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It builds a cue-behavior-reward loop."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It sends stress signals to the body."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It encourages obsessive thoughts and behaviors."}, {"label": "D", "text": "When absent, it leads to feelings of withdrawal.

{"page": 79, "lesson": 21, "title": "For parents, happiness is a very high bar - Jennifer Senior", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/for-parents-happiness-is-a-very-high-bar-jennifer-senior", "transcript": {"en": "When I was born, there was really only one book about how to raise your children, and it was written by Dr. Spock. (Laughter) Thank you for indulging me. I have always wanted to do that. No, it was Benjamin Spock, and his book was called \"The Common\nSense Book of Baby And Child Care.\" It sold almost 50 million copies \nby the time he died. Today, I, as the mother of a six-year-old, walk into Barnes and Noble, and see this. And it is amazing the variety that one finds \non those shelves. There are guides to raising \nan eco-friendly kid, a gluten-free kid, a disease-proof kid, which, if you ask me, is a little bit creepy. There are guides to raising a bilingual kid even if you only speak one language at home. There are guides to raising a financially savvy kid and a science-minded kid and a kid who is a whiz at yoga. Short of teaching your toddler how to defuse a nuclear bomb, there is pretty much a guide to everything. All of these books are well-intentioned. I am sure that many of them are great. But taken together, I am sorry, I do not see help when I look at that shelf. I see anxiety. I see a giant candy-colored monument to our collective panic, and it makes me want to know, why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion? Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing human beings have been doing successfully for millennia, long before parenting message boards and peer-reviewed studies came along? Why is it that so many mothers and fathers experience parenthood as a kind of crisis? Crisis might seem like a strong word, but there is data suggesting it probably isn't. There was, in fact, a paper of just this very name, \"Parenthood as Crisis,\" published in 1957, and in the 50-plus years since, there has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish. Parents experience more stress than non-parents. Their marital satisfaction is lower. There have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they are spending time with their kids, and the answer often is, not so great. Last year, I spoke with a researcher named Matthew Killingsworth who is doing a very, very imaginative project that tracks people's happiness, and here is what he told me he found: \"Interacting with your friends is better than interacting with your spouse, which is better than interacting with other relatives, which is better than interacting with acquaintances, which is better than interacting with parents, which is better than interacting with children. Who are on par with strangers.\" (Laughter) But here's the thing. I have been looking at what underlies these data for three years, and children are not the problem. Something about parenting right now at this moment is the problem. Specifically, I don't think we know what parenting is supposed to be. Parent, as a verb, only entered common usage in 1970. Our roles as mothers and fathers have changed. The roles of our children have changed. We are all now furiously improvising our way through a situation for which there is no script, and if you're an amazing jazz musician, then improv is great, but for the rest of us, it can kind of feel like a crisis. So how did we get here? How is it that we are all now navigating a child-rearing universe without any norms to guide us? Well, for starters, there has been a major historical change. Until fairly recently, kids worked, on our farms primarily, but also in factories, mills, mines. Kids were considered economic assets. Sometime during the Progressive Era, we put an end to this arrangement. We recognized kids had rights, we banned child labor, we focused on education instead, and school became a child's new work. And thank God it did. But that only made a parent's role more confusing in a way. The old arrangement might not have been particularly ethical, but it was reciprocal. We provided food, clothing, shelter, and moral instruction to our kids, and they in return provided income. Once kids stopped working, the economics of parenting changed. Kids became, in the words of one brilliant if totally ruthless sociologist, \"economically worthless but emotionally priceless.\" Rather than them working for us, we began to work for them, because within only a matter of decades it became clear: if we wanted our kids to succeed, school was not enough. Today, extracurricular activities are a kid's new work, but that's work for us too, because we are the ones\ndriving them to soccer practice. Massive piles of homework are a kid's new work, but that's also work for us, because we have to check it. About three years ago, a Texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart. She said, almost casually, \"Homework is the new dinner.\" The middle class now pours all of its time and energy and resources into its kids, even though the middle class has less and less of those things to give. Mothers now spend more time with their children than they did in 1965, when most women were not even in the workforce. It would probably be easier for parents to do their new roles if they knew what they were preparing their kids for. This is yet another thing that\nmakes modern parenting so very confounding. We have no clue what portion our wisdom, if any, is of use to our kids. The world is changing so rapidly, it's impossible to say. This was true even when I was young. When I was a kid, high school specifically, I was told that I would be at sea in the new global economy if I did not know Japanese. And with all due respect to the Japanese, it didn't turn out that way. Now there is a certain kind of middle-class parent that is obsessed with teaching their kids Mandarin, and maybe they're onto something, but we cannot know for sure. So, absent being able to anticipate the future, what we all do, as good parents, is try and prepare our kids for every possible kind of future, hoping that just one of our efforts will pay off. We teach our kids chess, thinking maybe they will need analytical skills. We sign them up for team sports, thinking maybe they will need collaborative skills, you know, for when they go\nto Harvard Business School. We try and teach them to be financially savvy and science-minded and eco-friendly and gluten-free, though now is probably a good time to tell you that I was not eco-friendly and gluten-free as a child. I ate jars of pureed macaroni and beef. And you know what? I'm doing okay. I pay my taxes. I hold down a steady job. I was even invited to speak at TED. But the presumption now is that what was good enough for me,\nor for my folks for that matter, isn't good enough anymore. So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf, because we feel like if we aren't trying everything, it's as if we're doing nothing and we're defaulting on our obligations to our kids. So it's hard enough to navigate our new roles as mothers and fathers. Now add to this problem something else: we are also navigating new roles as husbands and wives because most women today are in the workforce. This is another reason, I think, that parenthood feels like a crisis. We have no rules, no scripts, no norms for what to do when a child comes along now that both mom and dad are breadwinners. The writer Michael Lewis once put this very, very well. He said that the surest way for a couple to start fighting is for them to go out to dinner with another couple whose division of labor is ever so slightly different from theirs, because the conversation in\nthe car on the way home goes something like this: \"So, did you catch that Dave is the one who walks them to school every morning?\" (Laughter) Without scripts telling us who does what in this brave new world, couples fight, and both mothers and fathers each have their legitimate gripes. Mothers are much more likely to be multi-tasking when they are at home, and fathers, when they are at home, are much more likely to be mono-tasking. Find a guy at home, and odds are he is doing just one thing at a time. In fact, UCLA recently did a study looking at the most common configuration of family members in middle-class homes. Guess what it was? Dad in a room by himself. According to the American Time Use Survey, mothers still do twice as much childcare as fathers, which is better than it was in Erma Bombeck's day, but I still think that something she wrote is highly relevant: \"I have not been alone in the\nbathroom since October.\" (Laughter) But here is the thing: Men are doing plenty. They spend more time with their kids than their fathers ever spent with them. They work more paid hours, on average, than their wives, and they genuinely want to be good, involved dads. Today, it is fathers, not mothers, who report the most work-life conflict. Either way, by the way, if you think it's hard for traditional families to sort out these new roles, just imagine what it's like now for non-traditional families: families with two dads, families with two moms, single-parent households. They are truly improvising as they go. Now, in a more progressive country, and forgive me here for capitulating to cliché and invoking, yes, Sweden, parents could rely on the state for support. There are countries that acknowledge the anxieties and the changing roles of mothers and fathers. Unfortunately, the United States is not one of them, so in case you were wondering what the U.S. has in common with Papua New Guinea and Liberia, it's this: We too have no paid maternity leave policy. We are one of eight known countries that does not. In this age of intense confusion, there is just one goal upon which all parents can agree, and that is whether they are tiger moms or hippie moms, helicopters or drones, our kids' happiness is paramount. That is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless but emotionally priceless. We are all the custodians of their self-esteem. The one mantra no parent ever questions is, \"All I want is for my children to be happy.\" And don't get me wrong: I think happiness is a wonderful goal for a child. But it is a very elusive one. Happiness and self-confidence, teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field. It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike. There's no curriculum for it. Happiness and self-confidence can\nbe the byproducts of other things, but they cannot really be goals unto themselves. A child's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent. And happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid. And I have to tell you, I think it leads to some very strange excesses. We are now so anxious to protect our kids from the world's ugliness that we now shield them from \"Sesame Street.\" I wish I could say I was kidding about this, but if you go out and you buy the first few episodes of \"Sesame Street\" on DVD, as I did out of nostalgia, you will find a warning at the beginning saying that the content is not suitable for children. (Laughter) Can I just repeat that? The content of the original \"Sesame Street\" is not suitable for children. When asked about this by The New York Times, a producer for the show gave\na variety of explanations. One was that Cookie Monster smoked a pipe in one skit and then swallowed it. Bad modeling. I don't know. But the thing that stuck with me is she said that she didn't know whether Oscar the Grouch could be invented today because he was too depressive. I cannot tell you how much this distresses me. (Laughter) You are looking at a woman who has a periodic table of the Muppets hanging from her cubicle wall. The offending muppet, right there. That's my son the day he was born. I was high as a kite on morphine. I had had an unexpected C-section. But even in my opiate haze, I managed to have one very clear thought the first time I held him. I whispered it into his ear. I said, \"I will try so hard not to hurt you.\" It was the Hippocratic Oath, and I didn't even know I was saying it. But it occurs to me now that the Hippocratic Oath is a much more realistic aim than happiness. In fact, as any parent will tell you, it's awfully hard. All of us have said or done hurtful things that we wish to God we could take back. I think in another era we did not expect quite so much from ourselves, and it is important that we all remember that the next time we are staring with our hearts racing at those bookshelves. I'm not really sure how to create new norms for this world, but I do think that in our desperate quest to create happy kids, we may be assuming the wrong moral burden. It strikes me as a better goal, and, dare I say, a more virtuous one, to focus on making productive kids and moral kids, and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of the good that they do and their accomplishments and the love that they feel from us. That, anyway, is one response to having no script. Absent having new scripts, we just follow the oldest ones in the book -- decency, a work ethic, love — and let happiness and self-esteem\ntake care of themselves. I think if we all did that, the kids would still be all right, and so would their parents, possibly in both cases even better. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Using two new facilities, they planned to provide more than 50%\nof their nation’s water supply by recycling wastewater. And yes, we do mean that wastewater. While this might seem\nlike a desperate decision, this program had been\nplanned for decades to ensure the island nation\nnever ran out of clean water. And today, as climate change\nincreases the frequency and duration of droughts worldwide, more and more regions\nare facing this problem. But is it really safe to reuse anything\nwe flush down the toilet? To answer this, we have to understand exactly\nwhat’s inside this cloudy cocktail. Wastewater is classified\ninto several types, but the primary three are: gray water used\nin sinks, bathing, and laundry; yellow water containing just urine; and black water which has\ncome into contact with feces. Globally, we generate enough wastewater to fill about 400,000 Olympic-sized\nswimming pools every day. In cities and towns with sewage systems, this wastewater combines\nin underground pipes, which actually aren’t filled with feces. The average 4,000 liters\nof sewage contains only a single liter\nof solid fecal material. But sewage is still rife\nwith dangerous contaminants, including billions of pathogens\nand microorganisms, trace chemicals,\nand excess inorganic nutrients that can pollute rivers and lakes. So even if we aren’t planning\nto drink this concoction, we still need to clean it; which is why sewer systems typically\nrun to wastewater treatment plants. Most plants remove major contaminants such as feces, pathogens,\nand excess nitrogen from all the water they process. And this involves a ton of biological,\nchemical, and physical interventions. Some of the most important include\nsettling tanks to remove large particles, biological reaction tanks where microbes\neat unwanted materials, and chemical disinfection processes\nthat kill pathogens. After these procedures,\ntypical treated wastewater in the US is already cleaner than most\nnatural bodies of water, making it safe to discharge\ninto rivers and lakes. If we plan on reusing the water\nfor non-potable purposes, such as irrigation or washing cars, it gets even further disinfected \nto prevent bacteria from growing during storage. But if we want it clean enough to drink, there's much more treatment to be done. One common process\nincludes microfiltration, where membranes with pores\none millionth of a meter across filter out small particles\nand larger microorganisms. Next, the water passes through an even\nfiner reverse osmosis membrane, which can remove particles as small\nas a tenth of a billionth of a meter. This membrane is semi-permeable,\nallowing water to pass through, but stopping things like salt, viruses,\nor unwanted chemicals. After this stage, UV lamps are\nplunged into the water, emitting radiation that\npermanently damages the genetic material\nof any lingering life forms. Sometimes UV disinfection is then combined\nwith further disinfection processes that use chemicals like hydrogen peroxide to handle a wide range\nof microorganisms and micropollutants. At this point, the treated wastewater\nis tested rigorously. And if it passes, it can safely enter\nthe typical pipeline for drinking water, going through the standard\ntreatment procedures before joining the municipal supply. This approach is called\ndirect potable reuse, but even though it’s perfectly healthy, there’s still some concern\nwith such a direct system. Instead, most places opt\nfor indirect potable reuse, where the treated wastewater is discharged\nto an environmental buffer, such as a reservoir, lake, wetland,\nor groundwater aquifer. After some time in this environment, any lingering chemicals\nfrom the treatment process will diffuse and degrade. Then, the water can be extracted\nand enter the drinking water pipeline. Indirect potable reuse is the\nprocess used in Singapore, and it's become an increasingly common\nlifeline for arid regions in the US. But this system is only feasible in places\nwith centralized sewer systems and infrastructure for pumping\nwater into people's homes. This means it can’t help communities dealing with the most serious\nsanitation issues, where access to clean water\nis a daily struggle. Researchers are investigating smaller\nscale technologies to recycle sewage into potable water on site. But helping these communities\nin the long term will require us to take a closer look\nat all the water we’ve been wasting."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Water that comes from sinks, showers, and laundry is called ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yellow water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Brown water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gray water"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Toilet water"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Wastewater treatment plants remove ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pathogenic microorganisms"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Organic materials"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Solids and particles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Wastewater treatment plants use processes such as ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Settling "}, {"label": "B", "text": "Biological processes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chemical processes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Typical processes that are used to make wastewater reusable include ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Microfiltration"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reverse osmosis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Disinfection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Water treated to the level required for drinking is typically coursed through an environmental buffer such as a lake or reservoir.

{"page": 79, "lesson": 23, "title": "The psychology of post-traumatic stress disorder - Joelle Maletis", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-psychology-of-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-joelle-maletis", "transcript": {"en": "Many of us will experience some kind \nof trauma during our lifetime. Sometimes, we escape \nwith no long-term effects. But for millions of us, \nthose experiences linger, causing symptoms like flashbacks, nightmares, and negative thoughts \nthat interfere with everyday life. This phenomenon, \ncalled post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, isn’t a personal failing; rather, it’s a treatable malfunction \nof certain biological mechanisms that allow us to cope \nwith dangerous experiences. To understand PTSD, we first need to understand how the brain \nprocesses a wide range of ordeals, including the death of a loved one, domestic violence, injury or illness, abuse, rape, war, car accidents, and natural disasters. These events can bring on feelings \nof danger and helplessness, which activate the brain’s alarm system, known as \nthe “fight-flight-freeze” response. When this alarm sounds, the hypothalamic, pituitary, \nand adrenal systems, known as the HPA axis, work together to send signals \nto the autonomic nervous system. That’s the network that communicates \nwith adrenal glands and internal organs to help regulate functions like\nheart rate, digestion, and respiration. These signals start a chemical cascade that floods the body with several \ndifferent stress hormones, causing physiological changes \nthat prepare the body to defend itself. Our heart rate speeds up, breathing quickens, and muscles tense. Even after a crisis is over, escalated levels of stress hormones \nmay last for days, contributing to jittery feelings, nightmares, and other symptoms. For most people, these experiences\ndisappear within a few days to two weeks as their hormone levels stabilize. But a small percentage of those\nwho experience trauma have persistent problems —sometimes vanishing temporarily \nonly to resurface months later. We don’t completely understand \nwhat’s happening in the brain, but one theory is that \nthe stress hormone cortisol may be continuously activating \nthe “fight-flight-freeze” response while reducing overall brain functioning,\nleading to a number of negative symptoms. These symptoms often fall \ninto four categories: intrusive thoughts, \nlike dreams and flashbacks, avoiding reminders of the trauma, negative thoughts and feelings,\nlike fear, anger, and guilt, and “reactive” symptoms like irritability \nand difficulty sleeping. Not everyone has all these symptoms, or experiences them to the same extent \nand intensity. When problems last more than a month, \nPTSD is often diagnosed. Genetics, on-going overwhelming stress, and many risk factors \nlike preexisting mental illnesses or lack of emotional support, likely play a role in determining \nwho will experience PTSD. But the underlying cause \nis still a medical mystery. A major challenge of coping \nwith PTSD is sensitivity to triggers, physical and emotional stimuli that the brain associates \nwith the original trauma. These can be everyday sensations \nthat aren’t inherently dangerous but prompt powerful physical \nand emotional reactions. For example, the smell of a campfire could evoke the memory of being trapped \nin a burning house. For someone with PTSD, that memory activates the same\nneurochemical cascade as the original event. That then stirs up the same feelings \nof panic and helplessness as if they’re experiencing \nthe trauma all over again. Trying to avoid these triggers,\nwhich are sometimes unpredictable, can lead to isolation. That can leave people feeling invalidated, ignored, or misunderstood, like a pause button has been\npushed on their lives while the rest of the world \ncontinues around them. But, there are options. If you think you might \nbe suffering from PTSD, the first step is an evaluation \nwith a mental health professional who can direct you towards \nthe many resources available. Psychotherapy can \nbe very effective for PTSD, helping patients better \nunderstand their triggers. And certain medications \ncan make symptoms more manageable, as can self- care practices,\nlike mindfulness and regular exercise. What if you notice signs of PTSD \nin a friend or family member? Social support, acceptance, and\nempathy are key to helping and recovery. Let them know you believe their\naccount of what they’re experiencing, and that you don’t blame them \nfor their reactions. If they’re open to it, encourage them to seek evaluation \nand treatment. PTSD has been called “the hidden wound” because it comes \nwithout outward physical signs. But even if it’s an invisible disorder, \nit doesn’t have to be a silent one."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The brain’s alarm system is known as the _______ response.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "HPA axis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Flight-fight-freeze response"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cortisol response"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neurochemical response"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The HPA axis is a combination of the _______, _______, and _______ systems.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hippocampus, adrenal, and stress"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hypothalamic, stress, and adrenal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hippocampus, pituitary, and adrenal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hypothalamic, pituitary, and adrenal"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "PTSD symptoms fall into _______ categories.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In order for PTSD to be diagnosed, negative symptoms must appear for more than one _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Month"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Week"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Day"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Year"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Triggers are known as _______ that happen when a traumatic event is re-experienced.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Neurochemical cascades"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cortisol stress hormonal release"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Physical and emotional stimuli"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Flight-fight-freeze response"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
