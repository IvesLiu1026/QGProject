{"page": 54, "lesson": 2, "title": "Calcium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/emJRuSTg", "transcript": {"en": "Calcium is the third element in group two\non the periodic table. It’s really very common. We find it all over the world in all\nsorts of minerals. So for example you can have bones, this is a pelvis of a sheep, I\nfound it when I was walking one day, you can see the legs go in there and there. In here we have some calcium turnings. We’re\nstoring them in our glove box. This glove box here is a contraption full of nitrogen,\nit’s dry nitrogen so that we can keep our calcium away from oxygen and away from moisture\nas well, because obviously what we don’t want is when we get our nice very reactive\ncalcium surface we don’t want it to tarnish from oxides too quickly before we can react\nit with things. So what we have here inside the bottle are turnings of calcium. Calcium\nis quite hard compared to sort of the heavier group two elements, so strontium and barium,\nso it’s harder to file. Bones are made from calcium phosphate mixed\nwith some organic material as well and they’re very strong because of the structure within\nthe bones. There are all sorts of shells of molluscs and the like where they use calcium\ncarbonate from the sea water, getting the calcium out, reacting with carbon dioxide\nand making their shells. And because shells are made out of calcium carbonate, which dissolves\nin acid, people are quite worried about the effects of global warming. Not the heating\nup but when the C02 dissolves into the sea it makes it more acid, so in principle shells\ncould start dissolving and some molluscs may not be able to survive because they just can’t\nmake their shells. If I just pour them out so you can see. Calcium looks metallic than the calcium metal\nitself because of the way the electrons behave in the solid. In fact it is because it is\na very good electrical conductor but the compounds are all white, because calcium has no free\nelectrons that can go from one energy level to another in the way you can say with copper.\nSo copper sulphate is a beautiful blue colour, calcium sulphate is white, and it’s actually\ncolourless, so if you see a big crystal of calcium sulphate it just looks like glass.\nBut the white is caused by very small crystals which scatter the light, just in the same\nway that any sort of white powder will scatter light, flour for example or talcum powder,\nanything like that. Calcium compounds themselves are actually\nmostly white, but calcium metal itself, as you can see we’ve got tarnished parts but\nalso there are some shiny bits where it’s untarnished. So you’re actually seeing the\nmetal the lustre of the metal there as well. Calcium carbonate dissolves in water saturated\nwith C02 to make calcium bicarbonate which is more soluble. And so you can get water,\nso called hard water, that has quite high levels of calcium. And when this percolates\nthrough the ground and comes to a cave it can then crystallise out and you can get hanging\ndown pillars of calcium carbonate, which are called stalactites. And you can have pillars\ngrowing from the floor called stalagmites. This is a stalagmite from Turkey. One of my\nfriends called Hugh was really naughty. He knew I was interested in minerals and he broke\nthis off from a cave in Turkey about 45 years ago and brought it and gave it to me so I\nwas really pleased. And you can see the outside looks quite blobby, and inside you can see\nthere are nice crystals of calcium carbonate because it has grown very, very slowly and\nso it can crystalise. And sometimes these stalagmites and stalactites can grow really\nbig. And more recently, in the last few years, people have found huge crystals of calcium\nsulphate under the ground. Some of you may have seen pictures of caves in Mexico where\nthere are crystals big enough you can actually walk along them. So there is no danger that\ncalcium will ever run out, it’s the basis of cements and concretes, or one of the bases\nbecause then you need other elements like iron and silica to make the concrete itself,\nbut calcium is one of the principle components. We’re going to take calcium chloride, put\nit in a flame and do a flame test and see if we can see the colour of the calcium in\nthe flame. So as I said before about calcium compounds, calcium compounds are often white,\nand here is a white calcium compound. So I’m going to put it in the flame and see if we\nget any colour. Oh hello, that looks quite red doesn’t it? Brick red is the classic\ncalcium colour. Bit orangey to me, might be a bit of sodium in there, or something like\nthat. That was our calcium flame test. The reason that you don’t find lumps of\ncalcium metal lying around, the way you do with copper or gold, is that metallic calcium\nis very reactive, reacts with water very quickly. Magnesium doesn’t react because it has a\nlayer of oxide on the surface, so surprisingly magnesium is not nearly as reactive as calcium.\nYou can use magnesium, or its alloys, for the wheels on your car, go round really fast\nbecause they’re light. You couldn’t have calcium wheels in your car, well you could,\nbut the first time it rained your whole car would go up in flames. This again what we’ve got is our calcium\nchloride, hydrated calcium chloride. We’ve got a bunch of it on this spatula. I’ll\nput it in the flame so that you can see that it’s burning with a brick red flame which\nis characteristic of calcium. It’s kind of a bit orangey to me as well actually, might\nbe a bit of sodium or something in there. Got anymore in there? A little bit. Many people see calcium as a very English\nelement, unlike strontium which was discovered in Scotland, because of the white cliffs of\nDover, the gateway for many people when they first come to England. They’re made of calcium\ncarbonate. And so this white colour of chalk is very characteristic and all over the southern\npart of England you find large amounts of chalk, which in the north of England they\ntend to be limestone, which is also calcium carbonate but a slightly different variety\nof calcium carbonate so it’s a yellow or honey colour because of the impurities of\niron or some other element that’s in it. Well you need calcium for all sorts of processes\nin the body and of course to build up your bones. Particularly, say in the case of pregnant\nwomen, they need to have calcium for the bones of the developing baby. But as people get\nolder the calcium can come out of their bones and make them very fragile, this is why elderly\npeople sometimes break their hips and break their bones so easily. So drinking milk and\neating other sources of calcium are good because it helps you replenish your bones and keep\na reasonable level of calcium."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What could be a terrible consequence of global warming for shellfish (molluscs)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They could die because the higher temperature of seawater"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They could have difficulty finding food for the warmer seawater"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Their shells could dissolve due to the acidification of seawater by CO\n2"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

used to embark on these imaginary Journeys to find Intergalactic object from Planet Krypton which was a lot of fun but didn't need much result when I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science to find a more useful truth I started my journey in California with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of student in an old yearbook and tried to measure their success and wellbeing throughout their life but by measuring the student Smiles researcher were able to predict how fulfilling and longlasting a subject marriage will be how well she would score in standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others in another yearbook I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture when I first saw his picture I thought that his superpowers came from his super color but now I know it was all in a smile another aha moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University uh research project that looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of major league players the researchers found that the span of a player's smile could actually predict the span of his life players who didn't smile in their pictures lived an average of only 72.9 years where players with beaming Smiles lived an average of almost 80 years the good news is that we're actually born smiling using 3D ultrasound technology we can now see that developing babies appear to smile even in the womb when they're born babies continue to smile initially mostly in their sleep and even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice smiling is one of the most basic biologically uniform expressions of all humans in studies he conducted in Papa new guini Paul emman the world most renowned researcher on facial expression found that even members of the fory tribe who were completely disconnected from Western culture and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals attributed smile to descriptions of situation the same way you and I would so from Papa nug guini to Hollywood all the way to Modern Art in Beijing we smile often and use smile to express joy and satis action how many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day raise your hand if you do oh wow outside of this room more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day whereas less than 14% of us smile less than five in fact those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children who Smile as many as 400 times per day have you ever wondered why being around children who smile SM so frequently make you smile very often a research study at oopsa University in Sweden found that it's very difficult to fra when looking at someone who Smiles you ask why because smiling is evolutionary contagious and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically help us understand whether a smile is fake or real so we can understand the emotional state of The Smiler in a recent mimicking study at the University of claron Fon in France subject were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles without the pencil subjects were excellent judges but with the pencil in their mouth when they could not mimic the smile they saw their judgment was impaired in addition to theorizing on evolution in the Origin of Species Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response Theory his theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good uh in his study Darwin actually cited the French neurologist Julian duam who used electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate Smiles please don't try this at home in a related jour study researchers used fmri Imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles the finding supported Darwin's theory but by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even Chocolat a well regarded pleasure inducer cannot match British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate wait the same study found the smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to 16,000 Sterling in cash that's like 25 Grand of smile it's not bad and think about it this way 25,000 * 4 400 quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day and unlike lots of chocolate lots of smiling can actually make you healthier smiling can help reduce the level of stress enhancing hormones like cortisol adrenaline and dopamine increase the level of mood enhancing hormones like endorphin and reduce overall blood pressure and if that's not enough smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others a research study at Penn State University found that when you smile you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous but you're actually appear to be more competent so whenever you want to look great and competent reduce your stress or improve your marriage or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high quality chocolate without incurring the caloric cost or as if you found 25 Grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer healthier

Moore", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/dead-stuff-the-secret-ingredient-in-our-food-chain-john-c-moore", "transcript": {"en": "If someone called you scum, you'd probably be offended, but scientifically, they might not be far off. Have you ever thought about where your food comes from? You might say it comes from plants, animals, or even fungi, but you'd probably rather not think about the rotting organisms and poop that feed those plants, animals, and fungi. So really, you and most of the matter in your body are just two or three degrees of separation from things like pond scum. All species in an ecosystem, from the creatures in a coral reef to the fish in a lake to the lions on the savannah, are directly or indirectly nourished by dead stuff. Most of the organic matter in our bodies, if we trace it back far enough, comes from CO2 and water through photosynthesis. Plants use the energy from sunlight to transform carbon dioxide and water from the environment into glucose and oxygen. That glucose is then transformed into more complex organic molecules to form leaves, stems, roots, fruit, and so on. The energy stored in these organic molecules supports the food chains with which we're familiar. You've probably seen illustrations like this or this. These green food chains start with living plants at their base. But in real-life terrestrial ecosystems, less than 10% of plant matter is eaten while it's still alive. What about the other 90? Well, just look at the ground on an autumn day. Living plants shed dead body parts: fallen leaves, broken branches, and even underground roots. Many plants are lucky enough to go their whole lives without being eaten, eventually dying and leaving remains. All of these uneaten, undigested, and dead plant parts, that 90% of terrestrial plant matter? That becomes detritus, the base of what we call the brown food chain, which looks more like this. What happens to plants also happens to all other organisms up the food chain: some are eaten alive, but most are eaten only when they're dead and rotting. And all along this food chain, living things shed organic matter and expel digestive waste before dying and leaving their remains to decay. All that death sounds grim, right? But it's not. All detritus is ultimately consumed by microbes and other scavengers, so it actually forms the base of the brown food chain that supports many other organisms, including us. Scientists are learning that this detritus is an unexpectedly huge energy source, fueling most natural ecosystems. But the interactions within an ecosystem are even more complex than that. What a food chain really represents is a single pathway of energy flow. And within any ecosystem, many of these flows are linked together to form a rich network of interactions, or food web, with dead matter supporting that network at every step. The resulting food web is so connected that almost every species is no more than two degrees from detritus, even us humans. You probably don't eat rotting things, poop, or pond scum directly, but your food sources probably do. Many animals we eat either feed directly on detritus themselves, like pork, poultry, mushrooms, shellfish, or catfish and other bottom feeders, or they are fed animal by-products. So, if you're thinking nature is full of waste, you're right. But one organism's garbage is another's gold, and all that rotting dead stuff ultimately provides the energy that nourishes us and most of life on Earth, as it passes through the food web. Now that's some food for thought."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What percentage, on average, of living plant biomass on land is consumed alive by herbivores?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More than 75%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "25%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Less than 10%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following terms refer to an organism that consumes non-living organic material?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Herbivore"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Predator"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Detritivore"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mutualist"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Detritus is defined as ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dead plant biomass"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Feces and waste from animal metabolism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dead animal biomass"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What molecule from the atmosphere is captured during photosynthesis to generate plant food and biomass?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "CH4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "CO2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "H2O"}, {"label": "D", "text": "C6H12O6"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

One day, you notice that the honey\nyou slather on your morning toast is more expensive. Instead of switching to jam, you investigate the reason\nfor the price hike. What you find is shocking. The number of domesticated\nhoneybees in the US has been decreasing at an alarming rate. This decline appears too big to be explained by the usual causes\nof bee death alone: disease, parasites or starvation. A typical crime scene\nhas almost no adult bees left in the hive, except, perhaps, a lonely queen\nand a few other survivors. It's full of untouched food stores\nand a brood of unborn larvae, suggesting that the adults vacated\nwithout waiting for them to hatch. But what's particularly eerie is that there's no tell-tale mass\nof dead or dying bees nearby. Either they have forgotten\ntheir way back to the hive, or they have simply disappeared. These mysterious\ndisappearances aren't new. Humans have been collecting\nhoney for centuries. But it wasn't until European settlers\nin the 1600's introduced the subspecies, \nApis mellifera, that we domesticated bees. Since the 19th century, beekeepers have reported\noccasional mass disappearances, giving them enigmatic names like disappearing disease,\nspring dwindle disease and autumn collapse. But when in 2006 such losses \nwere found to affect more than half of all hives in the US, the phenomenon got a new name: colony collapse disorder. The most frightening thing \nabout this mystery isn't that we'll have to go back \nto using regular sugar in our tea. We farm bees for their honey, but they also pollinate our crops \non an industrial scale, generating over 1/3 of America's \nfood production this way. So, how can we find \nthe culprit behind this calamity? Here are three of the possible offenders. Exhibit A: Pests and Disease. Most infamous is the varroa mite, a minuscule red pest that not only \ninvades colonies and feeds on bees, but also transfers pathogens \nthat stunt bee growth and shortens their life span. Exhibit B: Genetics. The queen is the core of a healthy hive. But nowadays, the millions \nof queen bees distributed in commercial hives are bred \nfrom just a few original queens, which raises the worry about \na lack of genetic diversity which could weaken bees' defenses \nagainst pathogens and pests. Exhibit C: Chemicals. Pesticides used both\non commercial beehives and agricultural crops \nto ward off parasites could be getting into the food \nand water that honeybees consume. Researchers have even found\nthat some pesticides damage the honeybees' homing abilities. So we have a file full of clues but no clear leads. In reality, scientists, \nthe actual detectives on this case, face disagreement over what causes \ncolony collapse disorder. For now, we assume that \nseveral factors are the cause. Honeybees aren't necessarily \nin danger of extinction, but fewer bees overall means\nless pollination and higher food costs, so it's crucial that scientists solve \nthe case of the vanishing bees. Because while having less honey \nmight be a buzzkill, crop shortages are something\nthat would truly sting."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In affected colonies ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "There is no queen bee"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The food stores remain untouched"}, {"label": "C", "text": "There are dead bees everywhere"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The comb has disintegrated"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Colony collapse disorder will only affect the price of honey.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When was colony collapse disorder found to affect over half the commercial hives in the United States?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2006"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1884"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2001"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1996"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Since when have humans domesticated bees?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "200 years ago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The early 1900s"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1850"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The 1600s"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Honeybees generate over one third of food in the United States by pollinating crops.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 54, "lesson": 6, "title": "Silk, the ancient material of the future - Fiorenzo Omenetto", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/silk-the-ancient-material-of-the-future-fiorenzo-omenetto", "transcript": {"en": "[Music] [Applause] thank you and thrilled thrilled to be here I'm going to talk about a new old material that still continues to amaze us and that my impact the way we think about material science high-technology and maybe along the way also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation so that's kind of a bold statement I'll tell you a little bit more this material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true it's sustainable it's a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature and it's biodegradable with the clock so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water and have it stable for years it's edible it's implantable in the human body without causing any immune response it actually gets reintegrated in the body and its technological so it can do things like micro electronics and maybe photonics you and the material looks something like this in fact this this material you see is clear and transparent this is the components of this material are just water and protein so this material is is silk and it's so it's kind of different from what we're used to thinking about it's okay and so the question is how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia the process of discovery generally is inspired by nature and so we marvel at silkworm the silkworm that you see here spinning its fiber the so current does a remarkable thing uses these two ingredients protein and water that are in its gland to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection so comparable to technical fibers like like Kevlar and so in the reverse engineering process that we know about and that we're familiar with in for for the textile industry the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things we want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar and to this natural Kevlar so so the inside is is is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material and this is an insight that came about two decades ago from from a person that I'm very they're very fortunate to work with David Kaplan and so we get the starting material and so the starting material is back to the basic building block and then we use this to do a variety of things like for example that films and we take advantage of something that is very simple the recipe to make those films is is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do they find their way to self-assemble so the recipe is simple you take the silk solution you pour it and you wait for the protein to self-assemble and then you detach the protein you get this film as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates but I mentioned that the film is also technological and so what does that mean it means that that you can you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology like like the micro electronics and and nanoscale technology and the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that the silk silk follows very very subtle topographies of the surface which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale so it would be able to replicate the information that is on that is on the DVD and we can store information this film of water and proteins so we tried something out and we wrote a message and a piece of silk which is right here and the message is over there and much like in the DVD you can read it out optically and this requires a stable hand so this is what I decided to do it on stage in front of a thousand people ok so so let me see so as you see the the film going transparently through there and then [Music] and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that so once you have once you have these these these attributes of this material then you can do you can do a lot of things it's actually not limited to films and so the material can assume a lot of formats and then you kind of go a little crazy and so you do various optical components or you do micro prism arrays like the ones that you have you know the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes or you can do beautiful things that if if the camera can capture you can make you can add a third dimensionality to to the film and if the angle is right you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk but you can do other things you can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light and so we've made optical fibers and and but silk is versatile and it kind of goes beyond optics and so you can think of different formats so for instance if you're afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle we do micro needle arrays what you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needles made of silk just to give you a sense of size you can do bigger things you can do gears and nuts and bolts that you can buy at Whole Foods and and the gears work in water as well so is to think of alternative mechanical parts and maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins for example or maybe an entire bone and so you have here a little example of a small skull and we call mini Yorick but you can do things like cups for example and so if you add a little bit of gold if you added a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods you can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap or you know if your fashion for some silk led tattoos so there's versatility and as you see in the material formats that you can that you can do with that with silk but there are still some unique traits I mean why would you want to do all these things and so for real now you mentioned it briefly at the beginning the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible and you see here a picture of a tissue section and so what does that mean that it's the display degree than when compatible you can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted which means with all the devices that you you've seen before in all the formats in principle can can be implanted and and disappear and what you see there in the tissue section in fact as you see that reflector tape so much like you're seen at night by a car then the ideas that you can see if you illuminate tissue you can see deeper parts of tissue because there's that reflective tape there that is that a silk and you see there it gets reintegrated in tissue and reintegration in the human body is not the only thing but reintegration in the environment is important so you have a clock you have protein and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt and unlike unlike the polystyrene cups that that unfortunately fill our landfills every day it's edible so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food it doesn't taste good so I'm gonna need some help for that but probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle silk during its self-assembly process it acts like a cocoon for biological matter and so if you change the recipe and you add things when you're poor so you add things to your liquid silk solution where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines then the the self-assembly process preserves a biological function of these dopants so it makes the materials that environmentally active and an interactive so that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together fractured bone together and deliver drugs at the same time while your bone is healing for example or or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge so we've made a silk card with penicillin in it and we stored penicillin at sixty degrees C so at 140 degrees Fahrenheit for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin and so that could be that could be potentially a good alternative to the solar power refrigerated camels and and of course there's no use in storage if you can't use and so there is this other unique material trait that that these materials have in that they're programmable EDA gradable and so and so what you see there is the difference in the top is you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade

and I'd never seen niobium until recently and then I was lent a medal I haven't won the Medal but it is a medal that is given each year to somebody who's made a real contribution to the field of niobium chemistry or niobium science the medal is made out of niobium so look carefully this is metallic niobium I can't remember it who won it last year but it has been won by a series of people mostly in the field of metalogy and I'll explain you why it's metalogy rather than chemistry in a minute so who gave you that one Professor I was lent this by the um company cbmm which Awards this medal uh together with the Institute of materials and minerals it is named after Charles Hatchet who was the English scientist who discovered niobium or C the element initially and it's really quite interesting it was at the beginning of the 19th century just after the idea of elements had been published so everybody was looking for elements and Charles Hatchet looked at a mineral which had been in a museum in London for quite a long time a mineral that came from America and he discovered a new element and because it came from America he called it columbium because Colombia isn't the Latin name that is often used for America and I think the name columbium sounds really beautiful you're normally really opposed to naming elements after countries well I think it's quite nice when it's named by somebody who doesn't come from that country then it's a genuine honor rather than a patriotic gesture and of course England had just lost the American colonies so it was particularly um nice gesture Hatchet unfortunately didn't continue as a chemist and he worked in a company that made carriages I suppose the modern equivalent of a sports car company and later in his career he focused on the carriages rather than on the science the element was then rediscovered in Germany and named niobium there was a problem because the Americans called it columbium the Europeans called it niobium and there was a sort of tradeoff it was agreed the Americans would call it niobium if the Germans and the Europeans would call Wolfram tungsten so everybody was happy but niobium is actually a relatively abundant element compared to many of the metals and the by far the biggest deposit is in Brazil where this company CB B mm is a mining company that digs niobium out of the ground now the main use for niobium at the moment is in strengthening steel steel for making Bridges steel for making cars steel for making pipelines that you use for High Press gas like natural gas so imagine this piece of paper is steel if the steel was just a single Crystal if you put a force on it like my pulling here it would be very strong but actually the steel consists of small So-Cal grains rather like small crystals the boundary between the grains is a weak point so let me illustrate that by tearing the paper a bit now you can see if I pull again when there's this weak point it just pulls apart very easily so the grain boundaries is what causes the failure and the pipe bursts if you don't make it thick enough if you add just a tiny bit of niobium to the steel less than 0.1 of a percent less than one part in a thousand the niobium concentrates along the grain boundary and strengthens it let me show you an analogy again so here we've got our two grains and you can see this weak point in between but now if you imagine the niobium across this grain boundary it forms a block so that when you pull it it's much stronger and it doesn't break I'm pulling really hard what this means is that if you add a small amount of niobium to your pipe to the steel that you make your pipe you can put a lot more gas through the same pipe there's a pipe in China which is 8,000 km long and by adding some myobium and making the pipe a little heavier one and A4 times heavier you can take two and a half times as much gas down the same pipe in cars the cars in developed countries like the US and in Europe they add about 200 g of niobium to the steel that makes up the car and that saves 100 kilos of weight of Steel in that car it's almost the weight of a whole passenger and so then when you're driving every 100 kilomet or so that you drive that saves one or two liters of petrol depending how aggressively you drive Professor how does adding niobium make the car lighter well it makes the car lighter because the SE steel is stronger so you don't need so much steel to make the same strength car but you said the pipe was made heavier in China that's cuz the other things were well you made it heavier by a little bit and then you could take twice as much gas in it in the car you just want to take the same number of passengers so you can make it lighter and take the same number of passengers it's quite difficult to put just a small amount of niobium into um the steel it's rather like adding just a grain or two of salt to your cooking so in fact the producers of niobium produce a material which is called ferroniobium which is a mixture of iron and niobium of which I've got some pieces here it it looks a bit black if you crack it open and so this is the material that is added to the mix when people are making steel well I believe that some met ologists In America still call it columbium and I think that's rather nice but it's not used as the name in chemistry and in fact I think most chemists will no longer have even know the name existed I like it it rolls off the tongue so much nicer than some of the modern names for elements that recently discovered ones but it's also good because it reminds one of the history and I think the discovery of niobium or columbium in a sample in a museum is a very good reason why we need to preserve things in museums because very often scientists who come later can discover things that the people who originally collected the samples would never have dreamt of the person who originally collected the sample where niobian was discovered didn't know that elements existed so there was the sample just waiting for the future scientist to discover this all right yeah so the other application for niobium is an alloy with tin which makes so-called superconducting wire some wires when you cool it down to very low temperature lose all their electrical resistance so you can put through a very big current without it heating up because the heat generated by an electric current is related to the resistance if the resistance is zero no heating this means that you can make very small and very powerful magnets such are used for magnetic resonance imaging and for some sorts of accelerators like the large hyron collider at CERN niobium again has a really quite important metallurgical role I'm not a physicist I'm not sure exactly why it is that niobium tin has these um superconducting properties but they only happen at very low temperature so you need liquid helium to cool them right down before you see this Behavior"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The name of this element caused a disagreement between America and Europe.

{"page": 54, "lesson": 8, "title": "Ruthenium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/tQjzNGRd", "transcript": {"en": "So this is a sample of ruthenium sponge. So\nthe ruthenium metal has been precipitated to form\nvery fine particles. So here we will just open the box I am rather ashamed that I made a big mistake\nabout the name of ruthenium. I thought it referred\nto somewhere in middle Europe perhaps in Czechoslovakia\nwhereas ruthenium actually comes from Ruthenia which\nis the Latin translation for the country that is now called\nRussia and, in fact, the element Ruthenium was first\ndiscovered in Russia in the city of Kazan. Why would that be a particular cause of shame\nfor you? Well, because my father was born in Russia\nand therefore to get something connected to Russia\nwrong is a bit embarrassing. The ruthenium is a very, very reactive metal\nespecially when it is formed in this very fine sponge\ntype material. Ruthenium was actually discovered relatively\nearly in the middle of the 19th century. There is some\ndiscussion, whether in fact the Swedish chemist Berzelius\nanalysed something that contained ruthenium and missed\nit or not, but I am not quite sure about that. But\nthe reason why I am interested in this is because I did\nmy doctorate with a supervisor and if you look\nat his supervisor and then that Ö then go back one\nsupervisor after another you eventually get to the Swedish\nchemist Berzelius who was my great, great, great,\ngreat, great, great, great supervisor and you will find\nthat most of the chemists now working in the world were related\nto just a few pioneering chemists in the 18th century. So the ruthenium is very finely divided and\nif I tip it you can see in the bottom of the vial very fine\npowders but again because of the particle size this is\nreally dark, very black, very nice sample of ruthenium\nvery useful for catalytic chemistry. It is as a catalyst that ruthenium is particularly\nfamous. Ruthenium itself if you look at a lump of\nthe metal is a kind of silvery colour. This is a sample of\nruthenium as a catalyst. Now because it is an expensive metal\nthe ruthenium is just distributed as a very thin\nlayer on silica. Silica is like sand and you can see\nthat this finely divided ruthenium looks black. They are very\nfinely divided so it has a large surface area so\nthe molecules can come in and react it. And my students\nwere using this catalyst to react an organic compound,\nthat is one with carbon and hydrogen and to get it to\nreact with more hydrogen and so they lent me this catalyst\nso I could show it to you. There are other ruthenium\ncatalysts which dissolve in the solution that you are\ntrying to get the reaction to go. And there is a very\nfamous catalyst named after the American chemist Bob\nGrubbs, who won the Nobel prize about 4 years ago,\nand his catalyst does a reaction which most people even\nsome chemists had not heard of called which is called\nmetathesis in which double bonds between two carbon\natoms are broken and joined together in a different way.\nAnd you can use this for all sorts of things you can make\nplastics out of oils; you can make new sorts of wax; you\ncan make a really great sort of wax that has oxygen\natoms in it; and if you use this for candles then the\noxygen atoms make fragrance molecules dissolve much\nbetter than in ordinary wax. So you can have a\nChristmas candle which, when you light it, smells of\nChristmas pudding or smells of alcohol or vanilla or\nwhatever spice you want. You canít do that with an\nordinary wax but this ruthenium catalyst opens up all\nsorts of things so that is why he got the Nobel Prize. He got the Nobel Prize because he made nice\nsmelling candles? No, he got the Nobel Prize because he invented\nthe catalyst that opened up all sorts of reactions\nthat otherwise could not be done. Bob Grubbs compound\nhas ruthenium and his is the most widely used\nand it is now used in a whole series of industrial processes.\nThis is another compound of ruthenium which you can\nsee is a rather nice red colour and it has the rather\nunromantic name of ruthenium Bpy three times or chemists\nwho use it call it RuBpy. And the point about this\ncompound is that it absorbs light well and it is very\nstable, you can shine light on it, very intense light for\na long time and the compound does not decompose, it does not\nchange. But what it can do when you shine light is\nthat you can move electrons around inside the compound\nand this compound and ones like it are being used by\npeople to try and capture the light from the sun - capture\nsolar energy"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The professor tells us that in his research family tree, we can find a very important 18th through 19th century chemist.

It arrived\njust a couple of days ago, from Alpha the company, so there is one gram of Rubidium,\nit costs about £65. It is one of the alkali metals, so it is very, very reactive, a bit\nlike sodium but perhaps a little bit more. So the metal itself is quite low melting,\nit won’t melt in my hand though unfortunately, so I am not going to show you it liquid now,\nbut you can see there is one gram of the metal inside this glass ampoule. It’s very reactive,\nand we are going to explore its chemistry now by putting this into some water. Well\nwe’ve got this really neat device which Neil put together last Friday and you can\nsee it’s got a hammer which is going to break the glass. Show us Neil, what does it do mate? So when the hammer falls, literally, we will\nbreak the glass, the rubidium will just drop into the big bucket of water that we’ve\ngot underneath. Rubidium is an alkali metal that comes between\npotassium and caesium and both potassium and caesium are much better known among chemists\nthan rubidium. Potassium because it is all over the world, the environment, you have\npotassium in cells and plants and so on, I mean biological cells. Rubidium on the other\nhand is quite rare. So I am going to give the sample now to Neil\nand Neil is going to load it and we are going to drop the hammer on it. There you go Neil. It was discovered originally by the German\nchemist Bunsen or ‘Bunsen’ as he was called, the one who invented the Bunsen burner and\nhe discovered it by looking at the colours that you see in flames, when he was heating\nup water that came from, mineral water that came from springs somewhere in Germany I believe,\nor it may have been somewhere in middle Europe. So Neil is arranging the sample of Rubidium\nagainst the metallic back plate in the small metallic collider. Rubidium gives a characteristic colour that\nis different from lilac of sodium or, I’m sorry, lilac of potassium or the orange of\nsodium. The rubidium is slightly more reactive than\nsodium so when we did the sodium experiments, we had our safety glasses and coat on, but\nfor rubidium we are going to wear secondary goggles, so here’s my safety goggles, which\nI am going to put on top. Don’t we look good. Nowadays, one of the main uses of rubidium,\nis actually in physics rather than in chemistry because you can heat up rubidium metal to\na high temperature and get a vapour of rubidium atoms in a specially constructed heated cell\nand you can get very interesting effects from shining very intense laser light into rubidium\natoms, and the rubidium atoms can do a whole series of different, very elegant physics\nexperiments. So rubidium has got a life of its own in physics but in chemistry, it’s\nperhaps slightly neglected. Was that it? Don’t think I needed my safety screen. Well that wasn't very exciting was it? There still could be some in there. It's all gone. You were right it was just a fizzle."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Rubidium is very similar to another alkali metal.

Bromine\ncomes from the Greek word bromos which means stench, a really horrible\nsmell. In fact this bromine probably comes from near\nwhere I did my degree because in Europe, the second, well the largest\nproducer of bromine in Europe is the Octale Company which is based\non Amlwch on Anglesey which is where I went last weekend.

So you can make bromine just by bubbling\nchlorine into a solution of bromide like Dead Sea water and\nthe chlorine displaces the bromine and forms chloride and the bromine\njust comes out as red fumes which you can catch. So Neil’s now using a glass knife to open\nthe ampoule and he’s going to pour the liquid bromine into this small evaporating\ndish inside our fume hood. Now instantly you can see the vapour\nof the bromine coming off. You see all those really nice orange fumes\nwhich are coming off from the liquid and then they’re being drawn away\nby our fume hood. Bromine has a number of uses, it is particularly\nused in plastics as an additive to try and make them less flammable.\nIf you’re watching your videos on a screen which has a plastic surround\nalmost certainly that surround will contain bromine to make it less\nflammable. Bromine itself is strongly oxidising so we\nthought we’d do an oxidation reaction today. And that reaction is to take\nanother element and here we have aluminium, simple aluminium foil, like\nyou wrap your dinner in, and we’re now going to put some small amounts\nof aluminium foil into the bromine liquid. So we put it in and it generally\ntakes a few moments for this reaction to start but as I said, the\naluminium is strongly oxidising. It oxidises and generates aluminium tribromide.\nWhich is a beautiful nice material but it’s a strongly exothermic\nreaction. So let’s see what happens. This may initiate. It is also an unusual element because elements\nhave different isotopes these are the same form of the element but\nwith different numbers of neutrons in the atoms so they weigh different\namounts. Usually you get one isotope that is very common and another\none that is only a small amount. Bromine is unusual because it has\ntwo isotopes 79 and 81 which have almost equal quantities in nature so\nthat they have approximately 51% of one and 49% of the other which is really\nquite unusual. So here we see the exothermic oxidation and\nformation of aluminium tribromide.\nSo the reaction is strongly exothermic which means it gives\nout energy and that energy then evaporates off excess bromine which\nyou can see coming off as a vapour. A wonderful exothermic reaction:\nvery, very fast, very, very rapid forming aluminium tribromide. Bromine is quite dangerous but it is less\ndangerous than chlorine because it’s a liquid at room temperature. Chlorine\nis a gas so if you let out chlorine it disperses everywhere. With bromine\nit is a heavy gas which can disperse rather more slowly. So now as the reaction cools down we can see\nthat the volume of bromine is significantly reduced. Reacts with water quite well."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Bromine is found in seawater as bromide, but where in the world can you find very concentrated solutions of bromide?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In the Mediterranean Sea"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the North Sea"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In the Dead Sea"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Bromine is a liquid at room temperature.

And how do you soothe the burn? Why does wasabi make your eyes water? And how spicy is the spiciest spice? Let's back up a bit. First, what is spiciness? Even though we often say that something tastes spicy, it's not actually a taste, like sweet or salty or sour. Instead, what's really happening is that certain compounds in spicy foods activate the type of sensory neurons called polymodal nociceptors. You have these all over your body, including your mouth and nose, and they're the same receptors that are activated by extreme heat. So, when you eat a chili pepper, your mouth feels like it's burning because your brain actually thinks it's burning. The opposite happens when you eat something with menthol in it. The cool, minty compound is activating your cold receptors. When these heat-sensitive receptors are activated, your body thinks it's in contact with a dangerous heat source and reacts accordingly. This is why you start to sweat, and your heart starts beating faster. The peppers have elicited the same fight-or-flight response with which your body reacts to most threats. But you may have noticed that not all spicy foods are spicy in the same way. And the difference lies in the types of compounds involved. The capsaicin and piperine, found in black pepper and chili peppers, are made up of larger, heavier molecules called alkylamides, and those mostly stay in your mouth. Mustard, horseradish, and wasabi are made up of smaller molecules, called isothiocyanates, that easily float up into your sinuses. This is why chili peppers burn your mouth, and wasabi burns your nose. The standard measure of a food's spiciness is its rating on the Scoville scale, which measures how much its capsaicin content can be diluted before the heat is no longer detectable to humans. A sweet bell pepper gets 0 Scoville heat units, while Tabasco sauce clocks in between 1,200-2,400 units. The race to create the hottest pepper is a constant battle, but two peppers generally come out on top: The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion and the Carolina Reaper. These peppers measure between 1.5 and 2 million Scoville heat units, which is about half the units found in pepper spray. So, why would anyone want to eat something that causes such high levels of pain? Nobody really knows when or why humans started eating hot peppers. Archaeologists have found spices like mustard along with human artifacts dating as far back as 23,000 years ago. But they don't know whether the spices were used for food or medication or just decoration. More recently, a 6,000 year old crockpot, lined with charred fish and meat, also contained mustard. One theory says that humans starting adding spices to food to kill off bacteria. And some studies show that spice developed mostly in warmer climates where microbes also happen to be more prevalent. But why we continue to subject ourselves to spicy food today is still a bit of a mystery. For some people, eating spicy food is like riding rollercoasters; they enjoy the ensuing thrill, even if the immediate sensation is unpleasant. Some studies have even shown that those who like to eat hot stuff are more likely to enjoy other adrenaline-rich activities, like gambling. The taste for spicy food may even be genetic. And if you're thinking about training a bit, to up your tolerance for spice, know this: According to some studies, the pain doesn't get any better. You just get tougher. In fact, researchers have found that people who like to eat spicy foods don't rate the burn any less painful than those who don't. They just seem to like the pain more. So, torment your heat receptors all you want, but remember, when it comes to spicy food, you're going to get burned."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are the receptors in your mouth that sense spicy compounds called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hotticus maximus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Polymodal nociceptors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Capsaicin reactors"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Taste buds"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What does your brain think when you’re eating a hot pepper?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "That your body is being burned by fire"}, {"label": "B", "text": "That your body is being sliced open"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That you are holding your breath"}, {"label": "D", "text": "That you’re drowning"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What’s the difference between chilies and wasabi?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The spices in chilies are made of smaller molecules that go up into the nose"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nothing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chilies are spicy and wasabi is sour"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The spices in wasabi is made up smaller molecules that go up into the nose"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which one of these is not a use for spice plants?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decoration"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Food"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Medicine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Insulation"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 54, "lesson": 17, "title": "Is there a difference between art and craft? - Laura Morelli", "category": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/is-there-a-difference-between-art-and-craft-laura-morelli", "transcript": {"en": "When you hear the word art, what comes to mind? A painting, like the Mona Lisa, or a famous sculpture or a building? What about a vase or a quilt or a violin? Are those things art, too, or are they craft? And what's the difference anyway? It turns out that the answer is not so simple. A spoon or a saddle may be finely wrought, while a monument may be, well, uninspired. Just as not every musical instrument is utilitarian, not every painting or statue is made for its own sake. But if it's so tricky to separate art from craft, then why do we distinguish objects in this way? You could say it's the result of a dramatic historical turn of events. It might seem obvious to us today to view people, such as da Vinci or Michelangelo, as legendary artists, and, of course, they possessed extraordinary talents, but they also happened to live in the right place at the right time, because shortly before their lifetimes the concept of artists hardly existed. If you had chanced to step into a medieval European workshop, you would have witnessed a similar scene, no matter whether the place belonged to a stonemason, a goldsmith, a hatmaker, or a fresco painter. The master, following a strict set of guild statutes, insured that apprentices and journeymen worked their way up the ranks over many years of practice and well-defined stages of accomplishment, passing established traditions to the next generation. Patrons regarded these makers collectively rather than individually, and their works from Murano glass goblets, to Flemish lace, were valued as symbols of social status, not only for their beauty, but their adherence to a particular tradition. And the customer who commissioned and paid for the work, whether it was a fine chair, a stone sculpture, a gold necklace, or an entire building, was more likely to get credit than those who designed or constructed it. It wasn't until around 1400 that people began to draw a line between art and craft. In Florence, Italy, a new cultural ideal that would later be called Renaissance Humanism was beginning to take form. Florentine intellectuals began to spread the idea of reformulating classical Greek and Roman works, while placing greater value on individual creativity than collective production. A few brave painters, who for many centuries, had been paid by the square foot, successfully petitioned their patrons to pay them on the basis of merit instead. Within a single generation, people's attitudes about objects and their makers would shift dramatically, such that in 1550, Giorgio Vasari, not incidentally a friend of Michelangelo, published an influential book called, \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects,\" elevating these types of creators to rock star status by sharing juicy biographical details. In the mind of the public, painting, sculpture and architecture were now considered art, and their makers creative masterminds: artists. Meanwhile, those who maintained guild traditions and faithfully produced candelsticks, ceramic vessels, gold jewelery or wrought iron gates, would be known communally as artisans, and their works considered minor or decorative arts, connoting an inferior status and solidifying the distinction between art and craft that still persists in the Western world. So, if we consider a painting by Rembrandt or Picasso art, then where does that leave an African mask? A Chinese porclein vase? A Navajo rug? It turns out that in the history of art, the value placed on innovation is the exception rather than the rule. In many cultures of the world, the distinction between art and craft has never existed. In fact, some works that might be considered craft, a Peruvian rug, a Ming Dynasty vase, a totem pole, are considered the cultures' preeminent visual forms. When art historians of the 19th Century saw that the art of some non-Western cultures did not change for thousands of years, they classified the works as primitive, suggesting that their makers were incapable of innovating and therefore were not really artists. What they didn't realize was that these makers were not seeking to innovate at all. The value of their works lay precisely in preserving visual traditions, rather than in changing them. In the last few decades, works such as quilts, ceramics and wood carvings have become more prominently included in art history textbooks and displayed in museums alongside paintings and sculpture. So maybe it's time to dispense with vague terms like art and craft in favor of a word like visual arts that encompasses a wider array of aesthetic production. After all, if our appreciation of objects and their makers is so conditioned by our culture and history, then art and its definition are truly in the eye of the beholder."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Before the Renaissance, there was no concept of ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Artisan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Artist"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The value of objects"}, {"label": "D", "text": "How to make a marble sculpture"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Prior to the Renaissance, painters were paid on the basis of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Their fame"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Their talent"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The square footage of their paintings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Recommendations from friends"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who authored a book in 1550 entitled Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, which rocketed several Renaissance artists to fame?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Giorgio Vasari"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Michelangelo Buonnaroti"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Leonardo da Vinci"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pablo Picasso"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Many cultures of the world, especially non-Western cultures, place a high value on __________ visual traditions.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Changing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Destroying"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Preserving"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Negating"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When art historians of the nineteenth century saw that the art of some non-Western cultures did not change for thousands of years, they classified the works as ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Progressive"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ugly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Primitive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Highly valuable"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

For instance, you probably know\nwhat this is and what this is, you probably don’t know what that is. Google it. Mr. Green Mr. Green why do you think people\nknow so little about Islamic history? Did you just ask an interesting non-annoying\nquestion, me from the past? I think we don’t know about early Islamic history because we\ndon’t learn about it, me from the past, because we don’t learn about it, because\nwe’re taught that our history is the story of Christianity in Europe, when in fact our\nhistory is the story of people on the planet, so let’s try to learn something today. [theme music] So in less than 200 years Islam went from\nnot existing to being the religious and political organizing principal of one of the largest\nempires in the world. And that story begins in the 7th century CE\nwhen the angel Gabriel appeared to Muhammad, a 40-ish guy who made his living as a caravan\ntrader and told him to begin reciting the word of God. Initially, this freaked Muhammad out, as,\nyou know, it would—but then his wife and a couple of other people encouraged him and\nslowly he came to accept the mantle as prophet. A few things to know about the world Islam\nentered: First, Muhammad’s society was intensely tribal. He was a member of the Quraysh tribe,\nliving in Mecca and tribal ties were extremely important. Also, at the time, the Arabian peninsula was\nlike this crazy religious melting pot. Like most tribal Arabs worshipped gods very similar to the\nMesopotamian gods you’ll remember from episode 3. And by the time of Muhammad, cult statutes\nof many of those gods had been collected in his hometown of Mecca in this temple-like\nstructure called the Kaaba. But Arabia was also a home for monotheisms\nlike Christianity and Judaism, even a bit of Zoroastrianism. So the message that there\nwas only god wouldn’t have been like as surprising to Muhammad as it was, for instance,\nto Abraham. Also, and this will become very important,\nthe northern part of Arabia was sandwiched between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian\nSassanian Empire—and you’ll remember, those guys were always fighting. They were\nlike snowboarders and skiers, or like the Westboro Baptist Church and everyone else. At its core, Islam is what we call a radical\nreforming religion—just like Jesus and Moses sought to restore Abrahamic monotheism after\nwhat they perceived as straying, so too did Muhammad. Muslims believe that God sent Muhammad as\nthe final prophet to bring people back to the one true religion, which involves the worship of,\nand submission to, a single and all-powerful God. The Quran also acknowledges Abraham and Moses\nand Jesus among others as prophets, but it’s very different from the Hebrew and Christian\nbibles: For one thing it’s much less narrative,\nbut also its the written record of the revelations Muhammad\nreceived—which means its not written from the point of view of people, it is seen as\nthe actual word of God. The Quran is a really broad-ranging text,\nbut it returns again and again to a couple themes. One is strict monotheism and the other\nis the importance of taking care of those less fortunate than you. The Quran, says of\nthe good person spends his substance—however much he himself\nmay cherish it—upon his near of kin, and the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer,\nand the beggars, and for the freeing of human beings from bondage. These revelations also radically increased\nthe rights of women and orphans, which was one of the reasons why Mohammad’s tribal\nleaders weren’t that psyched about them. To talk more about Islamic faith and practice,\nlet’s go to the Thought Bubble. The five pillars of Islam are the basic acts\nconsidered obligatory, at least by Sunni Muslims. First is the shahada or the profession of\nthe faith: There is no god but god and Muhammad is God’s\nprophet, which is sometimes translated as “There is no god but Allah and Muhammad\nis Allah’s prophet”, which tries to make Muslims sound other and ignores the fact that\nthe Arabic word for god—whether you are Christian or Jewish or Muslim—is Allah. Second, salat, or ritual prayer five times\na day—at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, and late evening—which are obligatory unless\nyou haven’t hit puberty, are too sick, or are menstruating. Keep it PG, Thought Bubble. Third, sawm, the month-long fast during the\nmonth of Ramadan, in which Muslims do not eat or drink or smoke cigarettes during daylight\nhours. Since Ramadan is a lunar-calendar month, it\nmoves around the seasons, and obviously it’s most fun during the winter, when days are\nshorter, and least fun during the summer, when days are both long and hot. Fourth is zakat, or almsgiving, in which non-poor\nMuslims are required to give a percentage of their income to the poor, and lastly hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that\nMuslims must try to fulfill at least once in their lives, provided they are healthy\nand have enough money. And there’s also more to understanding Islam\nthan just knowing the Quran. Like Judaism with its Talmud, and Christianity with its\nlives of saints and writings of Church fathers, Islam has supplementary sacred texts, chief\namong which is the hadith, a collection of sayings and stories about the Prophet. Thanks Thought Bubble. Oh, it’s time for\nthe open letter? Magic. An Open Letter to the 72 Virgins. Oh, but\nfirst let’s check what’s in the Secret Compartment. Huh, it’s Andre the Giant.\nDid you know that Andre the Giant died a virgin- is a fact that I made up? Dear 72 Virgins, Hey there, it’s me, John Green. Did you\nknow that not all hadiths were created equal? Some sayings of the Prophet are really well\nsourced. like for instance, a good friend or a relative heard the Prophet say something\nand then it ended up as a hadith. But some hadiths are terribly sourced like,\nnot to be irreverent, but some of it is like middle school gossip; like Rachel told Rebekah\nthat her sister’s brother’s friend kissed Justin Bieber on the face. And the vast majority of Muslims don’t treat\nterribly sourced hadiths as scripture. And the idea that you go to heaven and get\n72 virgins is not in the Quran; it’s in a terribly sourced hadith so it is my great\nregret to inform you, 72 Virgins, that in the eyes of almost all Muslims you do not\nexist. Best wishes,\nJohn Green One more thing about Islam: Like Christianity\nand Judaism, it has a body of law. You might have heard of it - it’s called sharia. Although we tend to think of sharia as this\nsingle set of laws that all Muslims follow, that’s ridiculous; there are numerous competing\ninterpretations of sharia, just as there are within any legal tradition. So people who embraced this worldview were\ncalled Muslims, because they submitted to the will of God, and they became part of the\numma, or community of believers. This would be a good moment for an Uma Thurman\njoke, but sadly she is no longer famous. I’m sorry if you’re watching this, Uma Thurman. Being part of the umma trumped all other ties,\nincluding tribal ties, which got Muhammad into some trouble and brings us, at last,\nback to history. So as Muhammad’s following in Mecca grew,\nthe umma aroused the suspicion of the most powerful tribe, the Quraysh. And it didn’t matter that Muhammad himself\nwas born into the Quraysh tribe because he wouldn’t shut up about how there was only\none God, which was really bad news to the Quraysh tribe because they managed the pilgrimage\ntrade in Mecca, and if all those gods were false, it would be a disaster economically. —although come to think of it, in the end the\nMeccan pilgrimage business turned out just fine. So the Quraysh forced Muhammad and his followers\nout of Mecca in 622 CE, and they headed to Yithrab, also known as Medina. This journey, also know as the hijra, is so\nimportant that it marks year 0 in the Islamic calendar. In Medina, Muhammad severed the religion’s\nties to Judaism, turning the focus of prayer away from Jerusalem to Mecca. Also in Medina, the Islamic community started\nto look a lot more like a small empire than like a church. Like, Jesus never had a country\nto run. But Muhammad did almost from the beginning.\nAnd in addition to being an important prophet, he was a good general and in 630, the Islamic\ncommunity took back Mecca. They destroyed the idols in the kabaa, and\nsoon Islam was as powerful a political force in the region as it was a religious one. And it’s because the political and religious\ncoexisted from the beginning, that there’s no separate tradition of civic and religious\nlaw like there is in Christianity and Judaism. very different from Judaism and even from\nChristianity—which you’ll remember debated very different from Judaism and even from\nChristianity—which you’ll remember debated for generations whether to be inclusive. —and more importantly than separating Islam\nfrom other monotheisms, that really separated Islam from the tribalism in Arabia. So then when Muhammad died in 632 CE, there\nwasn’t a religious vacuum left behind: Muhammad was the final prophet, the revelation of the Quran would\ncontinue to guide the umma throughout their lives. But the community did need a political leader,\na caliph. And the first caliph was Abu Bakr, Muhammad’s father-in-law, who was not without\nhis opponents: Many people wanted Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law,\nto lead the community. And although he did become the fourth caliph, that initial disagreement — to\nradically oversimplify because we only have ten minutes — began the divide between the\ntwo of the major sects of Islam: Suuni and Shi’a. And even today, Sunnis Muslims believe Abu\nBakr was rightly elected the first caliph and Shi’a Muslims believe it should’ve\nbeen Ali. To Sunnis, the first four caliphs—Abu Bakr,\nUmar, Uthman, and Ali— are known as the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and many of the conservative\nmovements in the Islamic world today are all about trying to restore the Islamic world\nto those glory days, which—like most glory days—were not unambiguously glorious. Abu Bakr stabilized the community after Muhammad’s\ndeath, and began the process of recording the Quran in writing, And started the military campaigns against\nthe Byzantine and Sassanian Empires that within 116 years would allow the Islamic Empire to\ngo from this to this. His successor Umar was both an uncommonly\ngood general and a brilliant administrator but like so many other great men, he proved\nterrible at avoiding assassination. Which led to the caliphate of Uthman, who\nstandardized the Quran and continued both his predecessor’s tradition of conquest\nand his predecessor’s tradition of getting assassinated. Then Ali finally got his turn at caliph, but\nhis ascension was very controversial, and it ultimately led to a civil war. Which eventually led to the emergence of Uthman’s\ntribe, the Umayyads, as the dynasty ruling over an ever-expanding Islamic Empire for\nmore than a hundred years. It’s common to hear that in these early\nyears Islam quote spread by the sword, and that’s partly true, unless you are — wait\nfor it — the Mongols. Actually, as usual, the truth is more complicated:Many\npeople, including the Mongols but also including lots of people in Central and East Asia, embraced\nIslam without any military campaigns. And in fact, the Quran says that religion\nmust not be an act of compulsion, but this much is true: The early Islamic empire was\nreally good at winning wars. And situated as they were between two very\nwealthy empires—the Byzantines and the Sassanians—there was plenty to fight for. First to fall was the Sassanians, the last\nnon-Muslim successor to the Persian Empire. They were relatively easy pickings because\nthey’d been fighting the Byzantines for like 300 years and were super tired. Also\nthey’d been recently struck by plague. Plague, man, I’m telling you; It’s like\nthe red tortoise shell of history. But in those early days they did pry away\nsome valuable territory like Egypt and the holy land and eventually they got into Spain. Where various Muslim dynasties would entrench\nthemselves until being expelled in 1492. But as a good as they were at making war,\nit’s still tempting to chalk up the Arabs’ success to, you know, the will of God. And certainly a lot of the people they conquered\nfelt that way. Wars in this part of the world didn’t just pit people against each other,\nthey also pitted their gods against each other. So while the Islamic Empire didn’t require\nits subjects to convert to Islam, their stunning successes certainly convinced a lot of people\nthat this monotheism thing was legit. Once again, John Green proving super hip to\nthe slang of today’s young’ns. Also, you paid lower taxes if you converted,\nand just as taxes on cigarettes lead to people not wanting to smoke, taxes on worshiping your idols\nlead to people not wanting to worship them anymore. So in a period of time that was, historically\nspeaking, both remarkably recent and remarkably short, a small group of people from an area\nof the world with no natural resources managed to create one of the great empires of the\nworld and also one of its great religions. And that very fact may be why people of\nWestern European descent remain largely ignorant about this period. Not only were the Muslims great conquerors,\nthey spawned an explosion of trade and learning that lasted hundreds of years. They saved many of the classical texts that\nform the basis of the “Western Canon” while Europe was ignoring them and they paved\nthe way for the Renaissance. While it’s important to remember that much\nof the world between Spain and the Indus River wasn’t Arabized, most of it was so thoroughly\nIslamized that these days we can’t think of the world we now call the Middle East without\nthinking of it as Islamic. Perhaps the greatest testimony to Islam’s\npower to organize peoples lives and their communities is that, in Egypt, 5 times a day millions of\npeople turn away from the Pyramids and toward Mecca. Egypt, birthplace to one of the longest continuous\ncultures the world has ever known, is now the largest Arab country in the world.

Zoom out, and you'll see the larger picture: our Earth, covered by 71 percent water, moving in one enormous current around the planet. This intimidating global conveyor belt has many complicated drivers, but behind it all is a simple pump that moves water all over the earth. The process is called thermohaline circulation, and it's driven by a basic concept: the concentration gradient. Let's leave the ocean for one moment and imagine we're in an empty room with lots of Roombas sardined together in one corner. Turn them all on at once and the machines glide outwards bumping into and away from each other until the room is filled with an evenly spaced distribution. The machines have moved randomly towards equilibrium, a place where the concentration of a substance is equally spread out. That's what happens along a concentration gradient, as substances shift passively from a high, or squashed, concentration, to a lower, more comfortable one. How does this relate to ocean currents and thermohaline circulation? Thermo means temperature, and haline means salt because in the real world scenario of the sea, temperature and salinity drive the shift from high to low concentrations. Let's put you back in the ocean to see how this works. Snap! You're transformed into a molecule of surface water, off the temperate coast of New York surrounded by a zillion rowdy others. Here, the sun's rays act as an energizer that set you and the other water molecules jostling about, bouncing off each other like the Roombas did. The more you spread out, the less concentrated the water molecules at the surface become. Through this passive motion, you move from a high to a lower concentration. Let's suspend the laws of physics for a moment, and pretend that your molecular self can plunge deep down into the water column. In these colder depths, the comparative lack of solar warmth makes water molecules sluggish, meaning they can sit quite still at high concentrations. No jostling here. But seeking relief from the cramped conditions they're in, they soon start moving upwards towards the roomier situation at the surface. This is how temperature drives a shift of water molecules from high to low concentrations, towards equilibrium. But sea water is made up of more than just H2O. There are a great deal of salt ions in it as well. And like you, these guys have a similar desire for spacious real estate. As the sun warms the sea, some of your fellow water molecules evaporate from the surface, increasing the ration of salt to H2O. The crowded salt ions left behind notice that lower down, salt molecules seem to be enjoying more space. And so an invasion begins, as they too move downwards in the water column. In the polar regions, we see how this small local process effects global movement. In the arctic and antarctic, where ice slabs decorate the water's surface, there's little temperature difference between surface and deeper waters. It's all pretty cold. But salinity differs, and in this scenario, that's what triggers the action. Here, the sun's rays melt surface ice, depositing a new load of water molecules into the sea. That not only increases the proximity between you and other water molecules, leaving you vying for space again, but it also conversely dilutes the concentration of salt ions. So, down you go, riding along the concentration gradient towards more comfortable conditions. For salt ions, however, their lower concentration at the surface, acts like an advertisement to the clamoring masses of salt molecules below who begin their assent. In both temperate and polar regions, this passive motion along a concentration gradient, can get a current going. And that is the starting point of the global conveyor called thermohaline circulation. This is how a simple concept becomes the mechanism underlying one of the largest and most important systems on our planet. And if you look around, you'll see it happening everywhere. Turn on a light, and it's there. Concentration gradients govern the flow of electricity, allowing electrons squashed together in one space to travel to an area of lower concentration when a channel is opened, which you do by flipping a switch. Right now, in fact, there's some gradient action going on inside you as you breath air into your lungs letting the concentrated oxygen in that air move passively out of your lungs and into your blood stream. We know that the world is filled with complex physical problems, but sometimes the first step towards understanding them can be simple. So when you confront the magnitude of the ocean's currents, or have to figure out how electricity works, remember not to panic. Understanding can be as simple as flipping a switch."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In temperate regions, the ocean surface water is heated by the sun, causing some water molecules to evaporate.

{"page": 54, "lesson": 20, "title": "Gold - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/31qLBa18", "transcript": {"en": "okay so what we're going to do today is something quite different I've never done it before we're going to take uh Brady's cheap CIO watch looks like this we're going to try and make it gold my favorite element so what we have here is a contraption that Neil made for evaporating Metals so what we have is we have a chamber vacuum chamber and then we have in air two electrodes and then the Gold's going to get really hot gold is an element that has really excited people for thousands of years and one of the reasons is that it's one of the very few metals that you can find in nature as the metal in the countryside in the right place you can find lumps of gold and once or twice in human history people have found really large lumps of gold weighing a kilo or more the Gold's going to melt a very high temperature eventually the gold atoms are going to start to come off the gold hopefully we're going to get a nice gold coating on the watch it's going to look like a uh expensive watch gold is a very unreactive element it doesn't react easily with oxygen or most of the other elements and therefore it can exist in the environment under conditions where most other metals would combine with oxygen or some other element to form minerals so what we're going to do here is we're going to test the um whether or not the watch can withstand the uh vacuum um so we're going to put it into this chamber before we put it into the vacuum chamber over here because that one has a turbo pump on it if the watch does explode it might ruin the turbo so we're we're going to risk this one first gold is quite a large atom because it's down near the bottom of the periodic table and so it doesn't form very strong bonds and it is forming strong bonds that makes chemicals or makes elements reactive so we're applying the vacuum now to the watch it all seems okay at the minute doesn't seem to have uh exploded still working is withstanding a pressure of uh1 mbar metals look like metals that is they have the the characteristic Sheen shininess because of the electrons in the solid are so-called delocalized that is the electrons aren't attached to to one atom but are essentially shared by lots and lots of atoms and in order to get this effect you only need a very very thin layer a few atoms thick 10 20 atoms thick and it already looks shiny and you can hardly see through it so what I have here is uh a little piece of gold that we're going to put into the uh boat in the vacuum chamber and we're going to heat it up to over a th000 degrees try and get it to melt to to evaporate you don't take you don't need an awful lot of gold to um actually get a gold covering on the uh gold colored covering on your watch so actually it's going to be very thin covering of gold nanometer level thickness gold like other elements in chemistry goes through Fashions the famous chemist Michael Faraday in the 19th century discovered that you could form very small particles of gold in water to make a solution which was called a colloid where these tiny lamps are so small that they don't settle out so even after years the liquid is still colored and in the last few years the last 10 15 years people have suddenly discovered that gold can be used as a catalyst for quite a few different reactions some of them quite simple like carbon monoxide Co reacting with oxygen to make CO2 which is a reaction that sometimes quite difficult to catalyze and gold catalyzes it very well I put my little bit of gold into the uh onto the boat there retake just going to put my little bit of gold onto the uh boat here in the middle so this is a really high vacuum now I think we're uh almost ready to crank up the current between these two electrodes going to heat up that uh boolt in there where the gold is sitting on and we're going to uh evaporate the metal onto the uh watch temperature going up and up now we're slowly turning up so the gold is heating up can't see it melting quite yet we might need a little bit more heat it's very difficult to find out how much precious metal is mined because the people who do the mining keep very quiet about exactly how much they get out some of the elements like rodium are mined on a very small scale perhaps 20 tons a year of metal even though millions of tons of Rock come out platinum and padium are at least 10 times more than that 200 400 tons a year and gold is about another 10 times or so I think and in a platinum mine gold almost comes out as an impurity they mine the Gold even though they're looking for the Platinum but they get obviously quite a lot of profit from the gold okay so the gold has melted I can see it melting here in the boat gold is completely liquid now so what's happening now is the gold is boiling away on the hot surface the atoms are coming up here depositing on the uh walls of the chamber and the watch is in the way here so all of these gold atoms that evaporate from the boat hit the watch and hopefully deposit here give us a nice thin gold film on the outside of the watch I've had very little gold I don't have a wedding ring although as you've seen from our videos I am married because gold can react with Mercury and it goes silver then and it spoils the Rings though you can polish it off so I've never worn a ring and I don't have any gold jewelry at all so you probably can't see it very well on the screen but what's Happening Here is I can see the gold in the boat is boiling away vigorously we're getting evaporation here we could see I could see um hopefully you can see on screen there's gold depositing over the window here as it evaporates off the surface off the boat but there's a shadow here where gold hasn't hit the window because the watch is in the way and there's a couple of metal bars here of course in ancient times the Alchemists were searching for gold what they wanted to do was to try and convert cheap metals like lead I think the reason they chose lead was because lead is heavy and dense like gold they wanted to transform form these cheap Metals into um gold so they would become rich or even better so they could sell the process there was already the start of chemical engineering selling the process to Kings and Rich princes so the rich princes could make gold can you see the inside of the window okay so see we've got a nice gold film here on the inside of the window so we definitely got some gold evaporating the famous physicist Isaac Newton was very keen on Alchemy and although his work on gravitation mathematics was brilliant his work on Alchemy was rather more misguided okay so here comes the watch so let's see is the front of it got uh Gone gold it has and it's made a bit of a mess on the front of the watch and I think it got a bit Hot and It's seems to have melted the window on the front of your watch so we've got a gold film here on the outside of your watch but you can see there's gaps in the gold so you can see here there's a little silver band and that's where we clipped it onto the uh holder to keep it in place"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "As the professor explained, which subatomic particles are responsible for the characteristic shininess of

talking about platinum and platinum is used in things like jewelry but probably more importantly or certainly more importantly from the point of view of chemists is used as a catalyst that was a very good catalyst for a lot of reactions which means it speed up reactions Platinum is an enormous Li and reactive element doesn't react with air so if you have a lump of platinum it stays the same for years and years and years so what I have here is platinum gauze so it's a very fine platon gauze at the end of stainless steel wire and we're going to use this as a catalyst to decompose some methanol in France locked away in a safe there is the international kilogram a block of platinum which defines what we mean by kilogram and every few years they take it out and weigh it just to make sure that all the balances and everything else haven't gone out of calibration and you can do this because platinum doesn't react with the air doesn't react with water and so on but even so I think they keep it under an inert gas to be doubly sure Platinum is quite expensive this piece here is very thin actually it's actually very thin so there's not a hell of a lot of platinum in this I'm going to put this platinum and contact what method our vapor going to heat it up a little bit and it's going to drive the catalytic decomposition of the methanol producing formaldehyde hopefully that reaction is going to generate some heat and hopefully the Platinum is going to get hot enough that it's going to set the methanol vapor on fire I was once invited all there was a chance to go on to tour to go in down the Platinum mang but I decided not to go firstly because you had to get there at 7 o'clock in the morning which bit early for me and secondly because you had to strip naked at the end just to make sure you weren't stealing any of the platinum full body search why didn't you want to do it very well even professors are modest so here on the real you can see at the top end a really beautiful sample of research quality platinum platinum is a very very precious metal it's a very very high value not just for jewelry but also for the production of auto catalytic converters and other chemical processes so I'm going to heat up their platinum a little bit and then I'm going to pop it into the flask Platinum is also used very widely in catalytic reactions if you expose methanol methyl alcohol to platinum in the presence of air the Platinum gets hot because it catalyzes makes the reaction between methanol and oxygen go much faster so what happened was I heated up the Platinum a little bit put it in into the atmosphere above the methanol and the methanol molecules hit the Platinum surface and start to decompose the second reaction that happens is when it gets hot enough methanol vapor can actually start to combust can start to react with oxygen inside the flask that was the pop that we heard pop was the oxygen being used up really quickly inside the flask really quite wonderful sample really expensive as well as one gram left one gram of platinum it's used in so-called glow plug engines for model aircraft if you have a model aeroplane and you want a real engine the No then you don't have room for spark plugs and things like that that you would have in a proper internal combustion engine but if you use a small piece of platinum the heat of the reaction keeps it hot so that the fuel mixture will ignite just as if you had a proper spark plug and everything else catalysis by platinum take two so we're going to have another go at decomposing methanol by a platinum catalyst Platinum is very expensive and the reason is expensive is that it's only found in very small amounts in the ores a really good platinum all may give you seven grams per tonne of rock and so you need an awful lot of rock to get a substantial amount of platinum and you've got to remember it's a very dense element so seven grams wood Platinum is far fewer atoms than say seven grams of lithium so we have a warm Platinum above the methanol methanol molecules are coming up hitting the Platinum surface starting to glow platinum mines also produce other so-called noble metals so you get quite a lot of gold coming from the mine in fact much of their profit comes from the gold and you also get palladium and rhodium and osmium though those are usually less abundant than the platinum and one of the real worries is that if we invent these new technologies platinum fuel cells for cars whether there be enough platinum in the world to make as many cars as we want now it's still going and we have a platinum it's been minutes the Platinum still down and sort of methanol molecules of evaporating slowly from the top of the the the methanol so first I hit the platinum and a decomposing platinum is also used in electrochemistry there are lots of reactions where you use an electric current to split water to do other electrochemical reactions and if you want to have an electrode that is really inert people use platinum the glow is generated this this this reaction it's quite energetic and generate some heat so we're actually heating up the Platinum surface as it goes along it was discovered in some electrochemical experiment which involved bacteria that Platinum can stop bacteria growing and this led to the discovery of a anti-cancer drug pulses platon I better get a muggy so this model here is not very good one but will do for cisplatin so you imagine the platinum in the middle with four atoms around it in cisplatin it has two nitrogen atoms here two chlorine atoms there and if you want to see how cisplatin is made we go really good video of my colleague John Moses and his group making it on the top of Mount Snowdon the highest mountain in Wales but the way that this works is that the platinum we can react with DNA in cancer cells and one of these groups attacks one strand of DNA the other group the other strand of DNA so that DNA which allows cells to multiply by the two strands splitting cannot split because they're held together by the cisplatin and so it is quite an effective cancer drug it's been going for a squad for quite a few minutes now which is pretty cool so it's glowing away there as the decomposition happens so there there's catalysis of methanol decomposition by a by platinum"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What happens when you

{"page": 54, "lesson": 22, "title": "Gadolinium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/AwgoXtaF", "transcript": {"en": "Ok so gadolinium is smack-bang in the middle\nof the 4f series. It’s perhaps most famous for the fact that it’s\nused as a contrast reagent in MRI machines. So if you need a full body scan,\na doctor will come along an inject you with a solution which contains\na bit of gadolinium and what it basically does is that it changes the way\nthat molecules, water molecules react in your body when they are\nscanned and then you can see the contrast between healthy tissue and,\nperhaps, unhealthy tissue and then that aids the doctors in their assignment. The thing about the lanthanide series is that\nit’s probably the best example of a smooth contraction in size as\nyou move from the left-hand side to the right-hand side and you lose about\n25% of the radius of the atoms as you move from the left to the right\nand this is called the ‘lanthanide contraction.’ This is actually\nwhat’s responsible for 2nd and 3rd row transition metals having very similar\ntypes of chemistry by group even though actually they should be quite\ndifferent. The 3rd row should be much larger but, because of the ‘lanthanide\ncontraction’, that increase in size is counterbalanced so they\nactually end up being more- or-less the same size as their 2nd row counterparts. Even chemists sometimes wonder how people\ncan get excited about particular parts of chemistry, and the rare\nearth elements are elements which, those who are not working in the area\ndon’t always see why it can be very exciting. So when I was a student\nI saw an advertisement in the lab where I was working about a lecture about\nthe oxidation states of the rare earth elements, and the relative stability\nof two of the oxidation states by a chemist called David Johnson,\nwho in those days worked for the Open University.

When you use it in compounds and you dissolve it,\noften you get colourful blue solutions from it. Sometimes they are green\nas well, but often I have found that if concentration of the solution\nmakes a really big difference to the colour of these solutions so you may\nhave a compound which appears to be red but actually as you dilute\nit down eventually it ends up being blue, which is really pretty and sometimes\nif you cannula it from one flask to another and you can see through\nthe cannula you can see it change colour as it goes through the cannula\nand then drops into the next solution again. So neodymium is one of the rare earths and\nit has a number of quite important applications. One of my favourite\nis in lasers, it’s used for example in this laser pointer and if you point\nthe laser it makes this rather nice bright green colour. A little known use of neodymium is that the\nsize and strength of volcanic eruptions can actually be judged from the\ncomposition of neodymium isotopes which are present. The first laser pointers were red. They didn’t\nuse neodymium, and the green ones have become really quite fashionable\namong lecturers. So the way this works is that inside here there\nis a small crystal, of so-called neodymium YAG, is the sum of the neodymium\natoms that are isolated in the glass that contains yttrium and aluminium\ntogether to form so-called the g is for garnet, which describes the structure\nof the solid, and if you excite this the neodymium atoms can emit light\nin the infrared, like heat rays you can’t see them. And then further\nup here there is another crystal which turns this infrared light into\ngreen light so the green light comes out at the end. And also when neodymium is combined with iron\nand boron it can form a type of magnet which we call a ‘Permanent\nMagnet’ and it is extremely strong, one of the strongest that we actually\nknow of. In order to get this doubling from the infrared\nto the green to work, you need to have pulses of light. So green lasers,\nalthough to the eye, look as if they are continuous are actually very\nrapid pulses which are very intense which is why these pointers are quite\ndangerous if you point them in the wrong direction in a lecture.\nBecause I wave my hands so much, I never use these in lectures. But I\nknow that you the cameraman have also used… Hello. …used neodymium, because neodymium is element\nnumber 60 and the cameraman’s future mother-in-law was 60\na few days ago and so we provided a sample of neodymium, element 60,\nfor him to present to her as a birthday present.
