What makes it so difficult to cure\nis that it's not one illness, but a family of over 100 diseases\noccurring in different types of cells. And one type of cancer \nhas the unfortunate distinction of afflicting children \nmore than any other type. This is leukemia, a cancer that begins in stem cells\nfound in the bone marrow. A stem cell is a bit like an infant, undeveloped but possessing \ngreat potential. Many stem cells specialize\nand become cells of organs, like the liver, brain and heart. But in some tissues, they can continue to divide into new \nstem cells throughout development, and into adulthood in order to frequently\ngenerate new cells and keep up with the body's needs. One example is the bone marrow, where stem cells differentiate\ninto many types of blood cells. That includes red blood cells, which carry oxygen \nfrom the lungs to all tissues, platelets, which help stop bleeding\nby sticking to damaged blood vessels, and white blood cells, which patrol the body,\ndestroying potentially harmful invaders. Every once in a while, something goes wrong during \na stem cell's specialization process and harmful mutations \noccur in the cell's DNA. Cells with compromised DNA\nare supposed to self-destruct, but some damaged cells ignore this order, replicating uncontrollably,\neven as they lose their original function. These are what we know as cancer cells. It is not yet clear why leukemia\nis the most common childhood cancer, but one contributing factor may be that leukemias are often caused\nby just one or two DNA modifications, while most cancers require many of them, allowing leukemias to arise faster\nthan other types of cancer. Moreover, some DNA alterations\ncan occur in white blood cells during fetal development, further increasing the risk \nof early leukemia. But though it affects more children\nthan any other cancer, adults constitute the majority\nof leukemia patients overall. Once leukemia strikes, the damaged cells\nreproduce in the blood and the bone marrow until they take up \nall available space and resources. When the bone marrow \ncan no longer produce the required amount of functional cells, the blood becomes depleted. The lack of red blood cells means that muscles \ndon't get enough oxygen, the reduced number of platelets\nis not sufficient to repair wounds, and the dearth of functional white\nblood cells impairs the immune system, increasing the risk of infections. To restore the normal \nfunction of the blood, leukemic cells have to be eliminated. But because leukemias \nare not solid tumors, they can't be removed surgically. Instead, the cells are killed\ninside the body using various treatments that include chemotherapy, a combination of drugs that destroys\nquickly multiplying cells. Unfortunately, this has the side effect\nof killing healthy cells, such as those found in hair follicles\nor intestines. And in some cases, the dosage \nrequired is so high that it kills all cells \nin the bone marrow, including stem cells. When this happens, the body is no longer\nable to create new blood cells on its own. Fortunately, outside help can come\nin the form of stem cells from the bone marrow of a donor. Once transplanted into the patient, they rapidly repopulate \nthe bone marrow and the blood. However, bone marrow transplants\nare a complicated process requiring antigen compatibility\nbetween the donor and recipient to keep the transplanted cells from\nfrom attacking the patient's own cells as foreign bodies. Unlike with blood transplants, there are thousands of HLA types, and even siblings and close relatives\nmay not have compatible bone marrow. If this is the case, the search \nis expanded to a database containing the genetic makeup of millions\nof voluntary bone marrow donors. The more potential donors there are, the more patients lives can be saved\nthrough successful transplants. Leukemia may be a frightening disease,\nbut there is strength and hope in numbers."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where do blood cells come from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are inherited from parents"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They self-reproduce"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They originate from bone marrow stem cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are present in the food we eat"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the function of platelets?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fighting infections"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Repairing wounds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Carrying oxygen to tissues"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Killing tumor cell"}], "correct_option": null}, {"question": "Where do blood cells come from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are inherited from parents"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They self-reproduce"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They originate from bone marrow stem cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are present in the food we eat"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the function of platelets?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fighting infections"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Repairing wounds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Carrying oxygen to tissues"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Killing tumor cells"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Cells with heavily damaged DNA:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Are not supposed to self-destruct"}, {"label": "B", "text": "May become cancer cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Never replicate anymore"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Usually come from the bone marrow"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How does leukemia affect the body?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It makes the patient hyperactive and restless"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It kills the cells in the hair follicles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It increases the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It crowds the bone marrow and impairs its function"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Doctors can't use surgery to remove leukemia because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Leukemias are not sensitive to surgical therapy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Surgery would be too harmful for patients"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Leukemias are not solid tumors with a precise localization"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The tumor would grow back after surgery"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Trillions of them are flying \nthrough you right this second, but you can't feel them. These ghost particles are called neutrinos\nand if we can catch them, they can tell us about \nthe furthest reaches and most extreme environments \nof the universe. Neutrinos are elementary particles, meaning that they can't be subdivided\ninto other particles the way atoms can. Elementary particles are the smallest\nknown building blocks of everything in the universe, and the neutrino is one \nof the smallest of the small. A million times less massive \nthan an electron, neutrinos fly easily through matter,\nunaffected by magnetic fields. In fact, they hardly ever \ninteract with anything. That means that they can travel\nthrough the universe in a straight line for millions, or even billions, of years, safely carrying information \nabout where they came from. So where do they come from? Pretty much everywhere. They're produced in your body\nfrom the radioactive decay of potassium. Cosmic rays hitting atoms \nin the Earth's atmosphere create showers of them. They're produced by nuclear \nreactions inside the sun and by radioactive \ndecay inside the Earth. And we can generate them \nin nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. But the highest energy neutrinos\nare born far out in space in environments that \nwe know very little about. Something out there,\nmaybe supermassive black holes, or maybe some cosmic dynamo\nwe've yet to discover, accelerates cosmic rays to energies\nover a million times greater than anything human-built\naccelerators have achieved. These cosmic rays, \nmost of which are protons, interact violently with the matter\nand radiation around them, producing high-energy neutrinos, which propagate out \nlike cosmic breadcrumbs that can tell us about the locations and interiors of the universe's most\npowerful cosmic engines. That is, if we can catch them. Neutrinos' limited interactions\nwith other matter might make them great messengers, but it also makes them \nextremely hard to detect. One way to do so is to put a huge volume\nof pure transparent material in their path and wait for a neutrino to reveal itself by colliding with the nucleus of an atom. That's what's happening \nin Antarctica at IceCube, the world's largest neutrino telescope. It's set up within \na cubic kilometer of ice that has been purified by the pressure of thousands of years \nof accumulated ice and snow, to the point where it's one \nof the clearest solids on Earth. And even though it's shot through with\nboreholes holding over 5,000 detectors, most of the cosmic neutrinos racing\nthrough IceCube will never leave a trace. But about ten times a year, a single high-energy neutrino\ncollides with a molecule of ice, shooting off sparks of charged\nsubatomic particles that travel faster through the ice\nthan light does. In a similar way to how a jet\nthat exceeds the speed of sound produces a sonic boom, these superluminal charged particles\nleave behind a cone of blue light, kind of a photonic boom. This light spreads through IceCube, hitting some of its detectors\nlocated over a mile beneath the surface. Photomultiplier tubes amplify the signal, which contains information about \nthe charged particles' paths and energies. The data are beamed \nto astrophysicists around the world who look at the patterns of light for clues about the neutrinos \nthat produced them. These super energetic collisions\nare so rare that IceCube's scientists give each\nneutrino nicknames, like Big Bird and Dr. Strangepork. IceCube has already observed the highest energy \ncosmic neutrinos ever seen. The neutrinos it detects should finally\ntell us where cosmic rays come from and how they reached \nsuch extreme energies. Light, from infrared,\nto x-rays, to gamma rays, has given us increasingly energetic and continuously surprising \nviews of the universe. We are now at the dawn\nof the age of neutrino astronomy, and we have no idea \nwhat revelations IceCube and other neutrino telescopes may bring us about the universe's most violent,\nmost energetic phenomena."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is a neutrino?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A neutral elementary particle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "One of the particles that builds up atoms"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A type of light"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why do you think neutrinos are so hard to detect?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because they are tiny"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because there are only a few of them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because they hardly ever interact with anything"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because they are produced too far away"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why is IceCube at the South Pole?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because you need a cubic kilometer detector to detect even a few cosmic neutrinos"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because most cosmic neutrinos come from the Southern Hemisphere"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because the winter is long and dark at the South Pole"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many individual sensors or detectors does IceCube have?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Around 100"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Close to 2,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Over 5,000"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What can cosmic neutrinos tell us about the universe?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They can tell us exactly when the Big Bang happened."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They can tell us where cosmic rays come from."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They can tell us how the Milky Way was formed."}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

We made this kindergarten \nto be a circle. It's a kind of endless circulation\non top of the roof. If you are a parent, you know that kids love\nto keep making circles. This is how the rooftop looks. And why did we design this? The principal of this kindergarten said, \"No, I don't want a handrail.\" I said, \"It's impossible.\" But he insisted: \"How about having a net\nsticking out from the edge of the roof? So that it can catch\nthe children falling off?\" (Laughter) I said, \"It's impossible.\" And of course,\nthe government official said, \"Of course you have to have a handrail.\" But we could keep \nthat idea around the trees. There are three trees popping through. And we were allowed to call \nthis rope as a handrail. But of course, rope has nothing\nto do with them. They fall into the net. And you get more, and more, more. (Laughter) Sometimes 40 children \nare around a tree. The boy on the branch, he loves the tree\nso he is eating the tree. (Laughter) And at the time of an event, they sit on the edge. It looks so nice from underneath. Monkeys in the zoo. (Laughter) Feeding time. (Laughter) \n(Applause) And we made the roof as low as possible, because we wanted to see\nchildren on top of the roof, not only underneath the roof. And if the roof is too high,\nyou see only the ceiling. And the leg washing place --\nthere are many kinds of water taps. You see with the flexible tubes, you want to spray water\nto your friends, and the shower, and the one in front is quite normal. But if you look at this, the boy is not washing his boots, he's putting water into his boots. (Laughter) This kindergarten is completely\nopen, most of the year. And there is no boundary\nbetween inside and outside. So it means basically\nthis architecture is a roof. And also there is no boundary\nbetween classrooms. So there is no acoustic barrier at all. When you put many children in a quiet box, some of them get really nervous. But in this kindergarten, there is no reason they get nervous. Because there is no boundary. And the principal says if the boy in the corner\ndoesn't want to stay in the room, we let him go. He will come back eventually,\nbecause it's a circle, it comes back. (Laughter) But the point is,\nin that kind of occasion, usually children try to hide somewhere. But here, just they leave and come back. It's a natural process. And secondly, we consider\nnoise very important. You know that children\nsleep better in noise. They don't sleep in a quiet space. And in this kindergarten, these children show\namazing concentration in class. And you know, our kind grew up\nin the jungle with noise. They need noise. And you know, you can talk\nto your friends in a noisy bar. You are not supposed to be in silence. And you know, these days we are trying to make\neverything under control. You know, it's completely open. And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter. In summer you go swimming. The sand is 50 degrees. And also, you should know\nthat you are waterproof. You never melt in rain. So, children are supposed to be outside. So that is how we should treat them. This is how they divide classrooms. They are supposed to help teachers. They don't. (Laughter) I didn't put him in. A classroom. And a washbasin. They talk to each other around the well. And there are always \nsome trees in the classroom. A monkey trying to fish\nanother monkey from above. (Laughter) Monkeys. (Laughter) And each classroom has\nat least one skylight. And this is where Santa Claus\ncomes down at the time of Christmas. This is the annex building, right next to that\noval-shaped kindergarten. The building is only\nfive meters tall with seven floors. And of course,\nthe ceiling height is very low. So you have to consider safety. So, we put our children,\na daughter and a son. They tried to go in. He hit his head. He's okay. His skull is quite strong. He is resilient. It's my son. (Laughter) And he is trying to see\nif it is safe to jump off. And then we put other children. The traffic jam is awful\nin Tokyo, as you know. (Laughter) The driver in front,\nshe needs to learn how to drive. Now these days, kids need a small dosage of danger. And in this kind of occasion, they learn to help each other. This is society. This is the kind of\nopportunity we are losing these days. Now, this drawing is showing\nthe movement of a boy between 9:10 and 9:30. And the circumference\nof this building is 183 meters. So it's not exactly small at all. And this boy did 6,000 meters\nin the morning. But the surprise is yet to come. The children in this kindergarten\ndo 4,000 meters on average. And these children have\nthe highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. The principal says, \"I don't train them.\nWe leave them on top of the roof. Just like sheep.\" (Laughter) They keep running. (Laughter) My point is don't control them, don't protect them too much, and they need to tumble sometimes. They need to get some injury. And that makes them learn how to live in this world. I think architecture is capable\nof changing this world, and people's lives. And this is one of the attempts\nto change the lives of children.

That may sound like science fiction, but it's a potential reality\nscientists are investigating right now. Will our brains one day \nbe able to self-repair? It's well known that embryonic cells\nin our young developing brains produce new neurons, the microscopic units \nthat make up the brain's tissue. Those newly generated neurons migrate\nto various parts of the developing brain, making it self-organize \ninto different structures. But until recently, scientists thought cell production came to\nan abrupt halt soon after this initial growth, leading them to conclude \nthat neurological diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and damaging events, like strokes,\nare irreversible. But a series of recent discoveries has revealed that adult brains \nactually do continue to produce new cells in at least three specialized locations. This process, known as neurogenesis, involves dedicated brain cells,\ncalled neural stem cells and progenitor cells, which manufacture new neurons\nor replace the old ones. The three regions where neurogenesis\nhas been discovered are the dentate gyrus,\nassociated with learning and memory, the subventricular zone, which may\nsupply neurons to the olfactory bulb for communication \nbetween the nose and brain, and the striatum, \nwhich helps manage movement. Scientists don't yet have a good grasp\non exactly what role neurogenesis plays \nin any of these regions, or why they have this ability \nthat's absent from the rest of the brain, but the mere presence of a mechanism\nto grown new neurons in the adult brain opens up an amazing possibility. Could we harness that mechanism\nto get the brain to heal its scars similar to how new skin\ngrows to patch up a wound, or a broken bone \nstitches itself back together? So here's where we stand. Certain proteins and other small molecules\nthat mimick those proteins can be administered to the brain to make neural stem cells \nand progenitor cells produce more neurons \nin those three locations. This technique still needs improvement so that the cells \nreproduce more efficiently and more cells survive. But research shows that progenitor cells\nfrom these areas can actually migrate to places where\ninjury has occurred and give rise to new neurons there. And another promising possible approach is to transplant healthy \nhuman neural stem cells, which are cultured in a laboratory,\nto injured tissue, like we can do with skin. Scientists are currently experimenting to determine whether transplanted\ndonor cells can divide, differentiate and successfully give rise \nto new neurons in a damaged brain. They've also discovered that we might be able to teach\nother kinds of brain cells, such as astrocytes\nor oligodendrocytes to behave like neural stem cells\nand start generating neurons, too. So, a couple of decades from now\nwill our brains be able to self-repair? We can't say for sure, but that has become one of the major \ngoals of regenerative medicine. The human brain has 100 billion neurons and we're still figuring out the wiring\nbehind this huge biological motherboard.

Cauliflower", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/EvtImKgg", "transcript": {"en": "If you could choose one vegetable to serve a king, what would it be? The extravagant French king Louis XIV demanded that cauliflower be served at all his feasts. It had something to do with a girlfriend who liked cauliflower... but maybe he knew that this common member of the cabbage family has a positively royal pedigree - when it comes to health: one cup of cauliflower has more Vitamin C than an orange; it's high in fiber, which helps digestion; and it's packed with cancer fighting antioxidants. When we eat cauliflower, we're actually eating a flower! In fact, we're eating hundreds of immature flowers that are bonded together into little lumps called curds. China and India throw the most cauliflower, but in the US, it's California - and that's where we've come to find out: How Does It Grow? We're here in Watsonville, Santa Cruz, at Lakeside Organic Gardens - one of the country's largest family-owned organic farms. Lakeside grows many different crops, including five million heads of cauliflower each year. First, they prepare the earth with fertilizer. (Dick): In our business we have a saying: \"We farm the soil, and the soil grows the crop.\" Because lakeside grows their cauliflower organically, that means they don't use chemical sprays to kill the bugs that eat the cauliflower plant; instead, they release predators like ladybugs that like to eat the bad insects. (Dick): We grow plants that attract the good bugs. (Nicole): Is that like these white flowers that you see here? (Dick): Yeah, these are Sweet Alyssum. So you'll see them around the edge of our field. They also use a natural soap spray, since bugs breathe through their skin when the soap covers their body they suffocate. But there's another secret to growing cauliflower organically: penguin poop. Lakeside is the country's largest importer of Peruvian Guano - aka seabird excrement. Guano is used as a fertilizer and is super rich in nitrogen because of all the fish those seabirds eat. And nitrogen is key to plant growth - it's a main ingredient in chlorophyll - the substance that plants make to convert sunlight to energy. When the cauliflower is the size of a tennis ball, farmers take some of the biggest leaves, and tie them over the head. They do this for one reason only: we like our cauliflower white. If the head is exposed to the sun, it turns yellow and even though it tastes exactly the same, we won't buy it! (Dick): what we throw away in California for cosmetic reasons could end World Hunger... When the cauliflower is 6 to 8 inches in diameter, the harvest begins. Right in the field, the cauliflower is trimmed and wrapped. Before being shipped, it will be cooled down to preserve its freshness. If the cauliflower is harvested too late, the curds begin to pull apart within just two days - that's when you can really see how the cauliflower is just a big bouquet of flowers waiting to bloom. Cauliflower is delicious. Cut up and roasted in the oven at high heat - the natural sugars caramelize, it gets tender and sweet. But for the love of God, don't boil it - it'll turn to mush!

You can't unboil an egg. Well, it turns out you can, sort of. What thermal energy \ndoes to the eggs' molecules, mechanical energy can undo. Eggs are mostly made \nof water and proteins. The proteins start off \nfolded up into intricate shapes, held together by weak chemical bonds. Adding heat disrupts those bonds, allowing the proteins to unfold,\nuncoil, unwind and wiggle freely. This process is called denaturing. The newly liberated proteins \nbump up against their neighbors and start to form \nnew bonds with each other, more and more as the heat increases, until finally, they're so entangled\nthat they gel into a solid mass, a boiled egg. That entanglement might look \npermanent, but it's not. According to a chemical idea called the principle \nof microscopic reversibility, anything that happens, \nlike egg proteins seizing up, can theoretically unhappen\nif you retrace your steps. But adding more heat will tangle\nthe proteins further, and cooling them down\nwill only freeze them, so here's the trick: spin them around ridiculously fast. I'm not kidding. Here's how it works. First, scientists dissolve \nboiled egg whites in water with a chemical called urea, a small molecule that acts as a lubricant,\ncoating the proteins' long strands and making it easier for them \nto glide past each other. Then, they spin that solution \nin a glass tube at a breakneck 5000 rotations per minute, making the solution \nspread out into a thin film. Here's the key part. The solution nearest\nthe wall spins faster than the solution closer to the middle. That difference in velocity \ncreates sheer stresses that repeatedly stretch \nand contract the proteins until eventually they snap back\ninto their native shapes and stay there. By the time the centrifuge stops spinning, the egg white is back \nin its original unboiled state. This technique works \nwith all sorts of proteins. Bigger, messier proteins can be\nmore resistant to being pulled apart, so scientists attach \na plastic bead to one end that adds extra stress\nand encourages it to fold up first. This unboiling method won't work\nwith a whole egg in its shell since the solution has to spread\nthroughout a cylindrical chamber. But the applications go way beyond\nuncooking your breakfast, anyhow. Many pharmaceuticals consist of proteins\nthat are extremely expensive to produce, partly because they get stuck \nin tangled up aggregates, just like cooked egg whites and have to be untangled and refolded\nbefore they can do their jobs. This spinning technique has the potential to be an easier, cheaper \nand quicker method than other ways to refold proteins, so it may allow new drugs to be made\navailable to more people faster. And there's one more thing \nyou need to keep in mind before trying to uncook all of your food. Boiling an egg is actually\nan unusual cooking process because even though it changes the way\nproteins are shaped and bound together, it doesn't actually change \ntheir chemical identity. Most types of cooking are more like\nthe famous Maillard reaction, which makes chemical changes that turn sugars and proteins\ninto delicious caramel crunchiness and are a lot harder to undo. So you might be able to unboil your egg, but I'm sorry to say \nyou can't unfry it...yet."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When the egg goes from raw to boiled, the egg whites' proteins start _____ and end up _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Unfolded (denatured) / folded (native)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Folded / tangled (aggregated)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Unfolded / tangled"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Folded / unfolded"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When the egg goes from raw to boiled, the egg whites' proteins start _____ and end up _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Unfolded (denatured) / folded (native)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Folded / tangled (aggregated)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Unfolded / tangled"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Folded / unfolded"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A folded protein is held in place by _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Weak chemical bonds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Strong chemical bonds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Scaffolding molecules"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Magnetic interactions"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In the vortex fluid device, the solution closet to the walls of the tube:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spins at the same rate as the solution closer to the center"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Spins fastest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spins slowest"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Spins at a variable rate"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What type of energy is being used to refold the proteins?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Thermal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chemical"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mechanical"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nuclear"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What makes boiling special, compared to other cooking processes like grilling or frying?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It changes the molecules' chemical identity, but not their shape"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It changes the molecules' shape, but not their chemical identity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It changes both the molecules' shape AND their chemical identity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It changes neither the molecules' shape nor their chemical identity"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

That may not sound like much, but it adds up to millions of dollars\nin cold hard cash. Counterfeit money has the potential\nto cause all sorts of problems, from leaving you short $20\nto destabilizing national economies. But don't worry. You can help catch the counterfeits. All you need are some simple tools\nand a bit of chemistry. First up, the anti-counterfeit \ndetection pen. The pen looks like a highlighter and contains a solution \nof potassium iodide and elemental iodine. It reveals of the presence of starch, which is commonly used \nto strengthen regular printer paper, but won't be found in real money. That's because authentic bills\nare made of cotton and linen and are threaded with tiny \nred and blue fibers. That material is made by a single,\nhighly-guarded company called Crane and Company, which has been printing currency since Paul Revere asked them \nto help finance the Revolutionary War. The starch in many counterfeit bills,\non the other hand, is made of two molecules: amylopectin and amylose. It's amylose that gives the fake away. Its long chain of sugar molecules\nconnected by oxygen atoms forms a helical structure, like DNA. Iodide likes to squeeze inside this coil, forming a new compound\nthat leaves a dark mark on the paper. However, in the absence of starch,\nthere is no chemical reaction and the mark will look light yellow. So if the fake isn't printed \non starchy paper, iodine solutions can't help you. That's one of the reasons \nU.S. bills printed since 1996 have been chemically enhanced to include\nanother counterfeit countermeasure: a strip that fluoresces under UV light. That's the same kind of light\nused at black light parties and airport security lines. The polyester strip \nprinted with invisble ink is just one millimeter wide and is found in different positions\ndepending on a bill's value. If you hold your dollar \nup to natural light, you can see the amount \nand the word USA printed on the band. But under UV light, \nthese strips really shine. They contain molecules that can be excited\nby absorbing certain amounts of energy, specifically, that given off \nby common UV light sources. As these excited molecules return\nto their original states, they lose a bit of energy as heat\nand then radiate the rest as light. Energy is inversely related to wavelength, which means that the longer wavelengths\nhave lower energy. So the lower energy light \ngiven off by the strip means longer wavelengths\nthat fall in the visible range, and suddenly we can see that \nwhich had been invisible. And if a glowing strip doesn't show up\non a recent bill, you have a fake on your hands. For times when you're not dealing \nwith counterfeit masterminds, looking for simple visual cues will do. Make sure the portrait \nlooks lifelike and not flat, the seal has perfectly \neven sawtooth points, the inked border is unbroken, and the serial number has precisely \nequal spacing between each number. So the next time you come across \nsome dubious dough, have a closer look, pull out your iodine solution, or take it to a rave and you just might catch a counterfeit."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Authentic dollar bills made of cotton and _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Linen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Starch"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Amylose"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wool"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Counterfeit detection pens contain solutions of potassium iodide and _____?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Elemental bromine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elemental chlorine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Elemental iodine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Elemental fluorine"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The counterfeit detection pen detects a counterfeit by leaving a dark mark on a bill when a reaction occurs between _____ and _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Amylopectin and I3-"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Amylose and I3-"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Amylopectin and I2-"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Amylose and I2-"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Energy and wavelength are inversely related, which means that if energy increases then wavelength _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decreases"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increases"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stays the same"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Does not change"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Fluorescent ink absorbs ultraviolet light, loses some energy as heat then radiates _____ that appear in the visible light range.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Higher energy wavelengths"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Shorter wavelengths"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The same wavelengths"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Longer wavelengths"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

William's son was to be executed unless William could shoot \nan apple off his head. William succeeded, but let's imagine\ntwo variations on the tale. In the first variation, the lord hires a bandit to steal\nWilliam's trusty crossbow, so he is forced to borrow\nan inferior one from a peasant. However, the borrowed crossbow\nisn't adjusted perfectly, and William finds that his practice shots cluster in a tight spread \nbeneath the bullseye. Fortunately, he has time \nto correct for it before it's too late. Variation two: William begins to doubt his skills\nin the long hours before the challenge and his hand develops a tremor. His practice shots still cluster\naround the apple but in a random pattern. Occasionally, he hits the apple, but with the wobble,\nthere is no guarantee of a bullseye. He must settle his nervous hand and restore the certainty in his aim\nto save his son. At the heart of these variations\nare two terms often used interchangeably: accuracy and precision. The distinction between the two is actually critical \nfor many scientific endeavours. Accuracy involves how close you come\nto the correct result. Your accuracy improves with tools\nthat are calibrated correctly and that you're well-trained on. Precision, on the other hand, is how consistently you can get \nthat result using the same method. Your precision improves \nwith more finely incremented tools that require less estimation. The story of the stolen crossbow\nwas one of precision without accuracy. William got the same wrong result\neach time he fired. The variation with the shaky hand\nwas one of accuracy without precision. William's bolts clustered \naround the correct result, but without certainty of a bullseye\nfor any given shot. You can probably get away \nwith low accuracy or low precision in everyday tasks. But engineers and researchers\noften require accuracy on microscopic levels with \na high certainty of being right every time. Factories and labs increase precision through better equipment \nand more detailed procedures. These improvements can be expensive,\nso managers must decide what the acceptable uncertainty \nfor each project is. However, investments in precision can take us beyond \nwhat was previously possible, even as far as Mars. It may surprise you that NASA\ndoes not know exactly where their probes are going to touch down\non another planet. Predicting where they will land\nrequires extensive calculations fed by measurements \nthat don't always have a precise answer. How does the Martian atmosphere's density\nchange at different elevations? What angle will the probe\nhit the atmosphere at? What will be the speed \nof the probe upon entry? Computer simulators run thousands\nof different landing scenarios, mixing and matching values\nfor all of the variables. Weighing all the possibilities, the computer spits out \nthe potential area of impact in the form of a landing ellipse. In 1976, the landing ellipse\nfor the Mars Viking Lander was 62 x 174 miles,\nnearly the area of New Jersey. With such a limitation, NASA had to ignore many interesting\nbut risky landing areas. Since then, new information \nabout the Martian atmosphere, improved spacecraft technology, and more powerful computer simulations\nhave drastically reduced uncertainty. In 2012, the landing ellipse \nfor the Curiosity Lander was only 4 miles wide by 12 miles long, an area more than 200 times \nsmaller than Viking's. This allowed NASA to target \na specific spot in Gale Crater, a previously un-landable area \nof high scientific interest. While we ultimately strive for accuracy, precision reflects our certainty\nof reliably achieving it. With these two principles in mind, we can shoot for the stars and be confident \nof hitting them every time."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "You are measuring length with a meter stick.

Sure, it makes them easy to roll\nand slide into place in any alignment but there's another more compelling reason involving a peculiar geometric property\nof circles and other shapes. Imagine a square \nseparating two parallel lines. As it rotates, the lines first push apart,\nthen come back together. But try this with a circle and the lines stay \nexactly the same distance apart, the diameter of the circle. This makes the circle unlike the square, a mathematical shape \ncalled a curve of constant width. Another shape with this property\nis the Reuleaux triangle. To create one, \nstart with an equilateral triangle, then make one of the vertices the center\nof a circle that touches the other two. Draw two more circles in the same way,\ncentered on the other two vertices, and there it is, in the space \nwhere they all overlap. Because Reuleaux triangles can rotate\nbetween parallel lines without changing their distance, they can work as wheels,\nprovided a little creative engineering. And if you rotate one while rolling\nits midpoint in a nearly circular path, its perimeter traces out a square\nwith rounded corners, allowing triangular drill bits\nto carve out square holes. Any polygon with an odd number of sides can be used to generate \na curve of constant width using the same method we applied earlier, though there are many others\nthat aren't made in this way. For example, if you roll any \ncurve of constant width around another, you'll make a third one. This collection of pointy curves\nfascinates mathematicians. They've given us Barbier's theorem, which says that the perimeter \nof any curve of constant width, not just a circle,\nequals pi times the diameter. Another theorem tells us that if you had\na bunch of curves of constant width with the same width, they would all have the same perimeter, but the Reuleaux triangle \nwould have the smallest area. The circle, which is effectively \na Reuleaux polygon with an infinite number of sides,\nhas the largest. In three dimensions, we can make \nsurfaces of constant width, like the Reuleaux tetrahedron, formed by taking a tetrahedron, expanding a sphere from each vertex\nuntil it touches the opposite vertices, and throwing everything away\nexcept the region where they overlap. Surfaces of constant width maintain a constant distance \nbetween two parallel planes. So you could throw a bunch \nof Reuleaux tetrahedra on the floor, and slide a board across them\nas smoothly as if they were marbles. Now back to manhole covers. A square manhole cover's short edge could line up with the wider part \nof the hole and fall right in. But a curve of constant width\nwon't fall in any orientation.

You may be walking across a soft carpet\nand reaching for the door knob when suddenly...zap! To understand static electricity, we first need to know a bit\nabout the nature of matter. All matter is made up of atoms that consist of three \ntypes of smaller particles: negatively charged electrons, positively charged protons, and neutral neutrons. Normally, the electrons and protons\nin an atom balance out, which is why most matter you come across\nis electrically neutral. But electrons are tiny \nand almost insignificant in mass, and rubbing or friction can give\nloosely bound electrons enough energy to leave their atoms\nand attach to others, migrating between different surfaces. When this happens, the first object is left \nwith more protons than electrons and becomes positively charged, while the one with more electrons\naccumulates a negative charge. This situation is called\na charge imbalance, or net charge separation. But nature tends towards balance, so when one of these newly charged bodies\ncomes into contact with another material, the mobile electrons \nwill take the first chance they get to go where they're most needed, either jumping off the negatively\ncharged object, or jumping onto \nthe positively charged one in an attempt to restore \nthe neutral charge equilibrium. And this quick movement of electrons,\ncalled static discharge, is what we recognize as that sudden spark. This process doesn't happen \nwith just any objects. Otherwise you'd be getting \nzapped all the time. Conductors like metals and salt water tend to have loosely \nbound outer electrons, which can easily flow between molecules. On the other hand, insulators \nlike plastics, rubber and glass have tightly bound electrons\nthat won't readily jump to other atoms. Static build-up is most likely to occur when one of the materials involved\nis an insulator. When you walk across a rug, electrons from your body\nwill rub off onto it, while the rug's insulating wool\nwill resist losing its own electrons. Although your body and the rug\ntogether are still electrically neutral, there is now a charge polarization\nbetween the two. And when you reach to touch the door knob, zap! The metal door knob's loosely \nbound electrons hop to your hand to replace the electrons \nyour body has lost. When it happens in your bedroom,\nit's a minor nuisance. But in the great outdoors, static electricity can be a terrifying,\ndestructive force of nature. In certain conditions,\ncharge separation will occur in clouds. We don't know exactly how this happens. It may have to do with the circulation\nof water droplets and ice particles within them. Regardless, the charge \nimbalance is neutralized by being released towards another body, such as a building, the Earth, or another cloud in a giant spark\nthat we know as lightning.

The Greeks fought it by chewing\naromatic resins, while the Chinese resorted to egg shells. In the ancient Jewish Talmud, it's even considered \nlegal grounds for divorce. This horrible scourge is halitosis,\notherwise known as bad breath. But what causes it,\nand why is it so universally terrifying? Well, think of some of the worst\nodors you can imagine, like garbage, feces or rotting meat. All of these smells come from the activity\nof microorganisms, particularly bacteria, and, as disgusting as it may sound, similar bacteria live in the moisture-rich\nenvironment of your mouth. Don't panic. The presence of bacteria in your body\nis not only normal, it's actually vital \nfor all sorts of things, like digestion and disease prevention. But like all living things,\nbacteria need to eat. The bacteria in your mouth \nfeed off of mucus, food remnants, and dead tissue cells. In order to absorb nutrients\nthrough their cell membranes, they must break down the organic matter\ninto much smaller molecules. For example, they'll break proteins \ninto their component amino acids and then break those down even further\ninto various compounds. Some of the foul-smelling \nbyproducts of these reactions, such as hydrogen sulfide and cadaverine, escape into the air and waft their way \ntowards unsuspecting noses. Our sensitivity to these odors\nand interpretation of them as bad smells may be an evolutionary mechanism\nwarning us of rotten food and the presence of disease. Smell is one of our most intimate\nand primal senses, playing a huge role \nin our attraction to potential mates. In one poll, 59% of men and 70% of women said they wouldn't go on a date \nwith someone who has bad breath, which may be why Americans alone spend $1 billion a year \non various breath products. Fortunately, most bad breath \nis easily treated. The worst smelling byproducts come from\ngram-negative bacteria that live in the spaces \nbetween gums and teeth and on the back of the tongue. By brushing and flossing our teeth, using antibacterial mouthwash at bedtime, gently cleaning the back of the tongue\nwith a plastic scraper and even just eating a healthy breakfast, we can remove many of these bacteria\nand their food sources. In some cases, \nthese measures may not be enough due to dental problems, \nnasal conditions, or rarer ailments, such as liver disease \nand uncontrolled diabetes. Behaviors like smoking \nand excessive alcohol consumption also have a very recognizable odor. Regardless of cause, the bad smell almost \nalways originates in the mouth and not the stomach \nor elsewhere in the body. But one of the biggest challenges lies in actually determining \nhow our breath smells in the first place, and it's unclear why. It may be that \nwe're too acclimatized to the smell inside \nour own mouths to judge it. And methods like cupping your hands\nover your mouth, or licking and smelling your wrist\ndon't work perfectly either. One study showed \nthat even when people do this, they tend to rate the smell subjectively according to how bad \nthey thought it was going to be.

Geckos seem to defy gravity, scaling vertical surfaces and walking upside down\nwithout claws, adhesive glues or super-powered spiderwebs. Instead, they take advantage \nof a simple principle: that positive \nand negative charges attract. That attraction binds together \ncompounds, like table salt, which is made of positively\ncharged sodium ions stuck to negatively charged chloride ions. But a gecko's feet aren't charged and neither are the surfaces \nthey're walking on. So, what makes them stick? The answer lies in a clever combination\nof intermolecular forces and stuctural engineering. All the elements in the periodic table\nhave a different affinity for electrons. Elements like oxygen and fluorine\nreally, really want electrons, while elements like hydrogen and lithium\ndon't attract them as strongly. An atom's relative greed for electrons\nis called its electronegativity. Electrons are moving around all the time and can easily relocate\nto wherever they're wanted most. So when there are atoms with different\nelectronegativities in the same molecule, the molecules cloud of electrons gets pulled towards \nthe more electronegative atom. That creates a thin spot \nin the electron cloud where positive charge \nfrom the atomic nuclei shines through, as well as a negatively charged \nlump of electrons somewhere else. So the molecule itself isn't charged, but it does have positively \nand negatively charged patches. These patchy charges can attract\nneighboring molecules to each other. They'll line up so that \nthe positive spots on one are next to the negative \nspots on the other. There doesn't even have to be a strongly\nelectronegative atom to create these attractive forces. Electrons are always on the move, and sometimes they pile up \ntemporarily in one spot. That flicker of charge is enough\nto attract molecules to each other. Such interactions between \nuncharged molecules are called van der Waals forces. They're not as strong as the interactions\nbetween charged particles, but if you have enough of them,\nthey can really add up. That's the gecko's secret. Gecko toes are padded \nwith flexible ridges. Those ridges are covered \nin tiny hair-like structures, much thinner than human hair,\ncalled setae. And each of the setae is covered \nin even tinier bristles called spatulae. Their tiny spatula-like shape is perfect\nfor what the gecko needs them to do: stick and release on command. When the gecko unfurls its flexible toes\nonto the ceiling, the spatulae hit at the perfect angle\nfor the van der Waals force to engage. The spatulae flatten, creating lots of surface area \nfor their positively and negatively charged patches to find\ncomplimentary patches on the ceiling. Each spatula only contributes a minuscule\namount of that van der Waals stickiness. But a gecko has about two billion of them, creating enough combined force \nto support its weight. In fact, the whole gecko could dangle\nfrom a single one of its toes. That super stickiness \ncan be broken, though, by changing the angle just a little bit. So, the gecko can peel its foot back off, scurrying towards a meal\nor away from a predator. This strategy, using a forest \nof specially shaped bristles to maximize the van der Waals forces \nbetween ordinary molecules has inspired man-made materials designed to imitate \nthe gecko's amazing adhesive ability. Artificial versions aren't as strong\nas gecko toes quite yet, but they're good enough to allow \na full-grown man to climb 25 feet up a glass wall. In fact, our gecko's prey is also using\nvan der Waals forces to stick to the ceiling. So, the gecko peels up its toes\nand the chase is back on."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "An atom's electronegativity is its _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Van der Waals radius"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Affinity for electrons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Negative charge"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ability to attract water molecules"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which elements are highly electronegative?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oxygen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hydrogen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lithium"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fluorine"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A and D"}, {"label": "F", "text": "B and C"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "In a molecule where one atom is more electronegative than the other, the electrons will tend to be _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Evenly distributed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Farthest away from the more electronegative atom"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Closer to the more electronegative atom"}, {"label": "D", "text": "There's no way to know--they move randomly"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How do the setae and spatulae help the gecko stick?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Their shape increases the coefficient of friction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Their branched structure hooks onto the surface like Velcro"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They contain charged particles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They increase the surface area of the gecko's foot"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "A gecko can disengage its stickiness by _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stepping in water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Changing the angle of the spatulae"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Placing its foot on a conductive surface"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Secreting a slippery substance"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

And as a sister and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand,\nwhy is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true? What is it about my brother's brain\nand his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams\nto a common and shared reality, so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to research\ninto the severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state\nof Indiana to Boston, where I was working in the lab\nof Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab,\nwe were asking the question, \"What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals\nwho would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia,\nschizoaffective or bipolar disorder?\" So we were essentially\nmapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicating\nwith which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities\nof those chemicals? So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing\nthis type of research during the day, but then in the evenings\nand on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,\nthe National Alliance on Mental Illness. But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had\na brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded\nin the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read,\nwrite or recall any of my life. I essentially became\nan infant in a woman's body. If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres\nare completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you\na real human brain. (Groaning, laughter) So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain, the back of brain\nwith the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be\npositioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that\nthe two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions\nlike a parallel processor, while our left hemisphere functions\nlike a serial processor. The two hemispheres\ndo communicate with one another through the corpus callosum, which is made up of some\n300 million axonal fibers. But other than that, the two hemispheres\nare completely separate. Because they process\ninformation differently, each of our hemispheres\nthink about different things, they care about different things,\nand, dare I say, they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been. (Laughter) Our right human hemisphere\nis all about this present moment. It's all about \"right here, right now.\" Our right hemisphere,\nit thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically\nthrough the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy,\nstreams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes\ninto this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment\nsmells like and tastes like, what it feels like\nand what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected\nto the energy all around me through the consciousness\nof my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings\nconnected to one another through the consciousness\nof our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers\nand sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect,\nwe are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,\nis a very different place. Our left hemisphere\nthinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past\nand it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage\nof the present moment and start picking out details,\nand more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes\nall that information, associates it with everything\nin the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future\nall of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere\nthinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter\nthat connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, \"Hey, you've got to remember\nto pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning.\" It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me\nwhen I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important,\nit's that little voice that says to me, \"I am. I am.\" And as soon as my left hemisphere\nsays to me \"I am,\" I become separate. I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain\nthat I lost on the morning of my stroke. On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding\npain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain\nthat you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me\nto ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, \"OK, I'll just start\nmy normal routine.\" So I got up and I jumped\nonto my cardio glider, which is a full-body,\nfull-exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing, and I'm realizing that my hands\nlook like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, \"That's very peculiar.\" And I looked down at my body and I thought,\n\"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing.\" And it was as though my consciousness\nhad shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine\nhaving the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself\nhaving this experience. And it was all very peculiar,\nand my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine, and I'm walking\nacross my living room floor, and I realize that everything\ninside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid\nand very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction\nin my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear\nthe dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, \"OK.\nYou muscles, you've got to contract. You muscles, you relax.\" And then I lost my balance,\nand I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define\nthe boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin\nand where I end, because the atoms\nand the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms\nand molecules of the wall. And all I could detect\nwas this energy -- energy. And I'm asking myself,\n\"What is wrong with me? What is going on?\" And in that moment, my left hemisphere\nbrain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control\nand pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself\ninside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence\nof the energy around me. And because I could no longer\nidentify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with\nall the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden\nmy left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me,\n\"Hey! We've got a problem! We've got to get some help.\" And I'm going, \"Ahh! I've got a problem!\" (Laughter) So it's like, \"OK, I've got a problem.\" But then I immediately drifted\nright back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately\nrefer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be\ntotally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you\nto the external world. So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress\nrelated to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships\nin the external world and any stressors related\nto any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine\nwhat it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful. And again, my left hemisphere\ncomes online and it says, \"Hey! You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help.\" And I'm thinking, \"I've got to get help.\nI've got to focus.\" So I get out of the shower\nand I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking,\n\"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?\" And in that moment, my right arm went totally\nparalyzed by my side. Then I realized, \"Oh my gosh!\nI'm having a stroke!\" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool! (Laughter) This is so cool! How many brain scientists\nhave the opportunity to study their own brain\nfrom the inside out?\" (Laughter) And then it crosses my mind,\n\"But I'm a very busy woman!\" (Laughter) \"I don't have time for a stroke!\" So I'm like, \"OK, I can't stop\nthe stroke from happening, so I'll do this for a week or two,\nand then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help.\nI've got to call work.\" I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office\nI had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room, I pull\nout a three-inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly\nin my mind's eye what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this\nwas my card or not, because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words\nblended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,\nand I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait\nfor what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment, I would be able\nto reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card...\nthat's not the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch\ndown inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger\nin my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers,\nI do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad\nand I put it right here. I take the business card,\nI put it right here, and I'm matching the shape\nof the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles\non the phone pad. But then I would drift back out\ninto La La Land, and not remember when I came back\nif I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield\nmy paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers\nas I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back\nto normal reality, I'd be able to tell, \"Yes,\nI've already dialed that number.\" Eventually, the whole number gets dialed\nand I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone\nand he says to me, \"Woo woo woo woo.\" (Laughter) (Laughter) And I think to myself, \"Oh my gosh, he sounds\nlike a Golden Retriever!\" (Laughter) And so I say to him --\nclear in my mind, I say to him: \"This is Jill! I need help!\" And what comes out of my voice is,\n\"Woo woo woo woo woo.\" I'm thinking, \"Oh my gosh,\nI sound like a Golden Retriever.\" So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand\nlanguage until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help\nand he gets me help. And a little while later,\nI am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston\nto [Massachusetts] General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon\nwith the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift\nand just I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment, I knew that I was\nno longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body\nand give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps\nmy moment of transition. When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover\nthat I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender,\nI said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite\nplanes of reality. Stimulation coming in\nthrough my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out\nfrom the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position\nof my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated\nfrom her bottle. And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding\nthrough the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able\nto squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized, \"But I'm still alive! I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana\nand I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive\ncan find Nirvana.\" And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,\ncompassionate, loving people who knew that they could come\nto this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right\nof their left hemispheres -- and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift\nthis experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be\nto how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,\nthe surgeons went in, and they removed a blood clot\nthe size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama, who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years\nto completely recover. So who are we? We are the life-force power\nof the universe, with manual dexterity\nand two cognitive minds. And we have the power\nto choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness\nof my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful\nmolecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into\nthe consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become\na single individual, a solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the \"we\" inside of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep\ninner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project\ninto the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an idea\nworth spreading. Thank you.

out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in space I felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria nirvana I found nirvana I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body but then I realized but I'm still alive I'm still alive and I have found nirvana and and if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive then everyone who is alive can find nirvana and I pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time and that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace and then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be what what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives and it motivated me to recover two-and-a-half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers Here I am with my

As it turns out, it may \nhave been more like this. In the third century BC, Hieron,\nking of the Sicilian city of Syracuse, chose Archimedes to supervise an engineering project \nof unprecedented scale. Hieron commissioned a sailing vessel 50 times bigger than a standard\nancient warship, named the Syracusia after his city. Hieron wanted to construct\nthe largest ship ever, which was destined \nto be given as a present for Egypt's ruler, Ptolemy. But could a boat the size\nof a palace possibly float? In Archimedes's day, \nno one had attempted anything like this. It was like asking, \"Can a mountain fly?\" King Hieron had a lot \nriding on that question. Hundreds of workmen were to labor\nfor years on constructing the Syracusia out of beams of pine \nand fir from Mount Etna, ropes from hemp grown in Spain, and pitch from France. The top deck, on which \neight watchtowers were to stand, was to be supported not by columns, but by vast wooden images of Atlas\nholding the world on his shoulders. On the ship's bow, a massive catapult would be able \nto fire 180 pound stone missiles. For the enjoyment of its passengers, the ship was to feature \na flower-lined promenade, a sheltered swimming pool, and bathhouse with heated water, a library filled with books and statues, a temple to the goddess Aphrodite, and a gymnasium. And just to make things \nmore difficult for Archimedes, Hieron intended to pack \nthe vessel full of cargo: 400 tons of grain, 10,000 jars of pickled fish, 74 tons of drinking water, and 600 tons of wool. It would have carried well over\na thousand people on board, including 600 soldiers. And it housed 20 horses \nin separate stalls. To build something of this scale, only for that to sink \non its maiden voyage? Well, let's just say that failure wouldn't have been a pleasant \noption for Archimedes. So he took on the problem: will it sink? Perhaps he was sitting \nin the bathhouse one day, wondering how a heavy bathtub can float, when inspiration came to him. An object partially immersed in a fluid\nis buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid\ndisplaced by the object. In other words, if a 2,000 ton Syracusia\ndisplaced exactly 2,000 tons of water, it would just barely float. If it displaced 4,000 tons of water,\nit would float with no problem. Of course, if it only displaced \n1,000 tons of water, well, Hieron wouldn't be too happy. This is the law of buoyancy, and engineers still \ncall it Archimedes' Principle. It explains why a steel supertanker\ncan float as easily as a wooden rowboat or a bathtub. If the weight of water displaced\nby the vessel below the keel is equivalent to the vessel's weight, whatever is above the keel\nwill remain afloat above the waterline. This sounds a lot like another story\ninvolving Archimedes and a bathtub, and it's possible that's because\nthey're actually the same story, twisted by the vagaries of history. The classical story of Archimedes' Eureka!\nand subsequent streak through the streets centers around a crown, \nor corona in Latin. At the core of the Syracusia story\nis a keel, or korone in Greek. Could one have been \nmixed up for the other? We may never know. On the day the Syracusia arrived in Egypt\non its first and only voyage, we can only imagine how residents\nof Alexandria thronged the harbor to marvel at the arrival \nof this majestic, floating castle. This extraordinary vessel was the Titanic\nof the ancient world, except without the sinking,\nthanks to our pal, Archimedes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What Greek city did Archimedes come from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Athens"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Syracuse"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thebes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the name of the tyrant of Syracuse?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hieron"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dionysius"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Achilles"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was the name of the ship designed by Archimedes?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Titanic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Syracusia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Ark"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "To what goddess was the temple on Archimedes' ship dedicated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Aphrodite"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Athena"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hera"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was the principle Archimedes discovered?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Measurement of Volume"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Principle of Density"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Principle of Buoyancy"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Orenstein", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/learning-from-smallpox-how-to-eradicate-a-disease-julie-garon-and-walter-a-orenstein", "transcript": {"en": "For most of human history, medical workers sought \nto treat diseases or cure them. The rise of vaccination \nin the 19th century enhanced the potential to prevent people from contracting illnesses\nin the first place. But only in recent decades did it \nbecome possible to ensure that a particular disease\nnever threatens humanity again. The story of smallpox, the first and, so far, the only disease to be permanently \neradicated from the world, shows how disease eradication can happen\nand why it is so difficult to achieve. Smallpox emerged in human populations\nthousands of years ago as a contagious virus that spread rapidly, primarily through close, \nface to face contact, causing fever, aches and rashes. It killed up to 30% of its victims and often left survivors with life-long\ndisfiguring scars. The devastating impact \nof smallpox was so great that several cultures had religious \ndeities specifically dedicated to it. In the 20th century alone, it is estimated to have killed\nmore than 300 million people worldwide. With the effective \ndeployment of vaccination, the number of cases began to decrease. By seeking out infected individuals, isolating them, and vaccinating their contacts \nto prevent further transmission, scientists realized that the spread\nof the disease could be haulted. In fact, because smallpox could\nonly survive in human hosts, vaccinating all of an infected persons'\npotential contacts would stop the virus dead in its tracks and eliminate it from that region. Once this strategy had succeeded in ridding most industrialized countries\nfrom disease, health officials realized that eradicating\nit worldwide was within reach. But this was not an easy process, proving especially difficult in places\nsuffering from poor infrastructure or civil wars. The eradication effort took decades and involved millions \nof people working together, from world leaders\nand international organizations to rural doctors and community workers. In India, one of the last \nstrongholds of the disease, health workers visited every one\nof the country's 100 million households to search for cases. Through this unprecedented \nworldwide effort, in which even rival \nsuperpowers cooperated, smallpox was finally \ndeclared eradicated in 1980, saving approximately 40 million lives\nover the following two decades. There were several factors that made smallpox\nan ideal candidate for eradication. First, humans are essential\nto the smallpox lifecycle, so breaking the chain \nof human to human transmission causes the virus to die out. In contrast, many other pathogens,\nlike ebola or the bubonic plague, can survive in animal carriers, while the bacteria that cause tetanus\ncan even live in the soil. Secondly, individuals \ninfected with smallpox displayed a characteristic rash,\nmaking them easy to identify, even without a lab test. The lack of such practical \ndiagnostic tools for diseases with non-specific symptoms,\nor that have long incubation periods, such as AIDS,\nmakes their eradication more difficult. Third, the availability \nof a smallpox vaccine that provided immunity \nfor five to ten years in a single dose meant that there was \nan effective intervention to stop the virus from spreading. And finally, the initial success\nof several countries in eliminating the disease \nwithin their borders served as a proof of principle\nfor its eradication worldwide. Today, the same criteria \nare applied to determine whether other diseases \ncan be similarly eliminated. And even though smallpox remains\nthe only success story thus far, several other pathogens \nmay be next in line. Great progress has been made\ntowards eradicating guinea worm disease simply by use of water filters. And vaccination for polio, which previously disabled hundreds\nof thousands of people each year is estimated to have prevented 13 million\ncases of paralysis, and 650,000 deaths since 1988. With a 99% drop in infections\nsince the eradication effort began, one final push is all that is needed to ensure that polio \nwill never paralyze another child. Disease eradication is one public health\neffort that benefits all of humanity and challenges us to work together\nas a global community. Beyond eliminating specific diseases, eradication programs benefit \nlocal populations by improving health infrastructure. For example, Nigeria recently \nused facilities and personnel from their polio eradication program\nto effectively control an ebola outbreak. Further more, globalization \nand international travel means that even a single infection\nanywhere in the world can potentially spread to other regions. By helping to protect others,\nwe help to protect ourselves. Disease eradication is the ultimate gift\nwe can give to everyone alive today, as well as all future \ngenerations of humanity."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How does smallpox spread?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Food and water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Face-to-face contact"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fecal matter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Blood"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Smallpox is deadly in up to _____ percent of cases.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10"}, {"label": "B", "text": "30"}, {"label": "C", "text": "60"}, {"label": "D", "text": "90"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following diseases is impossible to eradicate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tetanus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Measles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dracunculiasis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Poliomyelitis"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Guinea worm disease is nearly eradicated thanks to which effective intervention", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A vaccine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mosquito nets"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Antiviral medication"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Water filters"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which characteristic made smallpox an ideal candidate for eradication?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An effective vaccine existed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Humans are an essential part of the smallpox virus lifecycle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cases displayed a characteristic rash"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Several countries successfully eliminated the disease"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

The answer is all of them. These are all parasites, organisms that live on \nor inside another host organism, which they harm and sometimes even kill. Parasite survival depends on transmitting\nfrom one host to the next, sometimes through \nan intermediate species. Our parasites elegantly achieve this\nby manipulating their host's behavior, sometimes through direct brain hijacking. For example, this is the Gordian worm. One of its hosts, this cricket. The Gordian worm needs water to mate,\nbut the cricket prefers dry land. So once it's big enough to reproduce, the worm produces proteins that garble\nthe cricket's navigational system. The confused cricket \njumps around erratically, moves closer to water, and eventually leaps in,\noften drowning in the process. The worm then wriggles out to mate and its eggs get eaten \nby little water insects that mature, colonize land, and are, in turn, eaten by new crickets. And thus, the Gordian worm lives on. And here's the rabies virus,\nanother mind-altering parasite. This virus infects mammals, often dogs, and travels up the animal's \nnerves to its brain where it causes inflammation \nthat eventually kills the host. But before it does, it often increases\nits host's aggressiveness and ramps up the production\nof rabies-transmitting saliva, while making it hard to swallow. These factors make the host \nmore likely to bite another animal and more likely to pass \nthe virus on when it does. And now, meet Ophiocordyceps,\nalso known as the zombie fungus. Its host of choice is tropical ants\nthat normally live in treetops. After Ophiocordyceps spores \npierce the ant's exoskeleton, they set off convulsions \nthat make the ant fall from the tree. The fungus changes the ant's behavior,\ncompelling it to wander mindlessly until it stumbles onto a plant leaf with\nthe perfect fungal breeding conditions, which it latches onto. The ant then dies, and the fungus parasitizes its body\nto build a tall, thin stalk from its neck. Within several weeks, \nthe stalk shoots off spores, which turn more ants \ninto six-legged leaf-seeking zombies. One of humanity's most deadly assailants\nis a behavior-altering parasite, though if it's any consolation, it's not our brains \nthat are being hijacked. I'm talking about Plasmodium,\nwhich causes malaria. This parasite needs mosquitoes\nto shuttle it between hosts, so it makes them bite more frequently\nand for longer. There's also evidence \nthat humans infected with malaria are more attractive to mosquitoes, which will bite them \nand transfer the parasite further. This multi-species system is so effective, that there are hundreds of millions\nof malaria cases every year. And finally, there are cats. Don't worry, there probably \naren't any cats living in your body and controlling your thoughts. I mean, probably. But there is a microorganism\ncalled Toxoplasma that needs both cats and rodents\nto complete its life cycle. When a rat gets infected\nby eating cat feces, the parasite changes chemical levels\nin the rat's brain, making it less cautious\naround the hungry felines, maybe even attracted to them. This makes them easy prey, so these infected rodents\nget eaten and pass the parasite on. Mind control successful. There's even evidence that the parasite\naffects human behavior. In most cases, \nwe don't completely understand how these parasites manage \ntheir feats of behavior modification. But from what we do know, we can tell that they have \na pretty diverse toolbox. Gordian worms seem to affect\ncrickets' brains directly. The malaria parasite, on the other hand, blocks an enzyme \nthat helps the mosquitoes feed, forcing them to bite over \nand over and over again. The rabies virus may cause \nthat snarling, slobbering behavior by putting the immune system\ninto overdrive. But whatever the method, when you think about how effectively these parasites control \nthe behavior of their hosts, you may wonder how much of human behavior\nis actually parasites doing the talking. Since more than half of the species\non Earth are parasites, it could be more than we think."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What do all parasites have in common?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All parasites are worms"}, {"label": "B", "text": "All parasites live in or on host organisms"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All parasites kill their hosts"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All parasites need mosquitoes to move from one host to the next"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What do Gordian worms do to their cricket hosts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They make crickets move erratically"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They make crickets move close to water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They make crickets jump in water"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Tsetse flies transmit the protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in humans.

Some need a stand or a stool. But the cajon is a drum, a stand\nand a seat all in one convenient box. And this simplicity may be key to its\njourney across continents and cultures to become one of the most popular \npercussion instruments in the world today. The cajon's story begins in West Africa, whose Indigenousness people\nhad rich musical traditions centered on drumming and dancing. When many of them were captured\nand brought to the Americas as slaves, they brought this culture with them, but without their native instruments,\nthey had to improvise. African slaves in coastal Peru\ndidn't have the materials or the opportunity to craft \none of their traditional drums such as a djembe or a djun djun. But what they did have \nwere plenty of shipping crates. Not only were these readily accessible, but their inconspicuous appearance may have helped get around laws \nprohibiting slaves from playing music. Early Peruvian cajons \nconsisted of a simple box with five thick wooden sides. The sixth side, made of \na thinner sheet of wood, would be used as the striking surface, or more commonly known as the tapa. A sound hole was also cut into the back\nto allow the sound to escape. As an Afro-Peruvian culture developed, and new forms of music and dance,\nsuch as Zamacueca, Festejo and Landó were born, the cajon became a dedicated musical\ninstrument in its own right. Early modifications involved simply\nbending the planks of the box to tweak the sound, and when abolition of slavery introduced\nthe cajon to a broader population, more improvisation \nand experimentation soon followed. Perhaps the person most responsible \nfor introducing the cajon to European audiences was Spanish \nFlamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía. When touring in Peru in 1977, he and his percussionist Rubem Dantas discovered the cajon \nand brought it back to Spain, recognizing its potential \nfor use in Flamenco music. By stretching guitar strings \nalong the inside of the tapa, the flamenco musicians were able to create\na buzz-like snare sound. Combined with the regular base tone, this gave the cajon a sound \nclose to a basic drum set. The cajon quickly caught on, not only becoming standard in Flamenco, but being used in genres like folk,\njazz, blues, and rock. Today, many specialized cajons \nare manufactured, some with adjustable strings, some with multiple playing surfaces, and some with a snare mechansim. But the basic concept remains the same, and the story of the cajon shows that the simplest things \ncan have the most amazing potential when you think outside and inside the box."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where does the cajon's story begin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Europe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "South East Asia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "West Africa"}, {"label": "D", "text": "South America"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What did the African Slave's have plenty of to use as drums?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shipping crates"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dunduns"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Guitars"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Seagulls"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the cajon's striking surface more commonly known as?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sound hole"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Snare"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Strings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tapa"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When the flamenco musicians gave the cajon a snare sound, what instrument did the cajon sound like?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Drum set"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Flute"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Harmonica"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Saxophone"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What South American culture are we talking about when we discuss the story of the cajon?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Inca"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Samba"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Afro-Peruvian"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Amazonian"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

One organism absorbed another, and they united to become a new organism\nwith the combined abilities of both. We think that around 2 billion years ago, the only living organisms on Earth\nwere prokaryotes, single-celled organisms \nlacking membrane-bound organelles. Let's look closely at just three of them. One was a big, simple blob-like cell with the ability to absorb things \nby wrapping its cell membrane around them. Another was a bacterial cell that converted solar energy into sugar\nmolecules through photosynthesis. A third used oxygen gas to break down\nmaterials like sugar and release its energy into a form useful\nfor life activities. The blob cells would occasionally absorb\nthe little photosynthetic bacteria. These bacteria then lived inside the blob\nand divided like they always had, but their existence became linked. If you stumbled upon \nthis living arrangement, you might just think that the whole thing\nwas one organism, that the green photosynthetic bacteria\nwere just a part of the blob that performed one of its life functions, just like your heart is a part of you that performs the function \nof pumping your blood. This process of cells living together\nis called endosymbiosis, one organism living inside another. But the endosymbiosis didn't stop there. What would happen\nif the other bacteria moved in, too? Now the cells of this species started\nbecoming highly complex. They were big and full \nof intricate structures that we call chloroplasts \nand mitochondria. These structures work together \nto harness sunlight, make sugar, and break down that sugar using the oxygen that right around this time started \nto appear in the Earth's atmosphere. Organisms absorbing other organisms was one way species adapted\nto the changing environmental conditions of their surroundings. This little story highlights what \nbiologists call the endosymbiotic theory, the current best explanation\nof how complex cells evolved. There's a lot of evidence \nthat supports this theory, but let's look at three main pieces. First, the chloroplasts and mitochondria\nin our cells multiply the very same way as those ancient bacteria, which are still around, by the way. In fact, if you destroy these structures\nin a cell, no new ones will appear. The cell can't make them. They can only make more of themselves. Second piece of evidence. Chloroplasts and mitochondria both contain\ntheir own DNA and ribosomes. Their DNA has a circular structure that is strikingly similar to the DNA\nof the ancient bacteria, and it also contains many similar genes. The ribosomes, or protein assembly \nmachines of chloroplasts and mitochondria, also have the same structure as ribosomes\nof ancient bacteria, but are different from the ribosomes hanging around\nthe rest of eukaryotic cell. Lastly, think about the membranes involved\nin the engulfing process. Chloroplasts and mitochondria\nboth have two membranes surrounding them, an inner and outer membrane. Their inner membrane contains \nsome particular lipids and proteins that are not present \nin the outer membrane. Why is that significant? Because their outer membrane\nused to belong to the blob cell. When they were engulfed\nin the endosymbiosis process, they got wrapped up in that membrane\nand kept their own as their inner one. Surely enough, those same lipids and proteins are found on the membranes\nof the ancient bacteria. Biologists now use this theory to explain the origin of the vast \nvariety of eukaryotic organisms. Take the green algae that grow on \nthe walls of swimming pools. A larger eukaryotic cell with spinning \ntail structures, or flagella, at some point absorbed algae like these\nto form what we now call euglena. Euglena can perform photosynthesis, break down sugar using oxygen, and swim around pond water. And as the theory would predict, the chloroplasts in these euglena\nhave three membranes since they had two before being engulfed. The absorbing process\nof endosymbiotic theory allowed organisms to combine \npowerful abilities to become better adapted to life on Earth. The results were species \ncapable of much more than when they were separate organisms, and this was an evolutionary leap that lead to the microorganisms, plants, and animals we observe \non the planet today."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Endosymbiosis can best be described as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Many cells of one type of organism living closely together"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Two organisms occupying the same type of environment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "One organism living completely inside another organism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "How a multicellular organism uses cell division to grow"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The endosymbiotic theory explains how organelles inside eukaryotic cells are descended from ancient _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Unicellular prokaryotic organisms"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Unicellular eukaryotic organisms"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Multicellular prokaryotic organisms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Multicellular eukaryotic organisms"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "New mitochondria inside eukaryotic cells are produced by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Expression of mitochondria genes in the DNA stored in the cell's nucleus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Constantly absorbing prokaryotic cells that break down sugar using oxygen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The dividing of mitochondria already present in the cell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The chloroplasts of the cell"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Chloroplasts in a eukaryotic cell have both an inner and outer membrane.

But of all the U.S. presidents accused\nof misusing that power, only one has left office as a result. Does Richard Nixon deserve\nto be remembered for more than the scandal\nthat ended his presidency? Find out as we put this disgraced\npresident's legacy on trial in History vs. Richard Nixon. \"Order, order. Now, who's the defendant today,\nsome kind of crook?\" \"Cough. No, your Honor. This is Richard Milhous Nixon,\nthe 37th president of the United States, who served from 1969 to 1974.\" \"Hold on. That's a weird number of years\nfor a president to serve.\" \"Well, you see, President Nixon\nresigned for the good of the nation and was pardoned by President Ford,\nwho took over after him.\" \"He resigned because he was about\nto be impeached, and he didn't want the full extent\nof his crimes exposed.\" \"And what were these crimes?\" \"Your Honor, the Watergate scandal\nwas one of the grossest abuses of presidential power in history. Nixon's men broke into the Democratic\nNational Committee headquarters to wiretap the offices\nand dig up dirt on opponents for the reelection campaign.\" \"Cough It was established that the President\ndid not order this burglary.\" \"But as soon as he learned of it,\nhe did everything to cover it up, while lying about it for months.\" \"Uh, yes, but it was for the good\nof the country. He did so much during his time in office\nand could have done so much more without a scandal jeopardizing\nhis accomplishments.\" \"Uh, accomplishments?\" \"Yes, your Honor. Did you know it was President Nixon who proposed the creation\nof the Environmental Protection Agency, and signed the National Environmental\nPolicy Act into law? Not to mention the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, expansion of the Clean Air Act.\" \"Sounds pretty progressive of him.\" \"Progressive? Hardly. Nixon's presidential campaign courted\nSouthern voters through fear and resentment\nof the civil rights movement.\" \"Speaking of civil rights, the prosecution may be surprised to learn\nthat he signed the Title IX amendment, banning gender-based discrimination\nin education, and ensured that desegregation of schools\noccurred peacefully, and he lowered the voting age to 18,\nso that students could vote.\" \"He didn't have much concern\nfor students after four were shot\nby the National Guard at Kent State. Instead, he called them bums\nfor protesting the Vietnam War, a war he had campaigned on ending.\" \"But he did end it.\" \"He ended it two years\nafter taking office. Meanwhile, his campaign had sabotaged\nthe previous president's peace talks, urging the South Vietnamese government\nto hold out for supposedly better terms, which, I might add, didn't materialize. So, he protracted the war for four years, in which 20,000 more U.S. troops,\nand over a million more Vietnamese, died for nothing.\" \"Hmm, a presidential candidate interfering\nin foreign negotiations -- isn't that treason?\" \"It is, your Honor, a clear violation\nof the Logan Act of 1799.\" \"Uh, I think we're forgetting\nPresident Nixon's many foreign policy achievements. It was he who normalized ties with China,\nforging economic ties that continue today.\" \"Are we so sure that's a good thing? And don't forget his support\nof the coup in Chile that replaced the democratically-elected\nPresident Allende with a brutal military dictator.\" \"It was part of the fight\nagainst communism.\" \"Weren't tyranny and violence the reasons\nwe opposed communism to begin with? Or was it just fear of the lower class\nrising up against the rich?\" \"President Nixon couldn't have predicted\nthe violence of Pinochet's regime, and being anti-communist didn't mean\nneglecting the poor. He proposed a guaranteed basic income\nfor all American families, still a radical concept today. And he even pushed for comprehensive\nhealthcare reform, just the kind that passed 40 years later.\" \"I'm still confused about\nthis burglary business. Was he a crook or not?\" \"Your Honor, President Nixon\nmay have violated a law or two, but what was the real harm compared\nto all he accomplished while in office?\" \"The harm was to democracy itself. The whole point of the ideals\nNixon claimed to promote abroad is that leaders are accountable\nto the people, and when they hold themselves\nabove the law for whatever reason, those ideals are undermined.\" \"And if you don't hold people accountable\nto the law, I'll be out of a job.\" Many politicians have compromised\nsome principles to achieve results, but law-breaking and cover-ups threaten\nthe very fabric the nation is built on.

Maranto", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-we-have-museums-j-v-maranto", "transcript": {"en": "Hello, everyone. \nLet's begin our guided tour. Welcome to the Museum of Museums. Museums have been a part of human history\nfor over 2000 years. But they weren't always \nlike the ones we visit today. The history of museums is far older\nand much stranger than you might imagine. We'll start over here in the Greek wing. Our word museum\ncomes from the Greek mouseion, temples built for the Muses,\nthe goddesses of the arts and the sciences. Supplicants asked the Muses \nto keep watch over academics and grant ingenuity \nto those they deemed worthy. The temples were filled \nwith offerings of sculptures, mosaics, complex scientific apparatuses, poetic and literary inscriptions, and any other tribute that would \ndemonstrate a mortal's worthiness for divine inspiration. We have arrived at the Mesopotamian wing. The first museum was created in 530 B.C.\nin what is now Iraq. And the first curator \nwas actually a princess. Ennigaldi-Nanna started to collect\nand house Mesopotamian antiquities in E-Gig-Par, her house. When archeologists excavated the area, they discovered dozens of artifacts\nneatly arranged in rows, with clay labels \nwritten in three languages. She must have had interesting parties. The tradition of collecting and displaying\nintriguing items began to be mimicked, as you can see here \nin the Roman Empire wing. Treasure houses \nof politicians and generals were filled with the spoils of war, and royal menageries \ndisplayed exotic animals to the public on special occasions,\nlike gladiator tournaments. As you can see, we have a lion here\nand a gladiator, and, well, the janitor ought \nto be in this wing clearly. Moving on, hurry along. The next step in the evolution of museums\noccurred in the Renaissance, when the study of the natural world\nwas once again encouraged after almost a millennium \nof Western ignorance. Curiosity cabinets,\nalso referred to as Wunderkammers, were collections of objects that acted\nas a kind of physical encyclopedia, showcasing artifacts. Just step into the wardrobe here.\nThere you go. Mind the coats. And we'll tour Ole Worm's cabinet, One of the most notable Wunderkammers belonged to a wealthy \n17th-century naturalist, antiquarian, and physician Ole Worm. Ole Worm collected natural specimens, human skeletons, ancient runic texts, and artifacts from the New World. In other curiosity cabinets, you could find genetic anomalies, precious stones, works of art, and religious and historic relics. Oh my. You might not want to touch that. These cabinets were private, again,\noften in residencies, curated by their owners, \nrulers and aristocrats, as well as merchants and early scientists. Now, who hears a circus organ? In the 1840s, an enterprising young showman\nnamed Phineas T. Barnum purchased some of the more famous\ncabinets of curiosity from Europe and started Barnum's American Museum\nin New York City. A spectacular hodgepodge of zoo, lecture hall, wax museum, theater, and freak show that was known\nfor its eclectic residents, such as bears, elephants, acrobats, giants, Siamese twins, a Fiji mermaid, and a bearded lady, along with a host of modern machinery\nand scientific instruments. Museums open to the public\nare a relatively new phenomenon. Before Barnum, the first public museums were only accessible \nby the upper and middle classes, and only on certain days. Visitors would have to apply \nto visit the museum in writing prior to admision, and only small groups could visit\nthe museum each day. The Louvre famously allowed all members\nof the public into the museum but only three days a week. In the 19th century, the museum as we know it\nbegan to take shape. Institutions like the Smithsonian\nwere started so that objects could be seen and studied,\nnot just locked away. American museums, in particular, commissioned experiments and hired explorers to seek out \nand retrieve natural samples. Museums became centers for scholarship\nand artistic and scientific discovery. This is often called the Museum Age. Nowadays, museums are open to everybody, are centers of learning and research, and are turning \ninto more hands-on institutions. But the question of who gets to go\nis still relevant as ticket prices can sometimes \nbar admission to those future scholars, artists\nand targets of divine inspiration who can't afford \nto satisfy their curiosity.

{"page": 46, "lesson": 24, "title": "Why are some people left-handed? - Daniel M. Abrams", "category": "Growth & Development", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-are-some-people-left-handed-daniel-m-abrams", "transcript": {"en": "If you know an older left-handed person, chances are they had to learn to write\nor eat with their right hand. And in many parts of the world, it's still common practice to force\nchildren to use their \"proper\" hand. Even the word for right\nalso means correct or good, not just in English,\nbut many other languages, too. But if being left-handed is so wrong, then why does it happen\nin the first place? Today, about 1/10 of the world's\npopulation are left-handed. Archeological evidence shows\nthat it's been that way for as long as 500,000 years, with about 10% of human remains showing the associated differences\nin arm length and bone density, and some ancient tools and artifacts\nshowing evidence of left-hand use. And despite what many may think,\nhandedness is not a choice. It can be predicted even before birth\nbased on the fetus' position in the womb. So, if handedness is inborn,\ndoes that mean it's genetic? Well, yes and no. Identical twins, who have the same genes,\ncan have different dominant hands. In fact, this happens as often as it does\nwith any other sibling pair. But the chances of being\nright or left-handed are determined by the handedness\nof your parents in surprisingly consistent ratios. If your father was left-handed\nbut your mother was right-handed, you have a 17% chance\nof being born left-handed, while two righties will have\na left-handed child only 10% of the time. Handedness seems to be determined\nby a roll of the dice, but the odds are set by your genes. All of this implies there's a reason that evolution has produced\nthis small proportion of lefties, and maintained it\nover the course of millennia. And while there have been several theories attempting to explain why handedness\nexists in the first place, or why most people are right-handed, a recent mathematical model suggests that the actual ratio\nreflects a balance between competitive and cooperative\npressures on human evolution. The benefits of being left-handed are clearest in activities\ninvolving an opponent, like combat or competitive sports. For example, about 50% of top hitters\nin baseball have been left-handed. Why? Think of it as a surprise advantage. Because lefties are a minority\nto begin with, both right-handed\nand left-handed competitors will spend most of their time\nencountering and practicing against righties. So when the two face each other, the left-hander will be better prepared\nagainst this right-handed opponent, while the righty will be thrown off. This fighting hypothesis, where an imbalance in the population results in an advantage for left-handed\nfighters or athletes, is an example of negative\nfrequency-dependent selection. But according to the principles\nof evolution, groups that have a relative advantage tend to grow until\nthat advantage disappears. If people were only fighting and competing\nthroughout human evolution, natural selection would lead to more\nlefties being the ones that made it until there were so many of them, that it was no longer a rare asset. So in a purely competitive world, 50% of the population\nwould be left-handed. But human evolution has been shaped\nby cooperation, as well as competition. And cooperative pressure pushes handedness distribution\nin the opposite direction. In golf, where performance\ndoesn't depend on the opponent, only 4% of top players are left-handed, an example of the wider phenomenon\nof tool sharing. Just as young potential golfers can more easily find\na set of right-handed clubs, many of the important instruments\nthat have shaped society were designed for\nthe right-handed majority. Because lefties are worse\nat using these tools, and suffer from higher accident rates, they would be less successful\nin a purely cooperative world, eventually disappearing\nfrom the population. So by correctly predicting\nthe distribution of left-handed people\nin the general population, as well as matching data\nfrom various sports, the model indicates that the persistence of lefties\nas a small but stable minority reflects an equilibrium that comes from competitive\nand cooperative effects playing out simultaneously over time. And the most intriguing thing is what the numbers can tell us\nabout various populations. From the skewed distribution of pawedness\nin cooperative animals, to the slightly larger\npercentage of lefties in competitive hunter-gatherer societies, we may even find that the answers\nto some puzzles of early human evolution are already in our hands."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How much of the world's population is left-handed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "30%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "17%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Left-handedness is _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A choice made by the individual"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Always genetic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Inborn"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Determined by the position of the fetus in the womb"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What are some ways archaeologists can tell if someone was left-handed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Differences in arm length"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Differences in bone density"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tool use and artifacts"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which pairing of parent handedness gives the best chance of their offspring being left-handed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Both parents are right-handed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mom is left-handed and dad is left-handed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dad is left-handed and mom is right-handed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Offspring can choose to be left or right-handed depending on preference"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If people were only fighting and competing throughout evolution, natural selection would have led _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To more lefties"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To fewer lefties"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To no change in left-handed frequency in the population"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To an elimination of all lefties"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
