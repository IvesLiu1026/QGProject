But instead of the sound of silence, \nyou hear a constant ringing— even though there’s nothing \nmaking any noise. What you’re experiencing \nis called tinnitus, the perception of a noise like ringing, \nbuzzing, hissing or clicking that occurs without any external source \nof sound. Tinnitus has been bothering humanity \nsince Ancient Babylon, plaguing everyone from Leonardo da Vinci \nto Charles Darwin. Today, roughly one in seven people \nworldwide experiences this auditory sensation. So where does this persistent sound \ncome from? When you normally hear something, \nsound waves hit various areas of your ear, creating vibrations that displace fluid \ninside the cochlea. If the vibrations are large enough, they elicit a chemical response \nthat transforms them into bioelectrical signals. These nerve impulses are then relayed \nthrough the hearing pathway to the brain, where they result \nin the sounds we perceive. However, in the vast majority \nof tinnitus cases, the nerve signals that produce \nthese mysterious sounds don’t travel through your ear at all. Instead, they’re generated internally, \nby your own central nervous system. Under usual circumstances, \nthese self-produced signals are an essential part of hearing. All mammals demonstrate \non-going neural activity throughout their hearing pathways. When there are no sounds present, this activity is at a baseline \nthat establishes your neural code for silence. When a sound does appear, \nthis activity changes, allowing the brain to distinguish \nbetween silence and sound. But the auditory system’s health \ncan affect this background signal. Loud noises, diseases, toxins, \nand even natural aging can damage your cochlear cells. Some of these may heal \nin a matter of hours. However, if enough cells die, \neither over time or all at once, the auditory system becomes \nless sensitive. With fewer cochlear cells \nrelaying information, incoming sounds generate \nweaker nerve signals. And many environmental sounds \ncan be lost completely. To compensate, your brain devotes more \nenergy to monitoring the hearing pathway. Just like you might adjust \nthe knobs of a radio, the brain modifies neural activity \nwhile also tweaking the tuning knob to get a clearer signal. Increasing this background neural activity\nis intended to help you process weak auditory inputs. But it can also modify \nyour baseline for silence— such that a lack of sound \nno longer sounds silent at all. This is called subjective tinnitus, and it accounts for the vast majority \nof tinnitus cases. Subjective tinnitus \nis a symptom associated with practically every known ear disorder, but it isn’t necessarily a bad thing. While its appearance can be surprising, subjective tinnitus has no inherently \nnegative consequences. But for some, tinnitus episodes \ncan trigger traumatic memories or otherwise distressing feelings, which increase the sound’s intrusiveness. This psychological loop often leads \nto what’s known as “bothersome tinnitus,\" a condition that can exacerbate \nthe symptoms of PTSD, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. There’s no known cure \nfor subjective tinnitus. So the most important thing \ndoctors can do is help people understand \nthis auditory event, and develop neutral associations \nwith these often-distressing sounds. For example, sound therapy uses noises \nlike rain, birdsong, or music to mask tinnitus and reduce stress. One form, called informational masking, \nuses soothing, complex auditory signals that distract the brain \nfrom the tinnitus sound. Another, called energetic masking, uses sounds with the same frequency \nas the patient’s tinnitus to occupy the neurons that would \notherwise deliver the tinnitus signal. Practiced alongside counseling, these interventions allow \npeople to re-evaluate their relationship with tinnitus. Losing the sound of silence \ncan be troubling to say the least. Tinnitus reveals that your brain is \nconstantly analyzing the world around you, even as it fails to filter \nits own internal noise. In a sense, experiencing tinnitus is like eavesdropping \non your brain talking to itself— though it may not be a conversation \nyou want to hear."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Tinnitus is best described as the perception of a sound that is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "generated in the environment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "generated in the ears of the person who hears it"}, {"label": "C", "text": "generated inside the central nervous system of the person who hears it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "usually hearable by other people in the vicinity of the tinnitus patient"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Tinnitus is most likely to be bothersome to a person when its onset is associated with all but which one of the following?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "trauma"}, {"label": "B", "text": "depression"}, {"label": "C", "text": "anxiety"}, {"label": "D", "text": "gradual onset hearing loss"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The most common form of tinnitus is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "objective tinnitus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "subjective tinnitus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pulsatile tinnitus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "traumatic-onset tinnitus"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In the vast majority of cases, tinnitus is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "bothersome and related to terminal illness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bothersome but not associated with terminal illness"}, {"label": "C", "text": "non-bothersome but an indication of impending deafness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "non-bothersome"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following would be the most achievable objective of tinnitus intervention?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Elimination of the tinnitus sound through use of drugs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elimination of the tinnitus sound through repair of the hair cells in the inner ear"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Use of powerful hearing aids, regardless of hearing loss, to overwhelm the tinnitus sound"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Minimizing the patient’s emotional response in order to foster acceptance of the tinnitus event"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

He wants his heir to be good \nat arithmetic, lucky, and above all else, honest. So he’s devised a competition \nto test his children, and ordered you to choose the winner. Each potential heir will be given \nthe same two six-sided dice. The red die has the numbers \n2, 7, 7, 12, 12, and 17. The blue one has \n3, 8, 8, 13, 13, and 18. The dice are fair, so each side \nis equally likely to come up. Each contestant will be sent \ninto a Royal Rolling Room, where they’ll roll both dice \n20 times. A contestant’s score starts at zero, \nand each turn, they should add the total \nof the two numbers rolled to their score. After 20 turns, they should report \ntheir final score. The rooms are secure, \nand no one observes the rolls. That means a contestant could \nadd incorrectly, or worse, be dishonest and make up a score they didn’t achieve. This is where you come in. The king has instructed you that \nif you’re at least 90% sure a contestant mis-added or cheated, \nyou should disqualify them. The highest-scoring player who remains \nwill be the new heir to the throne. After you explain the rules, \nthe children run to their rooms. When they return, \nAlexa announces her score is 385. Bertram says 840. Cassandra reports 700. \nAnd Draco declares 423. The future of the kingdom \nis in your hands. Whom do you proclaim \nto be the worthiest successor? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Upon inspection, \nmost of these scores are concerning. Let’s start with the highest. Bertram scored 840. That’s impressive… \nbut is it even possible? The highest numbers on the two dice \nare 17 and 18. 17 plus 18 is 35, so in 20 rolls, the greatest possible total \nis 20 times 35, or 700. Even if Bertram rolled \nall the highest numbers, he couldn’t have scored 840. So he’s disqualified. Cassandra, the next-highest roller, \nreported 700. That’s theoretically possible… \nbut how hard is it to be that lucky? In order to get 700, Cassandra would have to roll \nthe highest number out of six on 40 separate occasions. The probability of this is 1 over 6 \nto the 40th power, or 1 in about 13 nonillion— \nthat’s 13 followed by 30 zeros. To put that in perspective, there are \nabout 7.5 billion people in the world, and 7.5 billion squared \nis a lot less than 13 nonillion. Rolling the highest number \nall 40 times is much less likely than if you picked a completely random \nperson on Earth, and it turned out \nto be actor Paul Rudd… and then you randomly picked again, \nand got Paul Rudd again! You can’t be 100% sure that Cassandra’s \nscore didn’t happen by chance… but you can certainly be 90% sure, \nso she should be disqualified. Next up is Draco, with 423. This score isn’t high enough \nto be suspicious. But it’s impossible \nfor a different reason. Pick a number from each die, \nand add them up. No matter which combination you choose, \nthe result ends in a 0 or a 5. That’s because every red number \nis 2 more than a multiple of 5, and every blue number \nis 3 more than a multiple of 5. This means that when you add \nthem together, you’ll always get an exact multiple of 5. And when you add rolls \nthat are multiples of 5, the result will also be a multiple of 5. These sorts of relationships \nbetween integers are studied in a branch of math called number theory. Here number theory shows \nus that Draco’s score, which is not a multiple of 5,\ncannot be achieved. So he should be disqualified as well. This leaves Alexa, \nwhose score is a multiple of 5 and is in the achievable range. In fact, the most likely score is 400, \nso she was a little bit unlucky. But with everyone else disqualified, \nshe’s the last heir standing. All hail Queen Alexa, \nthe worthiest successor!

Ah... humanity... It’s a trainwreck,\nbut I can’t look away. It’s 1843, and a debate is raging \namong physicians about one of the most common \nkillers of women: childbed fever. Childbed fever strikes \nwithin days of giving birth, killing more than 70% of those infected—\nand nobody knows what causes it. Obstetrician Charles Meigs has a theory. Having observed abdominal inflammation in patients who go on \nto develop the fever, he claims this inflammation \nis the cause of childbed fever. Much of the medical establishment\nsupports his theory. Oh, come on! They really leave me no choice \nbut to teach them some skepticism. That’s better. Now, Meigs, your argument is based \non a fallacy— the false cause fallacy. Correlation does not imply causation: When two phenomena regularly occur\ntogether, one does not necessarily \ncause the other. So you say women who have inflammation\nalso come down with childbed fever, therefore the inflammation \ncaused the fever. But that’s not necessarily true. Yes, yes, the inflammation comes first,\nthen the fever, so it seems like the inflammation \ncauses the fever. But by that logic, since babies \nusually grow hair before teeth, hair growth must cause tooth growth. And we all know that’s not true,\nright? Actually, don’t answer that. A couple of different things \ncould be going on here. First, it’s possible that fever \nand inflammation are correlated purely by coincidence. Or, there could be a causal relationship\nthat’s the opposite of what you think— the fever causes the inflammation, rather than the inflammation \ncausing the fever. Or both could share a common \nunderlying cause you haven’t thought of. If I may, just what do you think \ncauses inflammation? Nothing? It just is? Really? Humor me for a moment in discussing\none of your colleague’s ideas— Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. I know, I know, \nyou don’t like his theory— you already wrote \na scathing letter about it. But let’s fill your students in, shall we? Holmes noticed a pattern: \nwhen a patient dies of childbed fever, a doctor performs an autopsy. If the doctor then treats a new patient, that patient often comes \ndown with the fever. Based on this correlation between autopsies of fever victims\nand new fever patients, he proposes a possible cause. Since there’s no evidence that the autopsy\ncauses the fever beyond this correlation, he doesn’t jump to the conclusion \nthat autopsy causes fever. Instead, he suggests that doctors \nare infecting their patients via an invisible contaminant \non their hands and surgical instruments. This idea outrages most doctors, \nwho see themselves as infallible. Like Meigs here, who refuses \nto consider the possibility that he’s playing a role \nin his patients’ plight. His flawed argument doesn’t leave any \npath forward for further investigation— but Holmes’ does. It’s 1847, and physician Ignaz Semmelweis has reduced the number \nof childbed fever deaths in a clinic from 12% to 1% \nby requiring all medical personnel to disinfect their hands after autopsies\nand between patient examinations. With this initiative, he has proven\nthe contagious nature of childbed fever. Ha! It’s 1879, and Louis Pasteur \nhas identified the contaminant responsible \nfor many cases of childbed fever: Hemolytic streptococcus bacteria. Hmm, my fries are cold.

Freshwater eels, or Anguilla Anguilla,\ncould be found in rivers across Europe, but no one had ever seen them mate. And despite countless dissections, no researcher could find eel eggs\nor identify their reproductive organs. Devoid of data, naturalists proposed \nvarious eel origin stories. Aristotle suggested that eels \nspontaneously emerged from mud. Pliny the Elder argued eels \nrubbed themselves against rocks, and the subsequent scrapings \ncame to life. Eels were said to hatch on rooftops,\nmanifest from the gills of other fish, and even emerge \nfrom the bodies of beetles. But the true story of eel reproduction\nis even more difficult to imagine. And to solve this slippery mystery, scholars would have to rethink \ncenturies of research. Today, we know the freshwater eel \nlifecycle has five distinct stages: larval leptocepheli, miniscule glass eels,\nadolescent elvers, older yellow eels, and adult silver eels. Given the radical physical differences \nbetween these phases, you’d be forgiven for assuming \nthese are different animals. In fact, that’s exactly what \nEuropean naturalists thought. Researchers were aware of leptocepheli\nand glass eels, but no one guessed they were related\nto the elvers and yellow eels living hundreds of kilometers upstream. Confusing matters more, eels don’t \ndevelop sex organs until late in life. And the entirety of their time \nin the rivers of Europe is essentially eel adolescence. So when do eels reproduce, \nand where do they do it? Despite its name, the life \nof a freshwater eel actually begins in the salty waters \nof the Bermuda Triangle. At the height of the annual \ncyclone season, thousands of three-millimeter eel larvae drift out of the Sargasso Sea. From here, they follow migration \npaths to North America and Europe— continents that were \nmuch closer when eels established these routes \n40 million years ago. Over the next 300 days, Anguilla Anguilla\nlarvae ride the ocean currents 6,500 km to the coast of Europe— making one of the longest \nknown marine migrations. By the time they arrive, they’ve grown \napproximately 45 mm, and transformed into semi-transparent \nglass eels. It’s not just their appearance \nthat’s changed. If most marine fish entered \nbrackish coastal waters, their cells would swell with freshwater\nin a lethal explosion. But when glass eels reach the coast, their kidneys shift to retain more salt and maintain their blood’s \nsalinity levels. Swarms of these newly freshwater \nfish migrate up streams and rivers, sometimes piling on top of each other\nto clear obstacles and predators. Those that make it upstream develop\ninto opaque elvers. Having finally arrived \nin their hunting grounds, elvers begin to eat everything \nthey can fit into their mouths. These omnivores grow in proportion\nto their diets, and over the next decade they develop\ninto larger yellow eels. In this stage, they grow \nto be roughly 80 cm, and finally develop sexual organs. But the last phase of eel life— \nand the secret of their reproduction— remains mysterious. In 1896, researchers identified \nleptocepheli as larval eels, and deduced that they had come \nto Europe from somewhere in the Atlantic. However, to find this mysterious \nbreeding ground, someone would have to perform \nan unthinkable survey of the ocean for larvae no larger than 30mm. Enter Johannes Schmidt. For the next 18 years, \nthis Danish oceanographer trawled the coasts of four continents, hunting down increasingly \ntiny leptocepheli. Finally, in 1921, he found \nthe smallest larvae yet, on the southern edge \nof the Sargasso Sea. Despite knowledge \nof their round trip migration, scientists still haven’t observed \nmating in the wild, or found a single eel egg. Leading theories suggest \nthat eels reproduce in a flurry of external fertilization, in which clouds of sperm \nfertilize free-floating eggs. But the powerful currents \nand tangling seaweed of the Sargasso Sea have made this theory \ndifficult to confirm. Researchers don’t even know where to look, since they’ve yet to successfully\ntrack an eel over the course of its return migration. Until these challenges can be met, the eel’s ancient secret will continue\nto slip through our fingers."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Many scholars, such as Aristotle found eels but had never seen them", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "eat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "swim"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sleep"}, {"label": "D", "text": "mate"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The freshwater eel lifecycle has how many distinct stages?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Leptocepheli and glass eels are related to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yellow eels"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Moray eels"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Conger eels"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Snipe eels"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Anguilla Anguilla larvae make one of the longest known marine migrations traveling on ocean currents 6,500km from the Sargasso Sea to the", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "South American coast"}, {"label": "B", "text": "European coast"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Anguilla coast"}, {"label": "D", "text": "West African coast"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When elvers arrive upstream to their hunting grounds, they begin everything they can.

Jason would have to tread carefully \nto pry it from King Aeetes’ clutches and win back his promised throne. But diplomacy was hardly \none of the Argonauts’ strengths. Jason would have to navigate \nthis difficult task alone. Or so he thought. Leaving most of his bedraggled crew \nto rest, Jason made for the palace with some \nof his more even-tempered men. His first instinct was to simply ask \nthe king for his prized possession. But Aeetes was enraged \nat the hero’s presumption. If this outsider wanted his treasure, he would have to prove his worth \nby facing three perilous tasks. The trials would begin the following day, \nand Jason was dismissed to prepare. But another member of the royal family \nwas also plotting something. Thanks to the encouragement \nof Jason’s guardians on Mount Olympus, Medea, princess of Colchis \nand priestess of the witch goddess Hecate, had fallen in love with the challenger. She intended to protect her beloved \nfrom her father’s tricks — at any cost. After a sleepless night, Jason \nsomberly marched to the castle— but was intercepted. The princess armed him \nwith strange vials and trinkets, in exchange for a promise \nof eternal devotion. As they whispered \nand planned their victory, both hero and princess fell deeply \nunder each other’s spell. Unaware of his daughter’s scheming, the king confidently led Jason \nto face his first task. The hero was brought \nto a huge field of oxen that lay between him and the fleece, and told that he had to plough the land \naround the crowds of oxen. A simple task— or so Jason thought. But Medea had concocted \na fire-proof ointment, and so he plowed the flickering fields \nunscathed. For the second task, he was given a box of serpent’s teeth \nto plant into the scorched earth. As soon as Jason scattered them, each seed\nsprouted into a bloodthirsty warrior. They burst up around him, \nbarricading his way forward, but Medea had prepared him \nfor this task as well. Hurling a heavy stone she had given him \ninto their midst, the fighters turned on themselves \nas they scrabbled for it, letting him slip by the fray. For the third task, Jason was finally face to face \nwith the guardian of the Fleece. Dodging sharp claws and singeing breath, Jason scrambled up the tree \nand sprinkled a sweet-smelling concoction over the dragon. As the strains of Medea’s incantations \nreached its ears and the potion settled in its eyes, \nthe dragon sank into a deep sleep. Elated, Jason climbed \nto the top of the tallest oak, where he slipped the gleaming fleece \noff its branch. When the king saw the hero \nsprinting away— not only with the fleece, \nbut his daughter in tow— he realized he had been betrayed. Furious, he sent an army \nled by his son Absyrtus to bring the ill-gotten prize \nand his conniving daughter home. But all the players in this tale \nhad underestimated the viciousness of these disgraced lovers. To the horror of the Gods, Jason ran \nhis sword through Absyrtus in cold blood. Medea then helped him scatter pieces \nof the body along the shore, distracting her grieving father \nwhile the Argonauts escaped. As Colchis and their pursuers \ngrew smaller on the horizon, a solemn silence fell aboard the Argo. Jason could now return \nto Thessaly victorious— but his terrible act \nhad tarnished his crew’s honor, and turned the Gods against them.

While we don’t know \nwhere the first Celts came from, by Alexander’s time \nthey had spread across Europe from Asia Minor in the east to Spain and the Atlantic islands of Britain \nand Ireland in the west. The Celts were never one unified empire,\nand they didn’t build cities or monuments. Instead, they were hundreds of independent\ntribes who spoke the same language. Each had its own warrior-king \nand religious center. The tribes fought each other as enthusiastically as they fought \ntheir enemies. Few armies could stand up to them. Somewhat unusually for the time, \nthe Celts believed in reincarnation— that they would be reborn on Earth \nto live and feast and fight again, which may have contributed \nto their fearlessness in battle. Some of them fought naked, \nscoffing at their enemies’ armor. The greatest trophy a Celtic warrior\ncould possess was the severed head of a foe. They preserved these heads \nin jars of cedar oil and showed them to guests \nwho visited their homes. Celtic warriors were so valued \nin the ancient world that foreign kings often hired \nthem as mercenary soldiers to serve in their armies. But the Celts were much more \nthan just warriors. Among them were many skilled craftsmen,\nartists, and great poets called bards. The bards sang of the brave deeds \nof their ancestors and praised the accomplishments\nof warrior kings— and composed biting satires \nabout cowardly or selfish leaders. The Celts worshipped many gods, and priests known as druids \noversaw this worship. Anyone could become a druid, but the training required many years \nof study and memorization— the druids were not allowed to record\nany of their teachings in writing. Druids supervised religious practices \nand sacrifices to the gods, but they were also teachers, healers, \njudges, and scientists. They were so respected that they could\nstep between warring tribes in the middle of a battle \nand call an end to the fighting. No Celt would dare to harm a druid,\nor question their decisions. In the 2nd century BCE, the Romans \nbegan to encroach on Celtic territory, conquering the tribes of northern Italy. Rather than unite against the Roman \nlegions in response to this defeat, the Celts maintained \ntheir tribal divisions. The tribes of Spain fell soon after. In the 1st century BCE, Julius Caesar \nmarched his armies across France, using bribery, threats, and lies \nto turn tribes against each other. Only in the closing days of this great war did the Celts unite \nagainst their common enemy under the leadership \nof king Vercingetorix, but it was too late. Countless warriors and their families \ndied or were enslaved as the Romans conquered France. Protected by the surrounding waters, the Celtic tribes of Britain and Ireland\nwere the last holdouts. When the Romans finally invaded Britain, the queen Boudicca united her tribe \nin a revolt after her husband was killed. She almost succeeded in driving \nthe Roman legions out of Britain before dying as she led a final battle \nagainst the enemy. By the end of the 1st century CE, \nIreland alone, far out at sea, remained unconquered by Rome. There, the ways of the ancient Celts \nsurvived untouched by the outside world long after Rome itself lay in ruins."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Celts Alexander the Great met said they feared", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They would die fighting him"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The earth would swallow them up"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nothing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Romans would conquer them"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Celtic people of ancient Europe were made up of many __________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "small tribes led by respective kings"}, {"label": "B", "text": "democracies ruled by the people"}, {"label": "C", "text": "republics who elected a president"}, {"label": "D", "text": "large empires ruled by the druids"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Songs of praise and satire among the Celts were sung by ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "warriors"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bards"}, {"label": "C", "text": "kings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "children"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Priests known as ______ oversaw the Celts' worship of many gods", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "bards"}, {"label": "B", "text": "celtic monks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Keltoi"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Druids"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What was one part of the Celtic world not conquered by the Romans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Northern Italy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Spain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ireland"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gaul (France)"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

The warrior god Set and his wife, \nthe goddess Nephtys, decorated an extravagant hall \nfor the occasion, with a beautiful wooden chest \nas the centerpiece. They invited all the most important gods,\ndozens of lesser deities, and foreign monarchs. But no one caused as big a stir as Set \nand Nephtys’s older brother Osiris, the god who ruled all of Egypt \nand had brought prosperity to everyone. Set announced a game— whoever could fit perfectly in the chest\ncould have it as a gift. One by one, the guests clambered in,\nbut no one fit. Finally, it was Osiris’s turn. As he lay down, everyone could see\nit was a perfect fit— another win for the god \nwho could do no wrong. Then Set slammed the lid down \nwith Osiris still inside, sealed it shut, and tossed it into the Nile. The chest was a coffin. Set had constructed it specifically \nto trap his brother and planned the party to lure him into it. Set had long been jealous \nof his brother’s successful reign, and hoped to replace \nhim as the ruler of all Egypt. The Nile bore the coffin out to sea \nand it drifted for many days before washing ashore near Byblos, \nwhere a great cedar grew around it. The essence of the god within \ngave the tree a divine aura, and when the king of Byblos noticed it, he ordered the tree cut down\nand brought to his palace. Unbeknownst to him, the coffin containing Egypt’s \nmost powerful god was still inside. Set’s victory seemed complete, \nbut he hadn’t counted on his sisters. Set’s wife Nephtys was also his sister, while their other sister, \nthe goddess Isis, was married to their brother Osiris. Isis was determined to find Osiris, and enlisted Nephtys’s help \nbehind Set’s back. The two sisters took the shape \nof falcons and travelled far and wide. Some children who had seen \nthe coffin float by pointed them to the palace of Byblos. Isis adopted a new disguise \nand approached the palace. The queen was so charmed \nby the disguised goddess that she entrusted her \nwith nursing the baby prince. Isis decided to make the child immortal \nby bathing him in flame. When the horrified queen \ncame upon this scene, Isis revealed herself \nand demanded the tree. When she cut the coffin from the trunk\nand opened it, Osiris was dead inside. Weeping, she carried his body \nback to Egypt and hid it in a swamp, while she set off in search \nof a means of resurrecting him. But while she was gone, Set found the body \nand cut it into many pieces, scattering them throughout Egypt. Isis had lost Osiris for the second time,\nbut she did not give up. She searched all over the land,\ntraveling in a boat of papyrus. One by one, she tracked down \nthe parts of her husband’s dismembered body\nin every province of Egypt, holding a funeral for each piece. At long last, she had recovered\nevery piece but one— his penis, \nwhich a fish in the Nile had eaten. Working with what she had, Isis \nreconstructed and revived her husband. But without his penis, \nOsiris was incomplete. He could not remain among the living, could not return to his old position \nas ruler of Egypt. Instead, he would have to rule over Duat,\nthe realm of the dead.

Upon noticing his lucky birthmark, townsfolk predicted \nhe would marry a princess. But soon, these rumors reached the ears \nof the wicked king. Enraged, the king stole the child away, \nand sent him hurtling down the river. But the infant’s luck proved greater \nthan the king’s plan. Years later, the king \nwas traveling his realm, when he spotted a strapping young man \nwith an uncanny birthmark. After confirming the child’s origins, the sly king entrusted the boy \nwith a letter for the queen. The youth eagerly set out \nto deliver the message— not knowing he was carrying \nhis own death sentence. That night, roaming bandits \nstumbled upon his camp. Yet when they read the brutal letter, \nthey were filled with pity. Deciding to make trouble for the king \ninstead, they scribbled a new note. As soon as the youth \narrived at the palace, he locked eyes with the princess. The two felt destined for each other. And when the queen read \nthat the king approved this union, she joyfully organized \na whirlwind wedding. When the king returned, \nhe was furious. But he couldn’t execute his daughter’s \nbeloved without reason. So he devised a diabolical trial. He ordered the youth \nto travel to Hell itself, and return with three golden hairs \nfreshly plucked from the Devil’s head. Only upon succeeding \ncould he return to his bride. The youth searched across the land \nfor the entrance to Hell, until he finally reached \nan eerie village. Here, he saw some villagers \ngathered around a well. They closed in on the youth, \nrefusing to let him pass until he answered their question: \nwhy was the well dry? The youth replied, \n“I will answer when I return.” They directed him further into town, where he came across another set \nof villagers contemplating a gnarled tree. They refused to let him pass \nuntil he answered their question: why was the tree barren? Again, the youth responded, \n“I will answer when I return.\" These villagers guided him to the dock, \nwhere an elderly ferryman awaited. As he paddled through the black water, \nthe ferryman rasped a third question: how can I escape my interminable task? Once more, the youth promised, \n“I will answer when I return.” At last, they reached a hut sinking \ninto the swampy banks of Hell. Reluctantly, the youth knocked \non the rotting door. The devil’s grandmother \nanswered his call. She was known to help some visiting souls,\nand harm others. The youth had just finished his story \nwhen they heard the devil’s footsteps. Without warning, \nthe boy’s world appeared to shrink. The devil’s grandmother lifted him \ninto the folds of her sleeve, and welcomed her grandson. The old woman set to work, \nlavishing the devil with food and drink. When he fell asleep, she deftly plucked \nthree gleaming hairs from his head. With each plucked hair, the Devil briefly \nawoke and complained about his dreams, full of nearby villagers \nand their problems. The next morning, the youth departed— armed with three golden hairs, \nand three pieces of information. He shared the devil’s first dream \nwith the ferryman. If the boatman could hand his oars \nto a willing passenger, he would be free from his task. Back at the village, the youth declared \nthat there was a mouse gnawing at the root of the tree, \nand an enormous toad blocking the well. The villagers rewarded him handsomely \nfor his help. Back from his journey, the youth thrust \nthe devil’s hairs at the king— but his greedy father-in-law \nonly had eyes for the gold.

He’d published articles \nin international journals and his textbooks were required reading. Yet his application was firmly rejected \nfor one simple reason— Nicolas Bourbaki did not exist. Two decades earlier, \nmathematics was in disarray. Many established mathematicians had lost \ntheir lives in the first World War, and the field had become fragmented. Different branches used disparate \nmethodology to pursue their own goals. And the lack of a shared \nmathematical language made it difficult to share \nor expand their work. In 1934, a group of French mathematicians \nwere particularly fed up. While studying at the prestigious \nÉcole normale supérieure, they found the textbook \nfor their calculus class so disjointed that they decided to write a better one. The small group \nquickly took on new members, and as the project grew, \nso did their ambition. The result was \nthe \"Éléments de mathématique,\" a treatise that sought to create \na consistent logical framework unifying every branch of mathematics. The text began \nwith a set of simple axioms— laws and assumptions it would use \nto build its argument. From there, its authors derived \nmore and more complex theorems that corresponded with work \nbeing done across the field. But to truly reveal common ground, the group needed to identify \nconsistent rules that applied to a wide range of problems. To accomplish this, they gave new, \nclear definitions to some of the most important \nmathematical objects, including the function. It’s reasonable to think of functions \nas machines that accept inputs and produce an output. But if we think of functions \nas bridges between two groups, we can start to make claims about \nthe logical relationships between them. For example, consider a group of numbers\nand a group of letters. We could define a function where \nevery numerical input corresponds to the same alphabetical output, but this doesn’t establish \na particularly interesting relationship. Alternatively, we could define a function \nwhere every numerical input corresponds to a different \nalphabetical output. This second function sets up \na logical relationship where performing a process on the input \nhas corresponding effects on its mapped output. The group began to define functions by how\nthey mapped elements across domains. If a function’s output came \nfrom a unique input, they defined it as injective. If every output can be mapped \nonto at least one input, the function was surjective. And in bijective functions, each element \nhad perfect one to one correspondence. This allowed mathematicians to establish \nlogic that could be translated across the function’s domains \nin both directions. Their systematic approach \nto abstract principles was in stark contrast to the popular \nbelief that math was an intuitive science, and an over-dependence on logic \nconstrained creativity. But this rebellious band of scholars \ngleefully ignored conventional wisdom. They were revolutionizing the field, \nand they wanted to mark the occasion with their biggest stunt yet. They decided to publish \n\"Éléments de mathématique\" and all their subsequent work \nunder a collective pseudonym: Nicolas Bourbaki. Over the next two decades, Bourbaki’s \npublications became standard references. And the group’s members took their prank \nas seriously as their work. Their invented mathematician claimed \nto be a reclusive Russian genius who would only meet \nwith his selected collaborators. They sent telegrams in Bourbaki’s name, \nannounced his daughter’s wedding, and publicly insulted anyone \nwho doubted his existence. In 1968, when they could \nno longer maintain the ruse, the group ended their joke \nthe only way they could. They printed Bourbaki’s obituary,\ncomplete with mathematical puns. Despite his apparent death, the group \nbearing Bourbaki’s name lives on today. Though he’s not associated \nwith any single major discovery, Bourbaki’s influence informs \nmuch current research. And the modern emphasis on formal proofs\nowes a great deal to his rigorous methods. Nicolas Bourbaki may have been imaginary— \nbut his legacy is very real."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What to do when you find unsatisfactory scientific explanations (in textbooks and/or research papers): given it’s a field of your interest and you think you can do a better job?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Complain about it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Give up and do something else"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Do something about it: one option would be - Form a secret society, seriously do tangible work for years, publish your results under a collective pseudonym and change the course of the field."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Nicholas Bourbaki was a", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "real mathematician"}, {"label": "B", "text": "hoax"}, {"label": "C", "text": "collective pseudonym"}, {"label": "D", "text": "physicist"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is an injective function?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Where all elements that can be obtained in the set of outputs – can be traced to a unique element in the set of inputs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Where all elements that can be obtained in the set of outputs – cannot be traced to a unique element in the set of inputs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All elements in the set of outputs can be traced to one or more elements in the set of inputs"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is a surjective function?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Where all elements that can be obtained in the set of outputs– can be traced to a unique element in the set of inputs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Where all elements that can be obtained in the set of outputs – cannot be traced to a unique element in the set of inputs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All elements in the set of outputs can be traced to one or more elements in the set of inputs"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is a bijective function?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Where all outputs that can be obtained – can be traced to a unique input"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Where all outputs that can be obtained – cannot be traced to a unique input"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All elements in the set of outputs can be traced to one or more elements in the set of inputs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A function that is injective as well as surjective"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

{"page": 84, "lesson": 12, "title": "What do all languages have in common? - Cameron Morin", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-do-all-languages-have-in-common-cameron-morin", "transcript": {"en": "Language is endlessly variable. Each of us can come up with \nan infinite number of sentences in our native language, and we’re able to do so from an early age— almost as soon as we start \nto communicate in sentences. How is this possible? In the early 1950s, Noam Chomsky \nproposed a theory based on the observation that the key \nto this versatility seems to be grammar: the familiar grammatical structure \nof an unfamiliar sentence points us toward its meaning. He suggested that there are \ngrammatical rules that apply to all languages,\nand that the rules are innate— the human brain is hardwired to process\nlanguage according to these rules. He labelled this faculty \nuniversal grammar, and it launched lines of inquiry \nthat shaped both the field of linguistics and the emerging field \nof cognitive science for decades to come. Chomsky and other researchers \nset out to investigate the two main components \nof universal grammar: first, whether there are, in fact, \ngrammar rules that are universal to all languages, and, second, whether these rules \nare hardwired in the brain. In attempts to establish \nthe universal rules of grammar, Chomsky developed an analytical tool\nknown as generative syntax, which represents the order of words \nin a sentence in hierarchical syntax trees that show what structures are possible. Based on this tree, we could suggest \na grammar rule that adverbs must occur in verb phrases. But with more data, \nit quickly becomes clear that adverbs can appear \noutside of verb phrases. This simplified example illustrates \na major problem: it takes a lot of data \nfrom each individual language to establish the rules for that language, before we can even begin to determine which rules all languages \nmight have in common. When Chomsky proposed universal grammar, many languages lacked the volume \nof recorded samples necessary to analyze them \nusing generative syntax. Even with lots of data, mapping the structure of a language\nis incredibly complex. After 50 years of analysis, we still\nhaven’t completely figured out English. As more linguist data \nwas gathered and analyzed, it became clear that languages \naround the world differ widely, challenging the theory that there were \nuniversal grammar rules. In the 1980s, Chomsky revised his theory in an attempt to accommodate \nthis variation. According to his new hypothesis \nof principles and parameters, all languages shared certain \ngrammatical principles, but could vary in their parameters, \nor the application of these principles. For example, a principle is \n“every sentence must have a subject,\" but the parameter of whether the subject\nmust be explicitly stated could vary between languages. The hypothesis of principles \nand parameters still didn’t answer the question of which\ngrammatical principles are universal. In the early 2000s, Chomsky suggested \nthat there’s just one shared principle, called recursion, which means structures\ncan be nested inside each other. Take this sentence, which embeds a sentence within a sentence \nwithin a sentence. Or this sentence, which embeds \na noun phrase in a noun phrase in a noun phrase. Recursion was a good candidate \nfor a universal grammar rule because it can take many forms. However, in 2005 linguists \npublished findings on an Amazonian language called Piraha, which doesn’t appear to have \nany recursive structures. So what about the other part \nof Chomsky’s theory, that our language faculty is innate? When he first proposed universal grammar, the idea that there was a genetically \ndetermined aspect of language acquisition had a profound, revolutionary impact. It challenged the dominant paradigm, \ncalled behaviorism. Behaviorists argued that all animal \nand human behaviors, including language, were acquired from the outside \nby the mind, which starts out as a blank slate. Today, scientists agree that behaviorism \nwas wrong, and there is underlying, \ngenetically encoded biological machinery for language learning. Many think the same biology \nresponsible for language is also responsible for other \naspects of cognition. So they disagree with Chomsky’s idea that there is a specific, isolated,\ninnate language faculty in the brain. The theory of universal grammar\nprompted the documentation and study of many languages \nthat hadn’t been studied before. It also caused an old idea to be \nreevaluated and eventually overthrown to make room for our growing \nunderstanding of the human brain."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What scientific paradigm prevailed before Chomsky’s theory emerged?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rationalism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Empiricism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Behaviorism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Logical positivism"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What language posed a durable problem to the principle of recursion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Quechua"}, {"label": "B", "text": "English"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Italian"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Piraha"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What was Chomsky’s main analytical tool in his studies of language?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Generative phonology"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Generative morphology"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Generative syntax"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Generative semantics"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What discipline was Universal Grammar couched in first and foremost?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cognitive science"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Linguistics"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Philosophy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Psychology"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When did Chomsky start developing his theory of Universal Grammar?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1950s"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1960s"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1970s"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1980s"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 84, "lesson": 13, "title": "First person vs. Second person vs. Third person - Rebekah Bergman", "category": "Writing/Composition", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/first-person-vs-second-person-vs-third-person-rebekah-bergman", "transcript": {"en": "“I am an invisible man.” “Mrs. Dalloway said she would \nbuy the flowers herself.” “You are about to begin reading \nItalo Calvino's new novel.” These three opening lines, \nfrom Ralph Ellison’s \"Invisible Man,\" Virginia Woolf’s \"Mrs. Dalloway,\" and Italo Calvino’s \n\"If on a winter’s night a traveler,\" each establish a different point of view. Who is telling a story, \nand from what perspective, are some of the most important choices \nan author makes. Told from a different point of view, \na story can transform completely. Take this fairytale: \"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\"\nthe Prince called, \"let down your hair.\" Rapunzel unbraided her hair \nand slung it out the window. The prince climbed her tresses \ninto the tower. Rapunzel is typically told like this, \nwith the narrator outside the story. This point of view is called third person. But Rapunzel can also be told \nby a character in the story— a first person narrator. The tail end of Rapunzel’s locks \nplopped down at my feet. I grabbed on and began to climb… ugh! I couldn’t untangle myself. Strands came off all over me, \nsticking to my sweat. In a first person narrative, the story \ncan change dramatically depending on which character\nis the narrator. Say Rapunzel was narrating \ninstead of the prince: I hope he appreciates how long it takes \nto unbraid 25 feet of hair, I thought. OUCH! I'll be honest; I thought my scalp\nwould stretch off of my skull. \"Can you climb any faster?\" I yelled. In second person, the narrator addresses \nthe story to the reader: He calls your name. He wants you \nto let your hair down. You just finished braiding it, but hey–\nyou don't get a lot of visitors. Third person, first person, \nand second person perspectives each have unique possibilities\nand constraints. So how do you choose a point \nof view for your story? Constraints aren’t necessarily \na bad thing— they can help focus a story \nor highlight certain elements. For example, a third person narrator is necessarily\na bit removed from the characters. But that can be good for stories \nwhere a feeling of distance is important. A third person narrator \ncan be either limited, meaning they stick close to one \ncharacter’s thoughts and feelings, or they can be omniscient, \nable to flit between characters’ minds and give the reader more information. A first person story creates closeness \nbetween the reader and the narrator. It’s also restricted \nby the narrator’s knowledge. This can create suspense as the reader finds out information\nalong with the character. A first person narrator \ndoesn’t necessarily have to represent the character’s \nexperience faithfully— they can be delusional or dishonest. In Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel \n\"The Remains of the Day,\" Stevens, an aging British butler in 1956, \nrecounts his many years of service, but fails to acknowledge the flaws \nof the man he serves. The cracks in his narrative eventually \ndraw the reader’s attention to the under-acknowledged failings \nof the culture and class system he inhabits. Justin Torres’s novel, \"We the Animals,\" begins with a plural \nfirst person narrator: “We were six snatching hands, \nsix stomping feet; we were brothers, boys, three little kings\nlocked in a feud for more.” Partway through the story, \nthe point of view shifts to first person singular,\nfrom we to I, as the boys come of age and one brother feels alienated\nfrom the others. Second person is a less common choice. It requires the writer to make the reader\nsuspend disbelief to become another “you.” Placing the reader \nin a character’s perspective can build urgency and suspense. Sometimes, though, second person is intended to distance \nthe narrator from their own story, rather than bring the reader closer \nto the story. In these cases, second person narrators refer \nto themselves as “you” rather than “I.” Writers are constantly experimenting \nwith fresh variations on point of view. New virtual and augmented \nreality technologies may expand the possibilities\nfor this experimentation. By placing people at a particular \nvantage point in virtual space, how might we change the way \nwe tell and experience stories?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Point of view answers which of these questions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Where and when does the story take place?"}, {"label": "B", "text": "What is the main message or lesson of the story?"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Who is the narrator, and what is their relationship to the story?"}, {"label": "D", "text": "What problem is the main character trying to solve?"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A ___ narrator is a character inside the story who describes the events of the story using the pronouns “I” and “me.”", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "third person omniscient"}, {"label": "B", "text": "second person"}, {"label": "C", "text": "first person"}, {"label": "D", "text": "third person limited"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these passages is told in third person point of view?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Your mother tells you to go visit your sick grandmother.

Here the last artifact—\nthe Node of Memory— is suspended within a force field \nand powering a supercomputer. Ethic is about to deactivate the force\nfield when Lemma stops her. She explains, a decade ago, \nshe was assigned a research task: to use the world machine to create \nsomething that would make everyone happy. After many failed attempts, Lemma \ndiscovered a compound that, when ingested, made people motivated, happy, creative, \nloving… in short, their best selves. It was rushed into production. Soon, the entire nation’s food supply \ncame from Huxenborg, with the compound mixed in. The first year was paradise. The second, not so much. Side-effects began to emerge: memory-loss,\nlistlessness, and self-absorption. In the third year, \nthe government dissolved, leaving the robots running everything \nin a self-sustaining loop. By this point things were too far gone\nfor Lemma to reverse. People had become dependent \non the compound, and the few who refused it \nformed a resistance to try to fix things. It took 10 years for Lemma to find a cure. This factory contains everything \nshe’ll need to make it, but the second they take \nthe Node of Memory, the security system will alert the robots,\nand they’ll have to run. If, instead, they first reconfigure \nthe factory to manufacture the cure, the people can be saved. Lemma has the whole factory redesign \nplanned out. The problem is… \nit’s a little hard to read. Her schematic shows all the steps \nin the manufacturing process needed to make the cure. An arrow from “add nitric acid” \nto “shake vigorously” means that the acid addition \nhas to happen before shaking. If a single step is performed \nout of order, the cure won’t work, or worse. There aren’t any circular references,\nwhere step A requires step B and step B eventually requires step A. Here’s where Ethic and Hedge come in. Lemma needs Hedge to translate \nthe tangled diagram into a sequence of steps. That’ll be the order that things happen \nin the factory. Once input into the central computer, the factory will reassemble \nitself as instructed. Hedge’s ability to store information \nin a table will help here. So how does Ethic program Hedge \nto turn out a correct sequence that can reconfigure the factory? Pause now to figure it out yourself. Rules in 3 Rules in 2 Rules in 1 Hint in 3 Hint in 2 Hint in 1 It may help to first think about \nthis problem as a human, rather than a machine. Given this diagram, it’s clear to start \nwith getting a bowl, since no arrows point to it. How might you mark up the diagram \nto figure out what to do next? Pause now to figure it out yourself. Solution in 3 Solution in 2 Solution in 1 Diagrams like the one Lemma has drawn\nare called directed acyclic graphs. A graph is a representation of data \nthat shows different elements and how they’re related to each other. Directed means that direction matters—\nas indicated by the arrows. Here A leads to B, \nbut B doesn’t lead to A. And acyclic means that there \naren’t any loops. Which is fortunate, because if there were,\nthis problem wouldn’t be solvable. There’s a simple way to navigate \nthe graph as a human: start with a step that doesn’t have \nany arrows pointing to it. Once you do that, cross out that step \nand all arrows leading from it. Choose another step with no arrows \npointing to it, and repeat until you’ve hit every step. There are two things here that are tricky\nto translate for a robot. First, how do you keep track \nof the information? And second, what do you do if there\nare multiple options at the same time? For the first challenge, a convenient way for machines \nto store information is in a table. In this case, you can have Hedge \nlist every step in the headers of both the rows and columns. Then he can go through \nthe rows one at a time. On the schematic, what points to mix? Both shake and titrate. So Hedge should make a mark \nin both of their columns. He can do the same for every row, \none at a time, to make a table like this. Of course the full table \nwill be much bigger. Like a human, \nHedge will also want to start from one of the steps that has \nno arrows pointing to it— which is the same as having no marks \nin its row. If there’s more than one, a convenient way to choose is to pick \nthe one that’s alphabetically earliest, though other selection methods \ncan work just as well. Next, Hedge can add that step \nto his running-order list, delete its entire column from the table— thus removing all the times \nit was a dependency–– and loop back to the start. Because there are no circular \nreferences in the graph, each time we get here there’ll be at least\none step with no remaining dependencies. Hedge can add the alphabetically earliest \nto his running-order list, remove it from the table, \nand loop back to the start again. So now we have a working loop, and it’ll run through all the elements \nin our table until none are left. Hedge drifts back and forth \nover the schematics, and soon he starts spitting \nout instructions, which Ethic uses to configure \nthe assembly lines. With the three working together, they churn out thousands of doses \nof the cure in no time. Ethic finally plucks the Node of Memory from its holding field \nand trips the alarm. Within seconds bots are everywhere. As Ethic falls in shock, the Node \nrestores not only her own memories, but reveals the last, missing pieces\nof the puzzle. Ethic built Hedge with a singular purpose: to construct a maze that would protect \nthe world machine from a corrupt government. But in her haste, \nshe made a critical mistake. She forgot to set the condition \nthat would end the loop which told Hedge \nhow large the maze should be. So Hedge built and built \nuntil he could build no longer. And then he was conflicted. He had to build a maze. But he couldn’t build further \nwithout hurting people or flying over the Bradbarrier, both forbidden by his programming. So he wandered the land \nand searched for a solution, until he happened upon the Node of Power, \nthe Node of Creation, and the Node of Memory. He recognized their true, \ncollective power to grant self-awareness \nto those who lack it. With all three he’d be able \nto change his programming and fulfill his drive to transform \nthe entire world into a giant maze. It wouldn’t be easy: the Nodes had safeguards to prevent \nrobots from taking and using them. But if Hedge could find the right human and manipulate her \nwith the promise of a heroic quest… well that would be a different story. A very different story."}, "multiple-choice": []}

temperature cushions our joints and even lubricates our eyes you produce around 1.5 L of urine every day with another liter lost from breathing sweating and pooping so it's essential that the body replaces this liquid The Thirst center of the brain is located in the hypothalamus and is constantly using sensors in your blood vessels to monitor the amount of sodium and other substances in your body for example if you sweat too much your blood volume and pressure fall the brain then detects this change and creates the urge to drink something now so what happens if you're unable to satisfy this thirst the initial signs of dehydration are the obvious dry mouth following which your urine becomes darker with a stronger odor as your body attempts to conserve more fluids the lack of H2O then begins to affect your brain you might feel light-headed have a slower response time and decreased ability to feel pain in fact when you're dehydrated your brain tissue literally shrinks in studies observing hydrated versus dehydrated participants the same task required more brain power and oxygen in dehydrated individuals compared to those fully hydrated after a day or two with no fluids you'll

The results show that one sister \nis 10% French, the other 0%. Both sisters share the same two parents, and therefore the same set \nof ancestors. So how can one be 10% more French \nthan the other? Tests like these rely on our DNA \nto answer questions about our ancestry, but our DNA actually \ncan’t tell us everything about who we are or where we’re from. DNA tests are great \nat answering some questions, like who your parents are, but \ncan provide baffling results to others, like whether you have ancestors \nfrom a particular region. To understand why, it helps to know where\nour DNA comes from in the first place. Each person’s DNA consists \nof about 6 billion base pairs stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes—\n46 total. That may seem like a dizzying amount \nof information, but 99% of our genome \nis shared among all humans. The remaining 1% contains everything\ndistinct about an individual’s ancestry. Commercial DNA tests utilize \nless than 1% of that 1%. One chromosome in each pair \ncomes from each parent. These halves join at conception: \nwhen a sperm and egg, each with only 23 chromosomes, \ncombine. The story of our ancestry becomes\nmuddled before conception. That’s because the 23 chromosomes \nin a sperm or egg aren’t identical to the chromosomes \nof every other cell in the body. As they go from a cell with 46 \nchromosomes to a sex cell with only 23, the chromosomes within each pair \nswap some sections. This process is called recombination, \nand it means that every sperm or egg contains single chromosomes \nthat are a unique mash up of each pair. Recombination occurs uniquely \nin each sex cell— making two sisters’ chromosomes different\nnot only from their parents’, but from each other’s. Recombination happens before conception, so you get exactly half of your DNA \nfrom each parent, but going further back \nthings get more complicated. Without recombination, you would get \n1/4 from each grandparent, 1/8 from each great-grandparent, \nand so on, but because recombination happens \nevery generation, those numbers vary. The more generations removed \nan ancestor is, the more likely they won’t be represented\nin your DNA at all. For example, without recombination, just 1/64 of your DNA would come \nfrom each ancestor six generations back. Because of recombination, \nthat number can be higher, though we don’t know for sure how high—\nor it can as low as 0. So one sister isn’t more French in the sense of having more \nancestors from France. Instead, the French ancestors are simply\nmore represented in her DNA. But the story doesn’t end there. Tests don’t trace the DNA \nof the sisters' actual French ancestors— we don’t have access to the genomes \nof deceased individuals from previous generations. Instead, these results \nare based on a comparison to the DNA of people \nliving in France today. The tests look for genetic markers, \nor combinations of genetic markers. These markers are short sequences \nthat appear in specific places. The sister deemed \"more French\" \nshares genetic markers with people currently living in France. The assumption is that these \nshared markers indicate ancestors from the same place: France. It’s important to note that results \nare based on people who’ve had their genomes sequenced— 80-90% of which are of European descent. Many indigenous peoples \nare barely represented, if at all. The test won’t reveal heritage from people\nnot represented in the database, and shouldn’t be used to prove \nrace or ethnicity. And as more people get sequenced, \nyour results might change. Looking further back, you may get a result\nlike 2% Neanderthal. Though Neanderthals were a separate \nspecies from humans, that 2% doesn’t come out of the 99% \nof our genome shared among all humans, but the 1% that varies. That’s because about 40,000 years ago, certain human populations \ninterbred with Neanderthals, meaning some people alive today \nhave Neanderthal ancestors. Many Neanderthal ancestors, in fact: there are so many generations \nin 40,000 years that a single Neanderthal’s genetic \ncontribution would be untraceable. You can be both 100% French \nand 2% Neanderthal— though both come from the 1% \nof DNA that makes us different, they’re accounting for different things.

{"page": 84, "lesson": 22, "title": "When is a pandemic over?", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/when-is-a-pandemic-over", "transcript": {"en": "Consider this unfortunately \nfamiliar scenario. Several months ago a highly infectious,\nsometimes deadly respiratory virus infected humans for the first time. It then proliferated faster \nthan public health measures could contain it. Now the World Health Organization (WHO)\nhas declared a pandemic, meaning that it’s spreading worldwide. The death toll is starting to rise \nand everyone is asking the same question: when will the pandemic end? The WHO will likely declare \nthe pandemic over once the infection is mostly contained and rates of transmission drop \nsignificantly throughout the world. But exactly when that happens depends on\nwhat global governments choose to do next. They have three main options: Race through it, Delay and Vaccinate, \nor Coordinate and Crush. One is widely considered best, \nand it may not be the one you think. In the first, governments and communities \ndo nothing to halt the spread and instead allow people to be exposed \nas quickly as possible. Without time to study the virus, doctors know little about \nhow to save their patients, and hospitals reach peak capacity \nalmost immediately. Somewhere in the range of millions \nto hundreds of millions of people die, either from the virus \nor the collapse of health care systems. Soon the majority of people \nhave been infected and either perished or survived\nby building up their immune responses. Around this point herd immunity kicks in, where the virus can no longer\nfind new hosts. So the pandemic fizzles out \na short time after it began. But there’s another way to create \nherd immunity without such a high cost of life. Let’s reset the clock to the moment \nthe WHO declared the pandemic. This time, governments and communities\naround the world slow the spread of the virus \nto give research facilities time to produce a vaccine. They buy this crucial time through tactics\nthat may include widespread testing to identify carriers, quarantining the infected \nand people they’ve interacted with, and physical distancing. Even with these measures in place, \nthe virus slowly spreads, causing up to hundreds of thousands \nof deaths. Some cities get the outbreak under control\nand go back to business as usual, only to have a resurgence and return to physical distancing \nwhen a new case passes through. Within the next several years, one or possibly several vaccines become \nwidely, and hopefully freely, available thanks to a worldwide effort. Once 40-90% of the population \nhas received it— the precise amount varying \nbased on the virus— herd immunity kicks in, \nand the pandemic fizzles out. Let’s rewind the clock one more time, \nto consider the final strategy: Coordinate and Crush. The idea here is to simultaneously starve\nthe virus, everywhere, through a combination of quarantine, \nsocial distancing, and restricting travel. The critical factor \nis to synchronize responses. In a typical pandemic, \nwhen one country is peaking, another may be getting its first cases. Instead of every leader responding \nto what’s happening in their jurisdiction, here everyone must treat the world \nas the giant interconnected system it is. If coordinated properly, this could end \na pandemic in just a few months, with low loss of life. But unless the virus is completely \neradicated— which is highly unlikely— there will be risks of it escalating \nto pandemic levels once again. And factors like animals carrying \nand transmitting the virus might undermine \nour best efforts altogether. So which strategy is best for this deadly,\ninfectious respiratory virus? Racing through it is a quick fix, \nbut would be a global catastrophe, and may not work at all \nif people can be reinfected. Crushing the virus through Coordination \nalone is also enticing for its speed, but only reliable with true \nand nearly impossible global cooperation. That’s why vaccination, assisted by \nas much global coordination as possible, is generally considered to be the winner; it’s the slow, steady, \nand proven option in the race. Even if the pandemic officially ends \nbefore a vaccine is ready, the virus may reappear seasonally, so \nvaccines will continue to protect people. And although it may take years to create, disruptions to most people’s lives \nwon’t necessarily last the full duration. Breakthroughs in treatment \nand prevention of symptoms can make viruses much less dangerous, and therefore require less extreme \ncontainment measures. Take heart: the pandemic will end. Its legacy will be long-lasting,\nbut not all bad; the breakthroughs, social services, \nand systems we develop can be used to the betterment of everyone. And if we take inspiration \nfrom the successes and lessons from the failures, we can keep the next potential \npandemic so contained that our children’s children \nwon’t even know its name."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When would the World Health Organization (WHO) likely declare that a pandemic is over?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When the death toll decreases"}, {"label": "B", "text": "When infection is mostly contained"}, {"label": "C", "text": "When the global rates of transmission drop substantially"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both b and c"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which government and community tactic is used when nothing is done to halt the spread of the disease exposure?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Race through it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Delay and vaccinate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Coordinate and crush"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Herd transmission"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When __________ immunity kicks in, the virus can longer find new hosts and the pandemic loses strength.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Total"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Viral"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Herd"}, {"label": "D", "text": "maximum"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the main advantage of delaying the global spread of a disease?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ensure hospitals do not reach their peak capacity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Enables research facilities to produce a vaccine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ensures there are sufficient medical staff available"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Decrease the total number of people infected"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Crushing the virus is only possible if which of the following occurs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Strict travel restrictions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Social distancing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Global cooperation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Shelter in place mandates"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Moro [Music] oh I still haven't got any ideas what to paint we should go for a walk and find something fun and exciting and different to paint my painting is exciting it's always [Music] changing now it really looks exciting yeah it's like it's really moving it looks like the butterflies brought us to flitter flutter land ah I was not expecting my guests to arrive until later huh oh guests oh I love garden parties it's not a garden party it's a Suare an evening Gathering because we artists are busy painting outside in the day hey look Maddie she paints like dancing butterflies quickly and gently well have you ever noticed that when you're really looking at something your eyes do the same thing ever so gently and quickly Dart all around it oh and this must be how butterflies see but everything looks pretty blurry to me W the D dizzy and so who is it you came with M mon Renoir hey I know those names they're impressionist painters yes that's what the critics call us Impressionists it's actually quite fitting because we paint the impression of what we see you see I'm painting this area of grass right right here but just now it changed color because the light changed and so that's what I paint my impression how I see it w the grass changed color magic grass so you're one of them you're an impressionist painter ah well as in most notorious gangs I'm the woman in the group ber Moro a gang of impressionist that sounds exciting I read that art salons are when artists and Friends get together to talk about about art and how fun it is oh how challenging it can be ah but that's part of the funa H well this impressionist has the impression that the sun has gone for the day yeah and the bright colors well perhaps it's time for a little snack we I bought some cant at the paer this morning would you mind bringing my easel for me yes Maddie come and see this it's like the painting that I did well there is a toy sailboat in it and it looks sunny and Shady too and windy I can almost feel [Music] it [Music] ah wow it looks like it's frozen in time like it's behind a frosty window yeah you can see movement everywhere and there even though it's just a calm scene the woman looks relaxed but very focused on her work and the little girl it's like we can see her daydreaming I can almost see a fairy beside her that's what impressionist painting is all about capturing fast fleeting moments the sparkling play of sunlight and Shadow can make the most simple and tranquil of scenes colorful and full of energy Manny look look at this colorful and energetic this one is my young woman knitting full of energy and movement I can really feel how busy she is knitting stitch by Stitch he even the brush Strokes look like stitches wo the do crazy hey yeah it really does look like it's all stitched together whoa that painting looks different from far away I see a gr triangle at the top and a beige triangle on the bottom and and the chair is half off the canvas when the eye looks at the chair the woman knitting seems in Focus have you ever noticed how when your eyes look at something what they see at the edge is not really in Focus but it appears to be nothing's in focus when you're following a butterfly wo hey when you look at her dress you only see white fast lines but when your eyes look at something else or dance around it like a butterfly you see shimmering light on her dress whoa Madame moiso from here it's like you painted soft velvety flower petals but of close I see only squiggles and dashes of color but from way back here they look like a girl sitting on a chair vision is more than just looking it's what you see and how you look your impression if I were to paint you I would want to see how the light looks on you and paint that the eyes see more of an impression towards the edge of your view ah so by looking slightly away you see shape and color and paint that instead of the exact details everywhere I look I see something to paint my eyes are dancing around everything T wao everything's different it's the lighting it changes everything so then there's always something new to paint really I could paint the same thing at different times of the day or different times of the year and it will be a different painting every time I can't wait to paint the way I see things this is going to be fun let's go MD oh but you're well you must come back againa goodbye how are you doing Maddie I'm having lots of fun there's so much going going on here I'm almost done come and see huh well you have to move your head like this see I call it play to the butterflies because they wouldn't stop moving I sent my belt spinning [Laughter] [Music] wo look anything to say d terrific piece of cake Daddy I'm stuck when are you come finished I finished my
