The majority of them have become\ninternally displaced persons, which means they have fled their homes\nbut are still within their own countries. Others have crossed a border and sought\nshelter outside of their own countries. They are commonly referred to as refugees. But what exactly does that term mean? The world has known refugees \nfor millennia, but the modern definition was drafted\nin the UN's 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees in response to mass persecutions\nand displacements of the Second World War. It defines a refugee as someone who is\noutside their country of nationality, and is unable to return \nto their home country because of well-founded fears\nof being persecuted. That persecution may be due to their race,\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,\nor political opinion, and is often related to war and violence. Today, roughly half the world's refugees\nare children, some of them unaccompanied by an adult, a situation that makes them especially\nvulnerable to child labor or sexual exploitation. Each refugee's story is different, and many must undergo dangerous\njourneys with uncertain outcomes. But before we get \nto what their journeys involve, let's clear one thing up. There's a lot of confusion regarding\nthe difference between the terms \"migrant\" and \"refugee.\" \"Migrants\" usually refers to people \nwho leave their country for reasons not related to persecution, such as searching \nfor better economic opportunities or leaving drought-stricken areas\nin search of better circumstances. There are many people around the world\nwho have been displaced because of natural disasters, food insecurities, and other hardships, but international law, rightly or wrongly, only recognizes those fleeing\nconflict and violence as refugees. So what happens when someone\nflees their country? Most refugee journeys \nare long and perilous with limited access to shelter,\nwater, or food. Since the departure can be sudden\nand unexpected, belongings might be left behind, and people who are evading conflict\noften do not have the required documents, like visas, to board airplanes\nand legally enter other countries. Financial and political factors can also\nprevent them from traveling by standard routes. This means they can usually only travel\nby land or sea, and may need to entrust their lives\nto smugglers to help them cross borders. Whereas some people seek safety\nwith their families, others attempt passage alone\nand leave their loved ones behind with the hopes of being reunited later. This separation can be traumatic\nand unbearably long. While more than half the world's refugees\nare in cities, sometimes the first stop for a person\nfleeing conflict is a refugee camp, usually run by the United Nations\nRefugee Agency or local governments. Refugee camps are intended \nto be temporary structures, offering short-term shelter until \ninhabitants can safely return home, be integrated to the host country, or resettle in another country. But resettlement and long-term \nintegration options are often limited. So many refugees are left with no choice\nbut to remain in camps for years and sometimes even decades. Once in a new country, the first legal\nstep for a displaced person is to apply for asylum. At this point, they are an asylum seeker and not officially recognized as a refugee\nuntil the application has been accepted. While countries by and large agree\non one definition of refugee, every host country is responsible\nfor examining all requests for asylum and deciding whether applicants can be\ngranted the status of refugee. Different countries guidelines \ncan vary substantially. Host countries have several duties towards people they have \nrecognized as refugees, like the guarantee of a minimum standard\nof treatment and non-discrimination. The most basic obligation towards refugees\nis non-refoulement, a principle preventing a nation from\nsending an individual to a country where their life and freedom\nare threatened. In reality, however, refugees are\nfrequently the victims of inconsistent \nand discriminatory treatment. They're increasingly obliged to rebuild\ntheir lives in the face of xenophobia and racism. And all too often, they aren't permitted\nto enter the work force and are fully dependent \non humanitarian aid. In addition, far too many refugee children\nare out of school due to lack of funding \nfor education programs. If you go back in your own family history, chances are you will discover that\nat a certain point, your ancestors were forced \nfrom their homes, either escaping a war\nor fleeing discrimination and persecution. It would be good of us to remember\ntheir stories when we hear of refugees \ncurrently displaced, searching for a new home."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Worldwide, approximately how many people have been forced to leave their homes to escape violence and war?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100 million"}, {"label": "B", "text": "60 million"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20 million"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5 million"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the difference between refugees and internally displaced persons (IDP)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Internally displaced persons cross an international border and seek refuge outside of their countries of nationality, while refugees do not"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Refugees cross an international border and seek refuge outside of their countries of nationality while internally displaced persons do not"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Internally displaced persons are legally protected by the UN 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees while refugees are not"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Refugees are legally protected by the UN 1951 Convention on Asylum Seekers while internally displaced persons are not"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to the international legal definition, a refugee is someone who:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Is fleeing war, violence and/or persecution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Is fleeing a large scale natural disaster"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Is fleeing poverty"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "An Asylum seeker is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Another word for refugee"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Another word for internally displaced person"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Someone who is seeking to be recognized by a host country as a refugee"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Someone who is seeking to be recognized by a host country as an internally displaced person"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Host countries have several obligations towards refugees, such as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Non-refoulement"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Non-discrimination"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Recognizing and protecting basic human rights and freedom"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Is it just anything that stores\nand communicates information? Or does it have to do with paper, binding, font, ink,\nits weight in your hands, the smell of the pages? Is this a book? Probably not. But is this? To answer these questions, we need to go back to the start\nof the book as we know it and understand how these elements\ncame together to make something more than the sum of their parts. The earliest object that we think\nof as a book is the codex: a stack of pages bound along one edge. But the real turning point in book history was Johannes Gutenberg's\nprinting press in the mid-15th century. The concept of moveable type had been\ninvented much earlier in Eastern culture, but the introduction of Gutenberg's\npress had a profound effect. Suddenly, an elite class of monks\nand the ruling class no longer controlled \nthe production of texts. Messages could spread more easily, and copies could constantly be produced, so printing houses popped\nup all over Europe. The product of this bibliographic boom\nis familiar to us in some respects, but markedly different in others. The skeleton of the book is paper,\ntype, and cover. More than 2,000 years ago,\nChina invented paper as a writing surface, which was itself predated \nby Egyptian papyrus. However, until the 16th century, Europeans mainly wrote \non thin sheets of wood and durable parchment\nmade of stretched animal skins. Eventually, the popularity of paper\nspread throughout Europe, replacing parchment for most printings\nbecause it was less expensive in bulk. Inks had been made by combining\norganic plant and animal dyes with water or wine, but since water doesn't stick\nto metal type, use of the printing press required\na change to oil-based ink. Printers used black ink made of\na mixture of lamp soot, turpentine, and walnut oil. And what about font size and type? The earliest movable type pieces\nconsisted of reversed letters cast in relief on the ends\nof lead alloy stocks. They were handmade and expensive, and the designs were as different\nas the people who carved their molds. Standardization was not really possible\nuntil mass manufacturing and the creation of an accessible\nword processing system. As for style, we can thank Nicolas Jenson\nfor developing two types of Roman font that led to thousands of others, including the familiar Times Roman. Something had to hold all this together, and until the late 15th century, covers consisted of either wood, or sheets of paper pasted together. These would eventually be replaced\nby rope fiber millboard, originally intended for high quality\nbindings in the late 17th century, but later as a less expensive option. And while today's mass produced\ncover illustrations are marketing tools, the cover designs of early books \nwere made to order. Even spines have a history. Initially, they were not considered\naesthetically important, and the earliest ones were flat,\nrather than rounded. The flat form made the books\neasier to read by allowing the book to rest easily\non a table. But those spines were damaged\neasily from the stresses of normal use. A rounded form solved that issue, although new problems arose, like having the book close\nin on itself. But flexibility was more important, especially for the on-the-go reader. As the book evolves\nand we replace bound texts with flat screens and electronic ink, are these objects and files really books? Does the feel of the cover or the smell of the paper add something\ncrucial to the experience? Or does the magic live only\nwithin the words, no matter what their presentation?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is a codex?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A series of unique characters only understood by societal members"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A close ancestor to what we think we know as the form of the book"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A collection of pictures"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Software that contains a secret code"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who invented the printing press?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Johannes Gutenberg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nicolas Jenson"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Aldus Manutius"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Johann Fust"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the evolution of book covers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Millboard has always been used"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pasteboard→wood→millboard"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pasteboard does not exist"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wood→pasteboard→millboard"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Once the printing press existed, would water-based ink work in the printing process?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes, absolutely"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Yes, with restrictions"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is a book?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A set of tickets, blanks sheets for notes, checks, etc. bound together"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An electronic text such as an iPad or Kin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A bound set of pages that are glued or sewn together to one side"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

the most important and enchanting life skills anyone can have yet few of us know how to do it not because we're evil but because no one has taught us how and a related point no one has listened to us so we come to social life greedy to speak rather than listen hungry to meet others but reluctant to hear them friendship degenerates into a socialized egoism like most things it's about education our civilization is full of great books on how to speak Cicero's orator and Aristotle's rhetoric were two of the greatest in the ancient world but sadly no one has ever written a book called The Listener there are range of things that the good listener is doing that makes it so nice to spend time in their company firstly they egg us on it's hard to know our own minds often we're in the vicinity of something but we don't quite close in on what's really bothering or exciting us we hugely benefit from encouragement to elaborate to go into greater detail to push just a little further we need someone who rather than launch forth on their own will simply say those two magic words go on you mention a sibling and they want to know a bit more what was the relationship like in childhood how's it changed over time they're curious where our concerns and excitements come from they ask things like why did that particularly bother you why was that such a big thing for you they keep our histories in mind they might refer back to something we said before and we feel they're building up a deeper base of Engagement secondly the good listener urges clarification it's fatally easy to say vague things we simply mention that something is lovely or terrible nice or annoying but we don't really explore why we feel this way the friend who listens often has a productive friendly suspicion of some of our own first statements and is after the deeper attitudes that are lurking in the background they take things we say like I'm fed up with my job or my partner and I having a lot of row and they help us to focus in on what it really is about the job we don't like or what the rouss are really about they're bringing to listening an ambition to clarify the underlying issues they don't just see conversation as the swapping of anecdotes they're reconnecting the chat you're having over Pizza with the philosophical Ambitions of Socrates whose dialogues are records of his attempts to help fellow Athenians understand their ideas and values in a better way thirdly good listeners don't moralize the good listener is acutely aware of how insane we all are they know their own minds well enough not to be surprised or frightened about this they're skilled at making occasional little positive sounds strategic M that delicately signal sympathy without intruding on what we're trying to say they give the impression that they recognize and accept our folies they're reassuring us they're not going to shred our dignity a big worry in a competitive world is that we feel we can't afford to be honest about how distressed we are saying one feels like a failure could mean being dropped but the good listener signals early and clearly that they don't see us in these terms our vulnerability is something they warm to rather than a rep ped by lastly good listeners separate disagreement from criticism there's a huge tendency to feel that being disagreed with is an expression of hostility and obviously sometimes that's right but a good listener makes it clear that they can really like you and at the same time think you're wrong they make it plain that their liking for you isn't dependent on constant agreement they're powerfully aware that A really lovely person could end up a bit muddled and and in need of some gentle untangling when we're in the company of people who listen well we experience a very powerful pleasure but too often we don't really realize what it is that this person's doing that's so nice by paying strategic attention to the pleasure we can learn to magnify it and offer it to others who will notice hear and repay the favor in turn listening deserves Discovery as one of the keys to a good Society through life thinking that there's a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things and uh there isn't a whole lot of room for subjectivity from my perspective troubles around communicating our intentions and emotions clearly and honestly

We usually imagine these \nmicroscopic organisms, or microbes, as asocial cells that float around\nby themselves. But in reality, \nmicrobes gather by the millions to form vast communities \nknown as biofilms. Natural biofilms are like \nminiature jungles filled with many kinds of microbes\nfrom across the web of life. Bacteria and archaea mingle with\nother microbes like algae, fungi, and protozoa, forming dense, organized structures\nthat grow on almost any surface. When you pad across a river bottom, touch the rind of an aged cheese, tend your garden soil, or brush your teeth, you're coming into contact with these\ninvisible ecosystems. To see how biofilms come about, let's watch one as it develops\non a submerged river rock. This type of biofilm might begin\nwith a few bacteria swimming through their liquid environment. The cells use rotating flagella\nto propel towards the surface of the rock, which they attach to with the help\nof sticky appendages. Then, they start producing an\nextracellular matrix that holds them together as they divide\nand reproduce. Before long, microcolonies arise, clusters of cells sheathed in this slimy,\nglue-like material. Microcolonies grow to become towers, while water channels flow around them, functioning like a basic \ncirculatory system. But why do microbes build \nsuch complex communities when they could live alone? For one thing, microbes \nliving in a biofilm are rooted in a relatively \nstable microenvironment where they may have access \nto a nutrient source. There's also safety in numbers. Out in the deep, dark wilderness\nof the microbial world, isolated microbes face serious risks. Predators want to eat them, immune systems seek to destroy them, and there are physical dangers, too, like running out of water\nand drying up. However, in a biofilm, \nthe extracellular matrix shields microbes from external threats. Biofilms also enable interactions\nbetween individual cells. When microbes are packed against \neach other in close proximity, they can communicate, exchange genetic information, and engage in cooperative\nand competitive social behaviors. Take the soil in your garden, home to thousands of bacterial species. As one species colonizes a plant root, its individual cells might differentiate\ninto various subpopulations, each carrying out a specific task. Matrix producers pump out \nthe extracellular goo, swimmers assemble flagella\nand are free to move about or migrate, and spore-formers produce dormant,\ntough endospores that survive starvation, temperature extremes, and harmful radiation. This phenomenon is called \ndivision of labor. Ultimately, it gives rise to \na sophisticated system of cooperation that's somewhat like \na multicellular organism in itself. But because biofilms often contain\nmany different microbes that aren't closely related to each other, interactions can also be competitive. Bacteria launch vicious attacks \non their competitors by secreting chemicals \ninto the environment, or by deploying molecular spears\nto inject nearby cells with toxins that literally blow them up. In the end, competition \nis all about resources. If one species eliminates another, it keeps more space and food for itself. Although this dramatic life cycle\noccurs beyond the limits of our vision, microbial communities provide humans\nand other species with tangible, and sometimes even delicious, benefits. Microbes make up a major fraction\nof the biomass on Earth and play a critical role \nwithin the global ecosystem that supports all larger organisms, including us. They produce much of the oxygen we breath, and are recruited to clean up\nenvironmental pollution, like oil spills, or to treat our waste water. Not to mention, biofilms are normal\nand flavor enhancing parts of many of the foods we enjoy, including cheese, salami, and kombucha. So the next time you brush your teeth, bite into that cheese rind, sift through garden soil, or skip a river stone, look as close as you can.

It provided a way for the people to alter\nthe constitution itself. And yet, of the nearly 11,000 amendments\nproposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. So what is it that makes the Constitution\nso hard to change? In short, its creators. The founders of the United States\nwere trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies, which needed assurance that their \nagreements couldn't be easily undone. So here's what they decided. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive \na two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress, or a request from two-thirds \nof state legislatures to call a national convention, and that's just the first step. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified\nby three-quarters of all states. To do this, each state can either have\nits legislature vote on the amendment, or it can hold a separate \nratification convention with delegates elected by voters. The result of such high thresholds is that, today, \nthe American Constitution is quite static. Most other democracies pass amendments\nevery couple of years. The U.S., on the other hand, \nhasn't passed one since 1992. At this point, you may wonder how any\namendments managed to pass at all. The first ten, \nknown as the Bill of Rights, includes some of America's \nmost well-known freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, and the right to a fair trial. These were passed all at once to resolve some conflicts from \nthe original Constitutional Convention. Years later, the Thirteenth Amendment,\nwhich abolished slavery, as well as the Fourteenth \nand Fifteenth Amendments, only passed after a bloody civil war. Ratifying amendments \nhas also become harder as the country has grown larger\nand more diverse. The first ever proposed amendment, a formula to assign \ncongressional representatives, was on the verge of ratification\nin the 1790s. However, as more and more states\njoined the union, the number needed to reach \nthe three-quarter mark increased as well, leaving it unratified to this day. Today, there are many \nsuggested amendments, including outlawing \nthe burning of the flag, limiting congressional terms, or even repealing the Second Amendment. While many enjoy strong support,\ntheir likelihood of passing is slim. Americans today are the most politically\npolarized since the Civil War, making it nearly impossible to reach\na broad consensus. In fact, the late Supreme Court Justice\nAntonin Scalia once calculated that due to America's\nrepresentative system of government, it could take as little as 2% of the total\npopulation to block an amendment. Of course, the simplest solution would be\nto make the Constitution easier to amend by lowering the thresholds required\nfor proposal and ratification. That, however, would require \nits own amendment. Instead, historical progress has mainly\ncome from the U.S. Supreme Court, which has expanded its interpretation\nof existing constitutional laws to keep up with the times. Considering that Supreme Court justices\nare unelected and serve for life once appointed, this is far from \nthe most democratic option. Interestingly, the founders themselves\nmay have foreseen this problem early on. In a letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson wrote \nthat laws should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed\nor repealed since every political process \nis full of obstacles that distort the will of the people. Although he believed that the basic principles \nof the Constitution would endure, he stressed that the Earth belongs\nto the living, and not to the dead."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "As described in the Constitution, there are _____ different ways to propose an amendment and _____ different ways to ratify an amendment", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2,2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3,3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4,4"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5,5"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Regardless of the method used, passing a constitutional amendment requires the _____ government to propose the amendment and the _______ government to ratify the amendment.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "State, Federal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Federal, State"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Unitary, Federal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Federal, Confederate"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "To propose an amendment requires a _______ majority.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Simple"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Two-thirds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Four-fifths"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Three-quarters"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who said, \"The earth should belong to the living\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "George Washington"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Alexander Hamilton"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ben Franklin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "James Madison"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Thomas Jefferson"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

He tells us why\nlife is hard, and how to cope. His own life incurred a lot of anxiety. Sigmund\nSchlomo Freud was born to a middle-class Jewish family in 1856. His professional life was not an immediate\nsuccess. As a medical student, he dissected hundreds of eels in an unsuccessful attempt\nto locate their reproductive organs. He promoted cocaine as a medical drug, but\nit turned out to be a dangerous and addictive idea. A few years later he founded the discipline\nthat would ultimately make his name. A new psychological medicine he called PSYCHOANALYSIS The landmark study was his 1900 book The Interpretation\nof Dreams. Many others followed. Despite his success, he was often unhappy. During some particularly strenuous research\nhe recorded, “The chief patient I am preoccupied with is myself…” He was convinced he would\ndie between 61 and 62 and had great phobias about those numbers. (Although he actually\ndied much later, at age 83.) Perhaps because of his frustrations, Freud\nachieved a series of deep insights into the sources of human unhappiness. He proposed that we are all driven by the: Pleasure Principle which inclines us towards easy physical and\nemotional rewards: and away from unpleasant things like drudgery\nand discipline. As infants we are guided more or less solely according to the pleasure principle,\nFreud argued. But it will, if adhered to without constraints,\nlead us to dangerous reckless things: like never doing any work\neating too much or, most notoriously, sleeping with members\nof own family. We need to adjust to what Freud called THE REALITY PRINCIPLE Though we all have to bow to this reality\nprinciple, Freud believed that there were better and worse kinds of adaptations. He\ncalled the troublesome ones NEUROSES Neuroses are the result of faulty negotiations\nwith –or in Freud’s language, repression of–the pleasure principle. Freud described a conflict between three parts\nof our minds: the ID driven by the pleasure principle, and the THE SUPEREGO driven by a desire to follow the rules and\ndo the right thing according to society. and the EGO which has to somehow accomodate the two. To understand more about these dynamics, Freud\nurged us to think back to the origins of our neuroses in childhood. As we grow up, we go through what Freud termed: THE ORAL PHASE where we deal with all the feelings around\ningestion and eating. If our parents aren’t careful we might pick\nup all kinds of neuroses here: we might take pleasure in refusing food, or turn to food\nto calm ourselves down, or hate the idea of depending on anyone else for food. Then comes THE ANAL PHASE which is closely aligned with what we now\ncall “potty-training”. During this period, our parents tell us what\nto do--and when to go. At this phase we begin to learn about testing the limits of authority. Again, if things go wrong, if we don’t feel\nauthority is benign enough, we might, for example, choose to withhold out of defiance. Then, as adults, we might become “anally\nretentive”; in other words, not able to give or surrender. Next comes: THE PHALLIC PHASE which goes until about age 6. Freud shocked\nhis contemporaries by insisting that little children have sexual feelings. Moreover, in\nthe phallic phase children direct their sexual impulses towards their parents, the most immediately\navailable and gratifying people around. Freud famously described what he called THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX Where we are unconsciously predisposed towards “being in love with the one parent and hating the other.” What is complex is that no matter how much\nour parents love us, they cannot extend this to sexual life and will always have another\nlife with a partner. This makes our young selves feel dangerously jealous and angry\n– and also ashamed and guilty about this anger. The complex provides a huge amount\nof internalised worry for a small child. Ultimately, most of us experience some form of confusion around our parents that later ties into our ideas of love. Mum and dad may both give us love, but they\noften mix it in with disturbed behaviour. Yet because we love them, we remain loyal\nto them and also to their bizarre, destructive patterns. For example, if our mother is cold,\nwe will be apt nevertheless to long for her. And as a result, however, we may be prone\nto always associate love with a certain distance. Naturally, the result is very difficult adult\nrelationships. Often the kind of love we’ve learned from mum and dad means we can’t\nfuse sex and love because the people we learnt about love from are also those we were blocked\nfrom having sex with. We might find that the more in love with someone we are, the harder\nit becomes to make love to them. This can reach a pitch of crisis after a few years\nof marriage and some kids. Freud compared the issues we so often have\nwith intimacy to hedgehogs in the winter: they need to cuddle for warmth, but they also\ncan’t come too close because they’re prickly. There’s no easy solution. Freud says we\ncan’t make ourselves fully rational, and we can’t change society, either. In his\n1930 book Civilisation and its Discontents, Freud wrote that society provides us with\nmany things, but it does this by imposing heavy dictates on us: insisting that we sleep\nwith only a few (usually one) other, imposing the incest taboo, requiring us to put off\nour immediate desires, demanding that we follow authority and work to make money. Societies\nthemselves are neurotic–that is how they function - and it’s why there are constant\nwars and other troubles. Freud attempted to invent a treatment for\nour many neuroses: psychoanalysis. He thought that with a little proper analysis, people\ncould uncover what ails them and better adjust to the difficulties of reality. In his sessions he analysed a number of key\nthings. He looked at people’s dreams, which he saw as expressions of WISH FULFILLMENTS He also looked at PARAPRAXES or slips of the tongue. We now call these revealing mistakes FREUDIAN SLIPS Like when we write ‘thigh’ when we wanted\nto write ‘though’. He also liked to think about jokes. He believed\nthat jokes often help us make fun of something symbolic like death or marriage, and thus\nrelieve some of our anxiety about these topics. There’s a temptation to say Freud just made\neverything up, and life isn’t quite so hard as he makes it out to be. But then one morning\nwe find ourselves filled with inexplicable anger towards our partner, or running high\nwith unrelenting anxiety on the train to work, and we’re reminded all over again just how\nelusive, difficult, and Freudian our mental workings actually are. We could still reject his work, of course.\nBut as Freud said, “No one who disdains the key will ever be able to unlock the door.” We could all use a bit more of Freud’s ideas to help us unpick ourselves."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "According to Freud, we are governed by our struggle to balance the pleasure principle and the reality principle.

Even his wardrobe and accessories\nare iconic: the Inverness cape, deerstalker hat, and calabash pipe, and figures such as his best friend\nand housemate Doctor Watson, arch-nemesis Moriarty, and housekeeper Mrs. Hudson have become part of the popular\nconsciousness, as have his extraordinary,\ninfallible powers of deduction utilized in the name of the law, his notorious drug use, and his popular catchphrase,\n\"Elementary, my dear Watson.\" And yet many of these most recognizable\nfeatures of Holmes don't appear in Arthur Conan Doyle's\noriginal stories. Doyle's great detective solves\ncrimes in all sorts of ways, not just using deduction. He speculates, and at times even guesses,\nand regularly makes false assumptions. Furthermore, Mrs. Hudson \nis barely mentioned, no one says, \"Elementary, my dear Watson,\" and the detective and his sidekick\nlive apart for much of the time. Moriarty, the grand villain, \nonly appears in two stories, the detective's drug use is infrequent\nafter the first two novels, and Holmes is rarely enthralled\nto the English legal system; He much prefers enacting his own form\nof natural justice to sticking to the letter of the law. Finally, many of the most iconic elements\nof the Holmesian legend aren't Doyle's either. The deerstalker cap and cape\nwere first imagined by Sidney Paget, the story's initial illustrator. the curved pipe was chosen by\nAmerican actor William Gillette so that audiences could more clearly see\nhis face on stage, and the phrase, \n\"Elementary, my dear Watson,\" was coined by author and humorist\nP.G. Wodehouse. So who exactly is Sherlock Holmes? Who's the real great detective,\nand where do we find him? Purists might answer \nthat the original Sherlock inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's \nuniversity mentor Dr. Joseph Bell is the real one. But the fact remains that that version\nof Sherlock has been largely eclipsed by the sheer volume of interpretation, leaving Doyle's detective \nlargely unrecognizable. So there's another, more complex, but perhaps more satisfying\nanswer to the question, but to get there, we must first consider\nthe vast body of interpretations of the great detective. Since Conan Doyle's first story in 1887, there have been thousands \nof adaptations of Holmes, making him perhaps the most adapted\nfictional character in the world. That process began with Victorian\nstage adaptations, and accelerated \nwith the emergence of film. There were more than 100 film adaptations\nof Holmes in the first two decades \nof the 20th century alone. And since then, there have many thousands\nmore in print, and on film, television, stage, and radio. Holmes has been reinterpreted\nby people everywhere, in remarkably different,\nand often contradictory ways. These adaptations demonstrate\nboth Holmes's popularity and his malleability. For instance, he featured in a number\nof allied anti-Nazi propaganda films during World War II. And both Winston Churchill\nand Franklin Delano Roosevelt were avid enthusiasts, the latter even joining \nthe Baker Street Irregulars, a Holmesian appreciation society, and nicknaming one secret service\nhideout Baker Street. And yet, at the very same time, Holmes also appeared in various\nGerman-language film adaptations, some of which were said to have been\nmuch-loved favorites of Adolf Hitler. So let's return to our question. Would the real Sherlock Holmes\nplease stand up? The truth is that this world of adaptation\nhas made him into a palimpsest. Sherlock is a cultural text, repeatedly altered over time as each new\ninterpretation becomes superimposed over those that proceed it. This means that Sherlock \ncontinually evolves, embodying ideas and values \noften far removed from those found in Conan Doyle. And after each particular story ends,\nSherlock rises again, a little changed, perhaps, with a new face and fresh mannerisms\nor turns of phrase, but still essentially Sherlock,\nour Sherlock."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was Sherlock Holmes’ occupation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Doctor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Scientist"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Detective"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Teacher"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who was Sherlock Holmes’s best friend and working partner?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mrs. Hudson"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dr. Watson"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lestrade"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Moriarty"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What century did the fictional Sherlock Holmes first live in?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "21st"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20th"}, {"label": "C", "text": "19th"}, {"label": "D", "text": "18th"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who is Sherlock Holmes’s arch enemy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Green Goblin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Joker"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Moriarty"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Hooded Claw"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What musical instrument does Sherlock Holmes play?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Piano"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Guitar"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Violin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Banjo"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Can an artificial machine really think? Does the mind just consist of neurons\nin the brain, or is there some intangible spark\nat its core? For many, these have been\nvital considerations for the future of artificial intelligence. But British computer scientist Alan Turing\ndecided to disregard all these questions in favor of a much simpler one: can a computer talk like a human? This question led to an idea for measuring\naritificial intelligence that would famously come to be known\nas the Turing test. In the 1950 paper, \"Computing Machinery\nand Intelligence,\" Turing proposed the following game. A human judge has a text conversation\nwith unseen players and evaluates their responses. To pass the test, a computer must\nbe able to replace one of the players without substantially \nchanging the results. In other words, a computer would be\nconsidered intelligent if its conversation couldn't be easily\ndistinguished from a human's. Turing predicted that by the year 2000, machines with 100 megabytes of memory\nwould be able to easily pass his test. But he may have jumped the gun. Even though today's computers\nhave far more memory than that, few have succeeded, and those that have done well focused more on finding clever ways\nto fool judges than using overwhelming computing power. Though it was never subjected\nto a real test, the first program with \nsome claim to success was called ELIZA. With only a fairly short \nand simple script, it managed to mislead many people\nby mimicking a psychologist, encouraging them to talk more and reflecting their own questions\nback at them. Another early script PARRY\ntook the opposite approach by imitating a paranoid schizophrenic who kept steering the conversation\nback to his own preprogrammed obsessions. Their success in fooling people\nhighlighted one weakness of the test. Humans regularly attribute intelligence\nto a whole range of things that are not actually intelligent. Nonetheless, annual competitions\nlike the Loebner Prize, have made the test more formal with judges knowing ahead of time that some of their conversation partners \nare machines. But while the quality has improved, many chatbot programmers have used\nsimilar strategies to ELIZA and PARRY. 1997's winner Catherine could carry on amazingly focused \nand intelligent conversation, but mostly if the judge wanted\nto talk about Bill Clinton. And the more recent winner\nEugene Goostman was given the persona\nof a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, so judges interpreted its nonsequiturs\nand awkward grammar as language and culture barriers. Meanwhile, other programs like Cleverbot\nhave taken a different approach by statistically analyzing huge databases\nof real conversations to determine the best responses. Some also store memories \nof previous conversations in order to improve over time. But while Cleverbot's individual responses\ncan sound incredibly human, its lack of a consistent personality and inability to deal \nwith brand new topics are a dead giveaway. Who in Turing's day could have predicted\nthat today's computers would be able to pilot spacecraft, perform delicate surgeries, and solve massive equations, but still struggle with \nthe most basic small talk? Human language turns out to be\nan amazingly complex phenomenon that can't be captured by even\nthe largest dictionary. Chatbots can be baffled by simple pauses,\nlike \"umm...\" or questions with no correct answer. And a simple conversational sentence, like, \"I took the juice out of the fridge\nand gave it to him, but forgot to check the date,\" requires a wealth of underlying knowledge\nand intuition to parse. It turns out that simulating \na human conversation takes more than just increasing\nmemory and processing power, and as we get closer to Turing's goal, we may have to deal with all those big\nquestions about consciousness after all."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What does the Turing test directly measure?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "How well a computer program can imitate human conversation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The level of consciousness in a computer program"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A computer program’s memory and processing power"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was the name of the first program claimed to have passed the Turing test?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cleverbot"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ELIZA"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Catherine"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How is the Turing test evaluated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Monitoring the computer’s internal activity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A standardized multiple-choice test"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A human judge"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What strategy was used by Eugene Goostman?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Using a prewritten script"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Repeating judge’s questions back to them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pretending to have limited English skills"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When was the idea of the Turing test first introduced?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1890"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2010"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1950"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Calude", "category": "Linguistics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/does-grammar-matter-andreea-s-calude", "transcript": {"en": "You're telling a friend an amazing story, and you just get to the best part\nwhen suddenly he interrupts, \"The alien and I,\" not \"Me and the alien.\" Most of us would probably be annoyed, but aside from the rude interruption, does your friend have a point? Was your sentence actually \ngrammatically incorrect? And if he still understood it,\nwhy does it even matter? From the point of view of linguistics, grammar is a set of patterns \nfor how words are put together to form phrases or clauses, whether spoken or in writing. Different languages \nhave different patterns. In English, the subject \nnormally comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object, while in Japanese \nand many other languages, the order is subject, object, verb. Some scholars have tried to identify\npatterns common to all languages, but apart from some basic features, like having nouns or verbs, few of these so-called \nlinguistic universals have been found. And while any language needs consistent\npatterns to function, the study of these patterns opens up\nan ongoing debate between two positions known as prescriptivism\nand descriptivism. Grossly simplified, prescriptivists think a given language \nshould follow consistent rules, while descriptivists see variation\nand adaptation as a natural and necessary part of language. For much of history, the vast majority\nof language was spoken. But as people became more interconnected\nand writing gained importance, written language was standardized\nto allow broader communication and ensure that people in different parts\nof a realm could understand each other. In many languages, this standard form\ncame to be considered the only proper one, despite being derived from just one\nof many spoken varieties, usually that of the people in power. Language purists worked to establish\nand propagate this standard by detailing a set of rules that reflected\nthe established grammar of their times. And rules for written grammar were applied\nto spoken language, as well. Speech patterns that deviated from the\nwritten rules were considered corruptions, or signs of low social status, and many people who had grown up\nspeaking in these ways were forced to adopt \nthe standardized form. More recently, however, linguists have understood that speech\nis a separate phenomenon from writing with its own regularities and patterns. Most of us learn to speak at such an early\nage that we don't even remember it. We form our spoken repertoire through\nunconscious habits, not memorized rules. And because speech also uses mood\nand intonation for meaning, its structure is often more flexible, adapting to the needs of speakers\nand listeners. This could mean avoiding complex clauses\nthat are hard to parse in real time, making changes to avoid awkward\npronounciation, or removing sounds to make speech faster. The linguistic approach that tries\nto understand and map such differences without dictating correct ones\nis known as descriptivism. Rather than deciding how language\nshould be used, it describes how people actually use it, and tracks the innovations \nthey come up with in the process. But while the debate between prescriptivism \nand descriptivism continues, the two are not mutually exclusive. At its best, prescriptivism is useful\nfor informing people about the most common established\npatterns at a given point in time. This is important, \nnot only for formal contexts, but it also makes communication easier\nbetween non-native speakers from different backgrounds. Descriptivism, on the other hand, gives us insight into how our minds work and the instinctive ways in which we \nstructure our view of the world. Ultimately, grammar is best thought of\nas a set of linguistic habits that are constantly being negotiated\nand reinvented by the entire group of language users. Like language itself, it's a wonderful and complex fabric woven through the contributions\nof speakers and listeners, writers and readers, prescriptivists and descriptivists, from both near and far."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Grammar can be defined as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A set of rules which a language committee makes up"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A set of patterns for how words are put together"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The correct way in which words should be spelled"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The correct way in which punctuation should be used"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A dialect of a given language may become the standard variety of that language…", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because it is the best and most correct version of that language"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mostly due to coincidental factors, and often due to being spoken by the people in power"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because prescriptivists selected it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because it is the most expressive version of that language"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The spoken version of a language has:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "No grammar of its own; it is merely a collection of corrupted and incorrect utterances"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Its own grammar and regularities, which have evolved to serve the needs of the speakers who use it"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Descriptivism is an approach to examining language which:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Aims to document language mistakes and eliminate them"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Aims to teach people how to write correctly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Aims to document how people actually use language and track innovations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Aims to stop or slow changes in language"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

At base camp, they hunker down for months waiting for the chance to scale \nthe mountain's lofty, lethal peak. But why do people risk life and limb\nto climb Everest? Is it the challenge? The view? The chance to touch the sky? For many, the draw is Everest's status\nas the highest mountain on Earth. There's an important distinction\nto make here. Mauna Kea is actually the tallest\nfrom base to summit, but at 8850 meters above sea level, Everest has the highest altitude \non the planet. To understand how \nthis towering formation was born, we have to peer deep \ninto our planet's crust, where continental plates collide. The Earth's surface \nis like an armadillo's armor. Pieces of crust constantly move over, under, and around each other. For such huge continental plates,\nthe motion is relatively quick. They move two to four \ncentimeters per year, about as fast as fingernails grow. When two plates collide, one pushes into or underneath the other,\nbuckling at the margins, and causing what's known as uplift\nto accomodate the extra crust. That's how Everest came about. 50 million years ago, the Earth's \nIndian Plate drifted north, bumped into the bigger Eurasian Plate, and the crust crumpled,\ncreating huge uplift. Mountain Everest lies at the heart\nof this action, on the edge of the Indian-Eurasian \ncollision zone. But mountains are shaped by forces\nother than uplift. As the land is pushed up, \nair masses are forced to rise as well. Rising air cools, causing any water\nvapor within it to condense and form rain or snow. As that falls, \nit wears down the landscape, dissolving rocks or breaking them down\nin a process known as weathering. Water moving downhill carries\nthe weathered material and erodes the landscape, carving out deep valleys and jagged peaks. This balance between uplift and erosion\ngives a mountain its shape. But compare the celestial peaks\nof the Himalayas to the comforting hills of Appalachia. Clearly, all mountains are not alike. That's because time \ncomes into the equation, too. When continental plates first collide,\nuplift happens fast. The peaks grow tall with steep slopes. Over time, however, gravity and water\nwear them down. Eventually, erosion overtakes uplift, wearing down peaks \nfaster than they're pushed up. A third factor shapes mountains: climate. In subzero temperatures, some snowfall\ndoesn't completely melt away, instead slowly compacting \nuntil it becomes ice. That forms the snowline, which occurs\nat different heights around the planet depending on climate. At the freezing poles,\nthe snowline is at sea level. Near the equator, you have to climb\nfive kilometers before it gets cold enough for ice to form. Gathered ice starts flowing under\nits own immense weight forming a slow-moving frozen river\nknown as a glacier, which grinds the rocks below. The steeper the mountains, \nthe faster ice flows, and the quicker it carves \nthe underlying rock. Glaciers can erode landscapes\nswifter than rain and rivers. Where glaciers cling to mountain peaks,\nthey sand them down so fast, they lop the tops off\nlike giant snowy buzzsaws. So then, how did the icy Mount Everest\ncome to be so tall? The cataclysmic continental clash\nfrom which it arose made it huge to begin with. Secondly, the mountain lies \nnear the tropics, so the snowline is high,\nand the glaciers relatively small, barely big enough to widdle it down. The mountain exists in a perfect storm\nof conditions that maintain its impressive stature. But that won't always be the case. We live in a changing world \nwhere the continental plates, Earth's climate, and the planet's erosive power might one day conspire to cut \nMount Everest down to size.

On each subject, one index finger\nwas covered in the new painkiller while the other remained untouched. Then, both were squeezed\nin painful clamps. The subjects reported that the treated\nfinger hurt less than the untreated one. This shouldn't be surprising, except Trivaricaine wasn't actually\na painkiller, just a fake concotion \nwith no pain-easing properties at all. What made the students so sure\nthis dummy drug had worked? The answer lies in the placebo effect, an unexplained phenomenon wherein drugs, treatments, and therapies\nthat aren't supposed to have an effect, and are often fake, miraculously make people feel better. Doctors have used the term placebo\nsince the 1700s when they realized the power of\nfake drugs to improve people's symptoms. These were administered when proper drugs\nweren't available, or if someone imagined they were ill. In fact, the word placebo\nmeans \"I shall please\" in Latin, hinting at a history of placating\ntroubled patients. Placebos had to mimic the real treatments\nin order to be convincing, so they took the form of sugar pills, water-filled injections, and even sham surgeries. Soon, doctors realized that duping people\nin this way had another use: in clinical trials. By the 1950s, researchers were using\nplacebos as a standard tool to test new treatments. To evaluate a new drug, for instance, half the patients in a trial might receive\nthe real pill. The other half would get a placebo\nthat looked the same. Since patients wouldn't know whether\nthey'd received the real thing or a dud, the results wouldn't be biased, researchers believed. Then, if the new drug showed a significant\nbenefit compared to the placebo, it was proved effective. Nowadays, it's less common to use placebos\nthis way because of ethical concerns. If it's possible to compare a new drug\nagainst an older version, or another existing drug, that's preferable to simply giving\nsomeone no treatment at all, especially if they have a serious ailment. In these cases, placebos are often used\nas a control to fine-tune the trial so that the effects of the new versus\nthe old or alternative drug can be precisely compared. But of course, we know the placebos\nexert their own influence, too. Thanks to the placebo effect, patients have experienced relief \nfrom a range of ailments, including heart problems, asthma, and severe pain, even though all they'd received\nwas a fake drug or sham surgery. We're still trying to understand how. Some believe that instead of being real, the placebo effect is merely confused\nwith other factors, like patients trying to please doctors\nby falsely reporting improvements. On the other hand, researchers think that if a person \nbelieves a fake treatment is real, their expectations of recovery actually\ndo trigger physiological factors that improve their symptoms. Placebos seem to be capable of causing\nmeasurable change in blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of pain-reducing\nchemicals, like endorphins. That explains why subjects in pain studies\noften say placebos ease their discomfort. Placebos may even reduce levels\nof stress hormones, like adrenaline, which can slow the harmful effects\nof an ailment. So shouldn't we celebrate\nthe placebo's bizarre benefits? Not necessarily. If somebody believes a fake treatment\nhas cured them, they may miss out on drugs\nor therapies that are proven to work. Plus, the positive effects \nmay fade over time, and often do. Placebos also cloud clinical results, making scientists even \nmore motivated to discover how they wield such power over us. Despite everything we know about\nthe human body, there are still some strange\nand enduring mysteries, like the placebo effect. So what other undiscovered marvels\nmight we contain?

Some are small and unimportant, but others have a larger impact \non our lives. For example, which politician\nshould I vote for? Should I try the latest diet craze? Or will email make me a millionaire? We're bombarded with so many decisions that it's impossible to make \na perfect choice every time. But there are many ways \nto improve our chances, and one particularly effective technique\nis critical thinking. This is a way of approaching a question that allows us to carefully \ndeconstruct a situation, reveal its hidden issues,\nsuch as bias and manipulation, and make the best decision. If the critical part sounds negative\nthat's because in a way it is. Rather than choosing an answer \nbecause it feels right, a person who uses critical thinking subjects all available options to scrutiny\nand skepticism. Using the tools at their disposal, they'll eliminate everything but the most\nuseful and reliable information. There are many different ways\nof approaching critical thinking, but here's one five-step process that may help you solve \nany number of problems. One: formulate your question. In other words, \nknow what you're looking for. This isn't always as straightforward \nas it sounds. For example, if you're deciding\nwhether to try out the newest diet craze, your reasons for doing so may be obscured\nby other factors, like claims that you'll see results\nin just two weeks. But if you approach the situation with a clear view of what you're \nactually trying to accomplish by dieting, whether that's weight loss, better nutrition, or having more energy, that'll equip you to sift through \nthis information critically, find what you're looking for, and decide whether the new fad\nreally suits your needs. Two: gather your information. There's lots of it out there, so having a clear idea of your question\nwill help you determine what's relevant. If you're trying to decide on a diet\nto improve your nutrition, you may ask an expert for their advice, or seek other people's testimonies. Information gathering helps you\nweigh different options, moving you closer to a decision\nthat meets your goal. Three: apply the information, something you do \nby asking critical questions. Facing a decision, ask yourself,\n\"What concepts are at work?\" \"What assumptions exist?\" \"Is my interpretation of the information\nlogically sound?\" For example, in an email that promises\nyou millions, you should consider, \"What is shaping\nmy approach to this situation?\" \"Do I assume the sender \nis telling the truth?\" \"Based on the evidence, is it logical \nto assume I'll win any money?\" Four: consider the implications. Imagine it's election time, and you've selected a political\ncandidate based on their promise to make it cheaper for drivers\nto fill up on gas. At first glance, that seems great. But what about the long-term \nenvironmental effects? If gasoline use is less \nrestricted by cost, this could also cause a huge\nsurge in air pollution, an unintended consequence \nthat's important to think about. Five: explore other points of view. Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of \nthe opposing political candidate. Even if you disagree with \neverything that candidate says, exploring the full spectrum of viewpoints might explain why some policies that don't\nseem valid to you appeal to others. This will allow you \nto explore alternatives, evaluate your own choices, and ultimately help you make more\ninformed decisions. This five-step process is just one tool, and it certainly won't eradicate difficult\ndecisions from our lives. But it can help us increase \nthe number of positive choices we make. Critical thinking can give us the tools\nto sift through a sea of information and find what we're looking for.

Most Greek city-states surrounded\nthemselves with massive defensive walls for added protection. Sparta in its prime was a different story, finding walls unnecessary when it had an army of the most feared\nwarriors in the ancient world. So what was Sparta doing differently\nthan everyone else to produce such fierce soldiers? To answer that question, we turn to\nthe written accounts of that time. There are no surviving written accounts\nfrom Spartans themselves, as it was forbidden for Spartans\nto keep records, so we have to rely on those of\nnon-Spartan ancient historians, like Herodotus, Thucydides,\nand Plutarch. These stories may be embellished and depict Sparta \nat the apex of its power, so take them with a grain of salt. For Spartans, the purpose for their\nexistence was simple: to serve Sparta. On the day of their birth, elder Spartan leaders examined\nevery newborn. The strong healthy babies were considered\ncapable of fulfilling this purpose, and the others may have been left\non Mount Taygetus to die. Every Spartan, boy or girl,\nwas expected to be physically strong, mentally sharp, and emotionally resilient. And it was their absolute duty\nto defend and promote Sparta at all costs. So in the first years of their lives, children were raised to understand that\ntheir loyalty belonged first to Sparta, and then to family. This mindset probably made it easier\nfor the Spartan boys, who upon turning seven,\nwere sent to the agoge, a place with one main purpose: to turn a boy into a Spartan warrior through thirteen years of relentless,\nharsh, and often brutal training. The Spartans prized physical perfection\nabove all else, and so the students spent a great deal\nof their time learning how to fight. To ensure resilience in battle, boys were encouraged to fight\namong themselves, and bullying, unlike today, \nwas acceptable. In order to better prepare the boys\nfor the conditions of war, the boys were poorly fed, sometimes even going days without eating. They also were given little \nin the way of clothing so that they could learn to deal\nwith different temperatures. Spartan boys were encouraged\nto steal in order to survive, but if they were caught, they would be disciplined, not because they stole,\nbut because they were caught in the act. During the annual contest of endurance in a religious ritual known as\nthe diamastigosis, teenage boys were whipped\nin front of an altar at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia. It was common for boys to die\non the altar of the goddess. Fortunately, not everything\nwas as brutal as that. Young Spartans were also taught\nhow to read, write, and dance, which taught them graceful control\nof their movements and helped them in combat. While the responsibilities for the girls\nof Sparta were different, the high standards of excellence and expectation to serve \nSparta with their lives remained the same. Spartan girls lived at home with\ntheir mothers as they attended school. Their curriculum included the arts, music, dance, reading, and writing. And to stay in peak physical condition,\nthey learned a variety of sports, such as discus, javelin, and horseback riding. In Sparta, it was believed that only\nstrong and capable women could bear children that would one day\nbecome strong and capable warriors. To all Spartans, men and women, perhaps the most important lesson\nfrom Spartan school was allegiance to Sparta. To die for their city-state was seen\nas the completion of one's duty to Sparta. Upon their death, only men who died in battle\nand women who died in childbirth were given tombstones. In the eyes of their countrymen,\nboth died so that Sparta could live."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following Greek historians did not write about ancient Sparta?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Herodotus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Artemis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thucydides"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Plutarch"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "At what age did young Spartan boys get sent to the Agoge?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "13"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The Spartans prized physical perfection above all else.

Successfully adapting to climate change\nis growing increasingly important. For humans, this means using\nour technological advancement to find solutions, like smarter cities\nand better water management. But for some plants and animals, adapting to these global changes\ninvolves the most ancient solution of all: evolution. Evolutionary adaptation usually occurs\nalong time scales of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. But in cases where species are under\nespecially strong selective conditions, like those caused \nby rapidly changing climates, adaptive evolution \ncan happen more quickly. In recent decades, we've seen many plants, animals, and insects relocating themselves and undergoing changes\nto their body sizes, and the dates they flower or breed. But many of these are plastic, or nonheritable changes\nto an individual's physical traits. And there are limits to how much\nan organism can change its own physiology to meet environmental requirements. That's why scientists are seeking\nexamples of evolutionary changes coded in species' DNA that are heritable, long-lasting, and may provide a key to their future. Take the tawny owl. If you were walking through a wintry\nforest in northern Europe 30 years ago, chances are you'd have heard,\nrather than seen, this elusive bird. Against the snowy backdrop, its plumage would have been\nnear impossible to spot. Today, the landscape is vastly different. Since the 1980s, climate change has led to significantly\nless snowfall, but you'd still struggle \nto spot a tawny owl because nowadays, they're brown. The brown color variant is the genetically\ndominant form of plumage in this species, but historically, the recessive pale gray variant triumphed because of its selective advantage\nin helping these predators blend in. However, less snow cover reduces\nopportunities for camouflage, so lately, this gray color variant has been losing \nthe battle against natural selection. The offspring of the brown color morphs,\non the other hand, have an advantage in exposed forests, so brown tawny owls are flourishing today. Several other species have undergone similar climate-change-adaptive \ngenetic changes in recent decades. Pitcher plant mosquitoes \nhave rapidly evolved to take advantage \nof the warmer temperatures, entering dormancy later \nand later in the year. Two spot ladybug populations, once comprised of equal numbers\nof melanic and non-melanic morphs, have now shifted almost entirely\nto the non-melanic color combination. Scientists think that keeps them\nfrom overheating. Meanwhile, pink salmon have adapted\nto warmer waters by spawning earlier in the season\nto protect their sensitive eggs. And wild thyme plants in Europe\nare producing more repellent oils to protect themselves \nagainst the herbivores that become more common when it's warm. These plants and animals belong to a group\nof about 20 identified species with evolutionary adaptations\nto rapid climate change, including snapping turtles, wood frogs, knotweed, and silver spotted skipper butterflies. However, scientists hope to discover\nmore species evolving in response to climate change\nout of 8.7 million species on the planet. For most of our planet's astounding\nand precious biodiversity, evolution won't be the answer. Instead, many of those species\nwill have to rely on us to help them survive a changing world or face extinction. The good news is\nwe already have the tools. Across the planet, we're making\non-the-ground decisions that will help entire ecosystems adapt. Critical climate refuges \nare being identified and set aside, and projects are underway to help\nmobile species move to more suitable climates. Existing parks and protected areas\nare also doing climate change check-ups to help their wildlife cope.

We'd simply be crushed \nby their sheer numbers. There are an estimated 10 quintillion\nindividual insects on Earth. That's a one followed by 19 zeroes. So, compared with our population\nof about 7 billion, these invertebrates outnumber\nus by more than a billion to one. Their astounding numbers exist\nat the species level, as well. There are more than 60,000\nvertebrate species on the planet. But the class of insects contains\na million known species, and many others \nthat haven't been classified. In fact, these critters make up \napproximately 75% of all animals on Earth. So, what's their secret to success? Insect abundance comes down\nto many things that together make them some of the most\nadaptable and resilient creatures, beginning with their impressive \nability to breed. Many species can produce hundreds\nof offspring within their lifetimes. Most offspring will die, but more than enough will survive\ninto adulthood to reproduce. Offspring also mature very rapidly, so the cycle of reproduction\nresumes quickly, and can occur over and over again\nin a short time. These numbers mean that as a class, insects harbor a tremendous amount\nof genetic diversity. The different species contain\na wealth of genetic data that give them the necessary adaptations\nthey need to thrive in a range of environments\nacross the planet. Even some of the most extreme\nenvironments are in bounds; Flat bark beetles can live at\n-40 degrees Fahrenheit, Sahara Desert ants can venture out when surface temperatures exceed\n155 degrees, and some bumblebees can survive\n18,000 feet above sea level. Insect exoskeletons also work\nlike body armor, protecting insects against\nthe outside world and helping them cope with habitats\nthat other creatures can't. Even their small size, which we might see as a disadvantage, is something they use to their benefit. Because most species are so tiny, millions of insects can inhabit\na small space and make use of all the available\nresources within it. This means they can occupy hundreds\nof different niches across ecosystems. Some insects survive by eating the roots, stems, leaves, seeds, pollen, and nectar of specific plants. Others, like wasps, make use of live insects \nby paralyzing the victims and laying their eggs inside so that when the hatchlings emerge, they can eat their way out\nand get nourishment. Mosquitos and biting flies feed on blood, taking advantage of this unusual resource\nto ensure their survival. And a whole bunch of other insects\nhave built a niche around feces. Flies lay their eggs there, and some beetles even build\nlarge balls out of animal dung, which they eat and use as accommodation\nfor their eggs. And then there's the insects' mighty power\nof metamorphosis. This trait not only transforms insects, but also helps them maximize\nthe available resources in an ecosystem. Take butterflies. In their larval caterpillar form, they chomp hungrily through leaves\nat a rapid rate to help them grow and spin cocoons. But when they emerge as butterflies, these insects feed only on flower nectar. Metamorphosis means the larvae\nand adults of one species will never compete for the same resource, so they successfully share \nan ecological niche without limiting their own success. This process is so efficient that an incredible 86% of insect species\nundergo complete metamorphosis. We're big and they're small, so it's easy to forget that these critters\nare moving in their millions all around us, all the time. But examine almost any patch of ground, and you're sure to find them there. Their numbers are immense,\nand their success is unmatched.

And what's even more ironic is that\nthe movement they pioneered, considered revolutionary\nand even scandalous at the time, was inspired largely by an object\nof a traditional and ancient design. As far back as the Renaissance, the primary European art movements\nemphasized conventional representation and adherence to classical forms. But that began to change \nin the late 19th century as artists like Van Gogh and Cézanne\nexpanded the boundaries of painting. Soon, a movement arose that sought\nto create an entirely new style of art, and one way of doing so was to look\nbeyond Western civilization. For example, Paul Gauguin moved\nto the island of Tahiti in the 1890s. There, he found inspiration in the island's\ninhabitants, landscape, and culture to create artwork that intertwined\nEuropean themes and Polynesian lore. Others looked the cultures \nof the Islamic world, but the most influential inspiration\nwould come from Sub-Saharan Africa. As European empires expanded\ndeeper into the African continent, its artifacts and artworks made their way\ninto the hands of museums and collectors. One such collector was Henri Matisse, who showed his friend Picasso \na mask he had acquired made by the Dan tribe of the Ivory Coast. The mask awoke Picasso's curiosity, leading him to visit the Trocadéro \nEthnographic Museum in Paris in 1907. Founded to house acquisitions \nfrom colonial conquests, the museum boasted \na collection of African art, with stylized figures \nand masks made of wood and decorated with simple colors \nand materials. The visit was a revelation for Picasso, who proclaimed that African masks\nwere what painting was all about. At this time, Picasso had been working\non a painting of five nude women in a style that would later come\nto be known as Cubism. And while three of these ladies\nshow facial features found in ancient Iberian art, a nod to Picasso's Spanish heritage, the faces of the two on the right\nclosely resemble African masks. Created in 1907 after hundreds\nof sketches and studies, \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" has been considered \nthe first truly 20th century masterpiece, breaking with many previously \nheld notions in art. It was at once aggressive and abstract, distorted yet primal in its raw geometry, a new artistic language with new forms,\ncolors, and meanings. And these avant-garde qualities\ncaused a sensation when the painting was first exhibited\nalmost ten years later. The public was shocked, critics denounced it as immoral, and even Picasso's own friends\nwere simultaneously surprised, offended, and mesmerized at his audacity. More artists soon followed \nin Picasso's footsteps. Constantin Brâncuși \nand Amedeo Modigliani in Paris, as well as the German Expressionists, all drew on the aesthetics \nof African sculptures in their work. Others looked to a different continent\nfor their inspiration. British sculptor Henry Moore based many\nof his semi-abstract bronze sculptures on a replica of a chacmool, a distinctive reclining statue\nfrom the Toltec-Maya culture. Pre-Columbian art was also a major\ninfluence for Josef Albers. He created a series of compositions, such as the geometrical series\nHomage to the Square, that were inspired by pyramids\nand local art he encountered\non his frequent visits to Mexico. Inspiration from ancient cultures initiated one of the most revolutionary \nmovements in art history, but were these artists playing the role\nof explorers or conquistadors, appropriating ideas and profiting\nfrom cultures they considered primitive? Questions like this deserve scrutiny,\nas artists continue to redefine standards. Perhaps not too long from now, the bold innovations of modern art\nwill seem like stale orthodoxies, ready to be overturned by a new set\nof radical trailblazers drawing inspiration from another\nunlikely source."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many years ago do you think the modern art movement originated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "25"}, {"label": "B", "text": "70"}, {"label": "C", "text": "150"}, {"label": "D", "text": "90"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Name the artist who was a precursor of modern art.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Leonardo da Vinci"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Jackson Pollock"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Michelangelo"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Paul Gauguin"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the title of the painting called the first truly masterpiece of the 20th Century?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Guernica"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Starry Night"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What culture inspired the first modern art masterpiece?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Islamic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "African"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Native American"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Near East"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which artist said “I do not seek, I find”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vincent van Gogh"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Constantin Brancusi"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pablo Picasso"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Amedeo Modigliani"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Cleary", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-we-love-a-philosophical-inquiry-skye-c-cleary", "transcript": {"en": "Ah, romantic love - beautiful and intoxicating, heartbreaking and soul-crushing, often all at the same time. Why do we choose to put ourselves\nthrough its emotional wringer? Does love make our lives meaningful, or is it an escape from our loneliness\nand suffering? Is love a disguise for our sexual desire, or a trick of biology\nto make us procreate? Is it all we need? Do we need it at all? If romantic love has a purpose, neither science nor psychology\nhas discovered it yet. But over the course of history, some of our most respected philosophers\nhave put forward some intriguing theories. Love makes us whole, again. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato explored the idea that we love\nin order to become complete. In his \"Symposium\",\nhe wrote about a dinner party, at which Aristophanes, a comic playwright, regales the guests \nwith the following story: humans were once creatures with four arms,\nfour legs, and two faces. One day, they angered the gods, and Zeus sliced them all in two. Since then, every person has been missing\nhalf of him or herself. Love is the longing to find a soulmate\nwho'll make us feel whole again, or, at least, that's what Plato believed\na drunken comedian would say at a party. Love tricks us into having babies. Much, much later, German philosopher\nArthur Schopenhauer maintained that love \nbased in sexual desire was a voluptuous illusion. He suggested that we love because\nour desires lead us to believe that another person will make us happy,\nbut we are sorely mistaken. Nature is tricking us into procreating, and the loving fusion we seek\nis consummated in our children. When our sexual desires are satisfied, we are thrown back \ninto our tormented existences, and we succeed only in maintaining\nthe species and perpetuating the cycle \nof human drudgery. Sounds like somebody needs a hug. Love is escape from our loneliness. According to the Nobel Prize-winning\nBritish philosopher Bertrand Russell, we love in order to quench\nour physical and psychological desires. Humans are designed to procreate, but without the ecstasy \nof passionate love, sex is unsatisfying. Our fear of the cold, cruel world\ntempts us to build hard shells to protect and isolate ourselves. Love's delight, intimacy, and warmth\nhelps us overcome our fear of the world, escape our lonely shells, and engage more abundantly in life. Love enriches our whole being,\nmaking it the best thing in life. Love is a misleading affliction. Siddhārtha Gautama, who became known as the Buddha,\nor the Enlightened One, probably would have had some interesting\narguments with Russell. Buddha proposed that we love because\nwe are trying to satisfy our base desires. Yet, our passionate cravings are defects, and attachments, even romantic love,\nare a great source of suffering. Luckily, Buddha discovered \nthe eight-fold path, a sort of program for \nextinguishing the fires of desire so that we can reach Nirvana, an enlightened state of peace, clarity,\nwisdom, and compassion. The novelist Cao Xueqin illustrated\nthis Buddhist sentiment that romantic love is folly in \none of China's greatest classical novels, \"Dream of the Red Chamber.\" In a subplot, Jia Rui \nfalls in love with Xi-feng who tricks and humiliates him. Conflicting emotions of love and hate\ntear him apart, so a Taoist gives him a magic mirror\nthat can cure him as long as he doesn't \nlook at the front of it. But of course, \nhe looks at the front of it. He sees Xi-feng. His soul enters the mirror and he is dragged away \nin iron chains to die. Not all Buddhists think this way\nabout romantic and erotic love, but the moral of this story is that such attachments\nspell tragedy, and should, along with magic mirrors,\nbe avoided. Love lets us reach beyond ourselves. Let's end on a slightly \nmore positive note. The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir proposed that love is the desire\nto integrate with another and that it infuses our lives\nwith meaning. However, she was less \nconcerned with why we love and more interested \nin how we can love better. She saw that the problem\nwith traditional romantic love is it can be so captivating, that we are tempted to make it\nour only reason for being. Yet, dependence on another \nto justify our existence easily leads to boredom and power games. To avoid this trap, Beauvoir advised\nloving authentically, which is more like a great friendship. Lovers support each other \nin discovering themselves, reaching beyond themselves, and enriching their lives\nand the world together. Though we might never know\nwhy we fall in love, we can be certain that it will be\nan emotional rollercoaster ride. It's scary and exhilarating. It makes us suffer and makes us soar. Maybe we lose ourselves. Maybe we find ourselves. It might be heartbreaking, or it might just be \nthe best thing in life.

Neighboring countries' monarchs feared\nthey would share the fate of Louis XVI, and attacked the New Republic, while at home, extremism and mistrust\nbetween factions lead to bloodshed. In the midst of all this conflict, a powerful figure emerged \nto take charge of France. But did he save the revolution\nor destroy it? \"Order, order, who's the defendant today?\nI don't see anyone.\" \"Your Honor, this is Napoléon Bonaparte, the tyrant who invaded \nnearly all of Europe to compensate for his personal \nstature-based insecurities.\" \"Actually, Napoléon was \nat least average height for his time. The idea that he was short comes\nonly from British wartime propaganda. And he was no tyrant. He was safeguarding the young Republic\nfrom being crushed by the European monarchies.\" \"By overthrowing its government\nand seizing power himself?\" \"Your Honor, as a young and successful\nmilitary officer, Napoléon fully supported \nthe French Revolution, and its ideals of liberty, equality,\nand fraternity. But the revolutionaries were incapable\nof real leadership. Robespierre and the Jacobins\nwho first came to power unleashed a reign of terror\non the population, with their anti-Catholic extremism and nonstop executions of everyone\nwho disagreed with them. And The Directory that replaced them\nwas an unstable and incompetent oligarchy. They needed a strong leader who could\ngovern wisely and justly.\" \"So, France went through \nthat whole revolution just to end up with \nanother all-powerful ruler?\" \"Not quite. Napoléon's new powers were derived\nfrom the constitution that was approved by a popular vote\nin the Consulate.\" \"Ha! The constitution was practically dictated\nat gunpoint in a military coup, and the public only accepted the tyrant because they were tired \nof constant civil war.\" \"Be that as it may, Napoléon introduced a new constitution\nand a legal code that kept some of the most important\nachievements of the revolution in tact: freedom of religion abolition of hereditary privilege, and equality before the law for all men.\" \"All men, indeed. He deprived women of the rights\nthat the revolution had given them and even reinstated slavery\nin the French colonies. Haiti is still recovering from \nthe consequences centuries later. What kind of equality is that?\" \"The only kind that could be stably\nmaintained at the time, and still far ahead of France's neighbors.\" \"Speaking of neighbors, what was with\nall the invasions?\" \"Great question, Your Honor.\" \"Which invasions are we talking about? It was the neighboring empires\nwho had invaded France trying to restore the monarchy, and prevent the spread of liberty\nacross Europe, twice by the time Napoléon took charge. Having defended France as a soldier\nand a general in those wars, he knew that the best defense\nis a good offense.\" \"An offense against the entire continent? Peace was secured by 1802, and other European powers recognized\nthe new French Regime. But Bonaparte couldn't rest unless \nhe had control of the whole continent, and all he knew was fighting. He tried to enforce a European-wide\nblockade of Britain, invaded any country that didn't comply, and launched more wars \nto hold onto his gains. And what was the result? Millions dead all over the continent, and the whole \ninternational order shattered.\" \"You forgot the other result: the spread of democratic \nand liberal ideals across Europe. It was thanks to Napoléon that\nthe continent was reshaped from a chaotic patchwork of fragmented\nfeudal and religious territories into efficient, modern, \nand secular nation states where the people held more power\nand rights than ever before.\" \"Should we also thank him\nfor the rise of nationalism and the massive increase in army sizes? You can see how well that turned out\na century later.\" \"So what would European history have been\nlike if it weren't for Napoléon?\" \"Unimaginably better/worse.\" Napoléon seemingly unstoppable momentum\nwould die in the Russian winter snows, along with most of his army. But even after being deposed\nand exiled, he refused to give up, escaping from his prison and launching\na bold attempt at restoring his empire before being defeated for the second\nand final time.

{"page": 93, "lesson": 21, "title": "#TEDEdChat: Redefining Leadership | Drew Dudley | Leading with Lollipops |", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/H9LmzVHG", "transcript": {"en": "Transcriber: Joseph Geni\nReviewer: Ivana Korom I want to start by asking everyone\nin the audience a question, how many of you\nare completely comfortable with calling yourselves a leader? I've asked that question\nall the way across the country, and no matter where I ask it, there's always a huge portion\nof the audience that won't put up their hand. And I've come to realize\nthat we have made leadership into something bigger than us. Something beyond us. We've made it about changing the world. And we've taken this title of leader,\nand we treat it as if it's something that one day we're going to deserve, but to give it to ourselves right now means a level of arrogance or cockiness\nthat we're not comfortable with. And I worry sometimes\nthat we spend so much time celebrating amazing things\nthat hardly anybody can do that we've convinced ourselves those are the only things\nworth celebrating, and we start to devalue the things\nthat we can do every day, and we start to take moments\nwhere we truly are a leader and we don't let ourselves\ntake credit for it, and feel good about it. And I've been lucky enough\nover the last 10 years to work with some amazing people who have helped me\nredefine leadership in a way that I think has made me happier. Today, I want to share with you the one story that is probably\nmost responsible for that redefinition. I went to school in a little school called Mount Allison University in Sackville,\nNew Brunswick, and on my last day there,\na girl came up to me and said, \"I remember\nthe first time that I met you.\" And then she told me a story\nthat had happened four years earlier. She said, \"On the day before\nI started university, I was in the hotel room\nwith my mom and dad, and I was so scared\nand so convinced that I couldn't do this, that I wasn't ready for university,\nthat I burst into tears. My mom and dad were amazing.\nThey were like, 'Look, we know you're scared,\nbut let's just go tomorrow. Let's go to the first day,\nand if at any point you feel as if you can't do this, that's fine,\njust tell us, we will take you home. We love you no matter what.'\" She says, \"I went the next day, I was standing in line\ngetting ready for registration, and I looked around\nand I just knew I couldn't do it. I knew I wasn't ready.\nI knew I had to quit.\" She says, \"I made that decision,\nand as soon as I did, this incredible feeling\nof peace came over me. I turned to my mom and dad\nto tell them we needed to go home, and at that moment, you came out\nof the Student Union building wearing the stupidest hat\nI have ever seen in my life.\" (Laughter) \"It was awesome. And you had a big sign\npromoting Shinerama, which is Students Fighting\nCystic Fibrosis,\" - a charity I've worked with for years - \"and you had a bucketful of lollipops. You were walking along\nand handing them out to people in line\nand talking about Shinerama. And all of a sudden, you got to me,\nand you just stopped, and stared. It was creepy.\"\n(Laughter) This girl right here knows exactly\nwhat I'm talking about. (Laughter) \"And then you looked\nat the guy next to me, you smiled, reached in your bucket,\npulled out a lollipop, held it out to him, and you said, 'You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman\nstanding next to you.'\" And she said, \"I have never seen anyone\nget more embarrassed faster in my life. He turned beet red,\nand he wouldn't even look at me. He just kind of held the lollipop out\nlike this.\" (Laughter) \"And I felt so bad for this dude\nthat I took the lollipop, and as soon as I did,\nyou got this incredibly severe look on your face and you looked\nat my mom and dad, and you said, 'Look at that. First day away from home,\nand already she's taking candy from a stranger?!'\" (Laughter) And she said, \"Everybody lost it.\nTwenty feet in every direction, everyone started to howl. I know this is cheesy,\nand I don't know why I'm telling you this, but in that moment\nwhen everyone was laughing, I knew that I shouldn't quit. I knew that I was\nwhere I was supposed to be, I knew that I was home,\nand I haven't spoken to you once in the four years since that day, but I heard that you were leaving, and I had to come up\nand tell you that you've been an incredibly important person in my life,\nand I'm going to miss you. Good luck.\" And she walks away, and I'm flattened. She gets about six feet away,\nturns around and smiles, and goes, \"You should probably know this, too. I'm still dating that guy\nfour years later.\" (Laughter) A year and a half\nafter I moved to Toronto, I got an invitation to their wedding. Here's the kicker. I don't remember that. I have no recollection of that moment, and I've searched my memory banks,\nbecause that is funny and I should remember doing it,\nand I don't remember it. And that was such an eye-opening,\ntransformative moment for me to think that maybe the biggest impact\nI'd ever had on anyone's life, a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say, \"You've been an incredibly\nimportant person in my life,\" was a moment that I didn't even remember. How many of you guys\nhave a lollipop moment, a moment where someone\nsaid something or did something that you feel fundamentally\nmade your life better? All right. How many of you\nhave told that person they did it? See, why not? We celebrate birthdays, where all you have to do\nis not die for 365 days - (Laughter) - and yet we let people\nwho have made our lives better walk around without knowing it. And every single one of you, has been the catalyst\nfor a lollipop moment. You have made someone's life better\nby something that you said or did, and if you think you haven't,\nthink about all the hands that didn't go back up\nwhen I asked that question. You're just one of the people\nwho hasn't been told. But it is so scary to think\nof ourselves as that powerful. It can be frightening to think we can\nmatter that much to other people, because as long as we make leadership\nsomething bigger than us, as long as we keep it\nsomething beyond us, make it about changing the world, we give ourselves\nan excuse not to expect it every day from ourselves\nand from each other. Marianne Williamson said, \"Our greatest fear\nis not that we are inadequate. It is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, and not our darkness,\nthat frightens us.\" My call to action today\nis that we need to get over that. We need to get over our fear\nof how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other's lives. We need to get over it\nso we can move beyond it, and our little brothers and sisters, and our kids right now -\ncan watch and start to value the impact we can have\non each other's lives more than money and power\nand titles and influence. We need to redefine leadership\nas being about lollipop moments, how many of them we create,\nhow many we acknowledge, how many we pay forward,\nand how many we say thank you for. Because we've made leadership\nabout changing the world, and there is no world. There's only six billion\nunderstandings of it, and if you change\none person's understanding of it, one person's understanding\nof what they're capable of, one person's understanding\nof how much people care about them, one person's understanding\nof how powerful an agent for change they can be in this world,\nyou've changed the whole thing.

Swiss cheese its holes? And what makes vinegar so sour? These foods may taste \ncompletely different, but all of these phenomena come from\ntiny organisms chowing down on sugar and belching up some culinary byproducts. Let's start with yeast. Yeast are single-celled fungi \nused to make bread, beer, and wine, among other products. Yeast break down carbohydrates,\nlike sugar, to get energy \nand the molecules they need to function. They have two different ways to do this: the oxygen-dependent, or aerobic, pathway, and the oxygen-independent, \nanaerobic pathway, which is also called fermentation. When you bake bread,\nyeast can use both pathways, but they normally prefer to start with\nthe anaerobic process of fermentation. In this process, ethanol is produced\nin addition to CO2. No, bread isn't alcoholic. Small amounts of alcohol that are secreted\nevaporate during baking. In the aerobic, \nor oxygen-dependent pathway, the yeast consume some of the sugar and produce carbon dioxide gas,\nor CO2, and water. In both processes, the CO2 accumulates\nand creates tiny bubbles. These bubbles get trapped by gluten\nand create a sponge-like structure that gives the bread its soft texture. Wine also relies on yeast. But a wine-making set-up \nkeeps the oxygen levels low so that yeast consume sugar \nusing fermentation, the anaerobic pathway. The process often starts with wild yeasts\nalready hanging out on the grapes. But to get consistent results, most winemakers also add \ncarefully selected strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol. The yeast consume the sugar\nin the grape juice, and as the sugar level drops, the alcohol level rises. This doesn't necessarily mean \nthat sweeter wines have less alcohol. Different types of grapes start with\ndifferent amounts of sugar, and sugar can also be added. What happens to the carbon dioxide? It just bubbles away through a vent. In carbonated alcoholic beverages,\nlike champagne and beer, sealed containers are used in primary\nor secondary fermentation to keep the carbon dioxide in the bottle. Wine also introduces us to our second\ntype of food-producing microorganism: bacteria. A special strain of bacteria turns a tart compound in grape juice\ninto softer tasting ones that are responsible for some of\nthe flavors in red wines and chardonnays. Another type of bacteria,\ncalled acetic acid bacteria, isn't so desirable in wine, but they have their function, too. If there's oxygen around, these bacteria convert the ethanol in wine\ninto, well, acetic acid. Let this process continue\nand you'll eventually get vinegar. Bacteria are the key for cheese, too. To make cheese, \nmilk is inoculated with bacteria. The bacteria gobble up the lactose,\na kind of sugar, and produce lactic acid,\nalong with many other chemicals. As the milk gets more and more acidic, its proteins start to aggregate \nand curdle. That's why spoiled milk is clumpy. Cheesemakers usually add an enzyme\ncalled rennet, naturally found inside of cows, goats,\nand some other mammals to help this process along. Eventually, those little curdles turn into\nbigger curds, which are pressed \nto squeeze out the water, and create a firm cheese. Different strains of bacteria\nmake different kinds of cheese. For example, a species of bacteria\nthat emits carbon dioxide is what gives swiss cheese\nits characteristic holes. Some cheeses, brie and camembert,\nuse another kind of microorganism, too: mold. So your kitchen functions as a sort of\nbiotechnology lab manned by microorganisms \nthat culture your cuisine. Yogurt, soy sauce, sour cream, sauerkraut, kefir, kimchi, kombucha, \ncheddar, challah, pita, and naan. But maybe not all at the same dinner."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In which of the described dishes is yeast not being used?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Swiss cheese"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Wine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bread"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Beer"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why is bread soft and airy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bacteria secreting lactic acid is breaking up the gluten"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yeast is secreting alcohol and dissolving the gluten"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Yeast is secreting CO2 causing bubbles in the dough"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Bacteria is eating up some of the gluten"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why are the food types described in the video considered biotechnological applications?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They were developed and refined by biotechnological corporations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are products made using biological processes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are food made by technology"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are not really biotechnological applications"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the described compounds is required for cheese making?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Alcohol"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lactic acid"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gluten"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these foods can also be added to the video?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cakes because of the baking soda releasing CO2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yogurt made by adding hydrochloric acid to milk"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pickles made using bacteria secreting lactic acid"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Jam made by cooking fruits"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
