One day, their vigorous game disturbed\nthe lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match. But when the brothers arrived, \nthe lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head \nfrom a tree as a trophy. The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention \nof one of the lords’ daughters. When she reached for it, \nthe skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her. Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law\nand gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke. The second generation of twins discovered \ntheir father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, \nand began to play. Soon enough, the messengers \nfrom the underworld arrived to issue another challenge. Knowing what had happened\nto their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled \nwith scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld\ncontrolled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans. The twins pressed on, searching \nfor the lords who had challenged them. The lords had hidden among statues \nof themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito \nahead of them. When it stung the figures, \nthe lords cried out, revealing themselves. They forced the twins to spend \nthe night in the House of Darkness. They gave them a torch, but warned they\nmust return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers \nadorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies. Come morning, the lords were shocked\nto see the torch lit, but unburnt. They insisted on playing the game\nwith their own ball. The twins agreed, only to find \nthat the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court,\ntrying to kill them. The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure \nthis would be no ordinary match. They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored\nno better than a tie, leaving them to face \nwhatever supernatural trial the lords set for them \nbefore picking up the game again. They survived the House of Cold\nby lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding\nbones to the beasts. But in the House of Bats, \na bat bit off Junajpu’s head. Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round \nof the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court. The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke\ncalled the animals to him. A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness \nof a head. While the lords chased the ball,\nhe swapped it with the head. With Junajpu’s head back on his body,\nthe twins played harder than ever. Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash \nso it shattered on the ground. The twins knew their treacherous hosts\nwould not take the loss well. To protect themselves,\nthey enlisted a pair of seers. Sure enough, the lords burned\nthe brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains\nwere thrown in the river, which restored them to life. The brothers then came before the lords\ndisguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles. For their final trick, \nIxb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him. The lords were so delighted \nthat they demanded the same trick be performed on them. Still in disguise, the brothers were \nonly too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one. As the surviving lords realized \nwho stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy,\nand the twins spoke their curse. Henceforth, the lords would have\nno sacrifices and no power over the surface world.

A cannonball sewn \ninto a soldier’s uniform. And a machine that delivers \nsudden electrical pulses. These old items were all\nintended treatments for a problem that has haunted humanity\nfor millennia: snoring. It might seem harmless, but snoring can\nbe a sign of something more dangerous. So, what exactly causes snoring? \nAnd when does it become a problem? A snore’s quality can range from a\ngentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate \nfrom the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues. During sleep, the muscles \naround these tissues relax, narrowing the airway. Many factors, including congestion, \nanatomical features, and the position you’re sleeping in, can further constrict this passage \nand lead to or exacerbate snoring. The narrower the respiratory tract is,\nthe stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues \nmay vibrate, producing sound. Most of us will snore at some point\nin our lives. But loud, chronic snoring is one sign \nof a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea. It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80%\nof people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it. This is especially troublesome because it \ncan lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually\ncaused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses\nin breathing during sleep. There's one other kind of sleep apnea\ncalled central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily\nfails to regulate the body's breathing. This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually \na less prominent feature— though you can have both. If you’re experiencing \nobstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more\nseconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it,\nto catch your breath. In doing so, you might make \na snorting or a choking sound. This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases,\nit could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues\nare getting less oxygen. As you experience periods\nof low oxygen intake, your body releases stress hormones. And your blood vessels constrict to get\noxygenated blood to your vital organs. This increases your blood pressure \nand puts additional stress on your heart. And this is why obstructive sleep apnea\ncan be linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Your difficulty breathing and poor-quality\nrest may also lead to headaches, decreased concentration,\nand chronic fatigue. So what puts someone at risk of developing\nobstructive sleep apnea? Features like larger tongues, \nthicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible. Older people are more at risk \nbecause, as we age, our soft tissues loosen,\nfurther narrowing our airways. Drinking alcohol before going to sleep\ncan cause excessive relaxation of our throat and jaw muscles. And one of the main contributors \nto obstructive sleep apnea is weight gain because more tissue around the neck\ncan constrict the airway. Many researchers see weight loss \nas a solution to obstructive sleep apnea. Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting\nyour alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding \nsleeping on your back may also help. For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown\nto alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials. But these approaches, \nand devices like oral appliances, may not always be sufficient. Sleep apnea can be reliably\ntreated using CPAP machines, which keep the airway open by delivering\na constant stream of pressurized air. Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep\napnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work,\nthey may consider surgery. Snores can be silly. But intense ones are well-worth \ninvestigating with a doctor. After all, everyone needs a chance \nto catch their breath— and some z’s..."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are some ways sleep apnea can be treated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "CPAP Machine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Surgery"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Throat exercises"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the physical cause of obstructive sleep apnea?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "grinding teeth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "airway blockage"}, {"label": "C", "text": "bad pillows"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is a potential consequence of sleep apnea if left untreated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "high blood pressure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "high blood sugar"}, {"label": "C", "text": "anemia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "osteoporosis"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are some simple solutions to decrease sleep apnea?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "elevating the head of the bed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "increasing alcohol intake"}, {"label": "C", "text": "sleeping on your stomach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "gaining weight"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Who is at the highest risk for developing sleep apnea?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "young athlete"}, {"label": "B", "text": "an obese 60 year old male"}, {"label": "C", "text": "a middle aged active female"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

If you've ever lost someone\nyou truly love, ever had your heart broken, ever struggled through\nan acrimonious divorce, or been the victim of infidelity, please stand up. If standing up isn't accessible to you,\nyou can put your hand up. Please, stay standing, and keep your hand up there. If you've ever lived\nthrough a natural disaster, been bullied or been made redundant, stand on up. If you've ever had a miscarriage, if you've ever had an abortion or struggled through infertility, please stand up. Finally, if you, or anyone you love, has had to cope\nwith mental illness, dementia, some form of physical impairment, or cope with suicide, please stand up. Look around you. Adversity doesn't discriminate. If you are alive, you are going to have to,\nor you've already had to, deal with some tough times. Thank you, everyone, take a seat. I started studying\nresilience research a decade ago, at the University\nof Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. It was an amazing time to be there, because the professors who trained me had just picked up the contract\nto train all 1.1 million American soldiers to be as mentally fit\nas they always have been physically fit. As you can imagine, you don't get a much more skeptical\ndiscerning audience than the American drill sergeants\nreturning from Afganistan. So for someone like me, whose main quest in life\nis trying to work out how we take the best\nof scientific findings out of academia and bring them to people\nin their everyday lives, it was a pretty inspiring place to be. I finished my studies in America, and I returned home here to Christchurch to start my doctoral research. I'd just begun that study when the Christchurch earthquakes hit. So I put my research on hold, and I started working\nwith my home community to help them through that terrible\npost-quake period. I worked with all sorts of organizations from government departments\nto building companies, and all sorts of community groups, teaching them the ways\nof thinking and acting that we know boost resilience. I thought that was my calling. My moment to put all\nof that research to good use. But sadly, I was wrong. For my own true test came in 2014 on Queen's Birthday weekend. We and two other families had decided to go down to Lake Ohau\nand bike the outs to ocean. At the last minute, my beautiful 12-year-old daughter Abi decided to hop in the car\nwith her best friend, Ella, also 12, and Ella's mom, Sally,\na dear, dear friend of mine. On the way down,\nas they traveled through Rakaia on Thompsons Track, a car sped through a stop sign, crashing into them and killing all three of them instantly. In the blink of an eye, I find myself flung\nto the other side of the equation, waking up with a whole new identity. Instead of being the resilience expert, suddenly, I'm the grieving mother. Waking up not knowing who I am, trying to wrap my head\naround unthinkable news, my world smashed to smithereens. Suddenly, I'm the one on the end\nof all this expert advice. And I can tell you, I didn't like what I heard one little bit. In the days after Abi died, we were told we were now\nprime candidates for family estrangement. That we were likely to get divorced and we were at high risk\nof mental illness. \"Wow,\" I remember thinking, \"Thanks for that, I though\nmy life was already pretty shit.\" (Laughter) Leaflets described\nthe five stages of grief: anger, bargaining, denial,\ndepression, acceptance. Victim support arrived at our door and told us that we could expect\nto write off the next five years to grief. I know the leaflets\nand the resources meant well. But in all of that advice, they left us feeling like victims. Totally overwhelmed by the journey ahead, and powerless to exert any influence\nover our grieving whatsoever. I didn't need to be told\nhow bad things were. Believe me, I already knew\nthings were truly terrible. What I needed most was hope. I needed a journey\nthrough all that anguish, pain and longing. Most of all, I wanted to be an active participant\nin my grief process. So I decided to turn my back\non their advice and decided instead to conduct\nsomething of a self-experiment. I'd done the research, I had the tools, I wanted to know how useful\nthey would be to me now in the face of such an enormous\nmountain to climb. Now, I have to confess at this point, I didn't really know\nthat any of this was going to work. Parental bereavement\nis widely acknowledged as the hardest of losses to bear. But I can tell you now, five years on, what I already knew from the research. That you can rise up from adversity, that there are strategies that work, that it is utterly possible to make yourself think\nand act in certain ways that help you navigate tough times. There is a monumental body of research\non how to do this stuff. Today, I'm just going to share\nwith you three strategies. These are my go-to strategies\nthat I relied upon and saved me in my darkest days. They're three strategies\nthat underpin all of my work, and they're pretty readily\navailable to us all, anyone can learn them, you can learn them right here today. So number one, resilient people get that shit happens. They know that suffering is part of life. This doesn't mean\nthey actually welcome it in, they're not actually delusional. Just that when the tough times come, they seem to know that suffering is part\nof every human existence. And knowing this stops you\nfrom feeling discriminated against when the tough times come. Never once did I find myself thinking, \"Why me?\" In fact, I remember thinking, \"Why not me? Terrible things happen to you, just like they do everybody else. That's your life now, time to sink or swim.\" The real tragedy is that not enough of us\nseem to know this any longer. We seem to live in an age where we're entitled to a perfect life, where shiny, happy photos\non Instagram are the norm, when actually, as you all demonstrated\nat the start of my talk, the very opposite is true. Number two, resilient people are really good at choosing carefully\nwhere they select their attention. They have a habit of realistically\nappraising situations, and typically, managing to focus\non the things that they can change, and somehow accept\nthe things that they can't. This is a vital, learnable\nskill for resilience. As humans, we are really good at noticing threats and weaknesses. We are hardwired for that negative. We're really, really good\nat noticing them. Negative emotions stick to us like Velcro, whereas positive emotions and experiences\nseems to bounce off like Teflon. Being wired in this way\nis actually really good for us, and served us well\nfrom an evolutionary perspective. So imagine for a moment I'm a cavewoman, and I'm coming out\nof my cave in the morning, and there's a saber-toothed\ntiger on one side and a beautiful rainbow on the other. It kind of pays for my survival\nfor me to notice this tiger. The problem is, we now live in an era\nwhere we are constantly bombarded by threats all day long, and our poor brains treat\nevery single one of those threats as though they were a tiger. Our threat focus, our stress response, is permanently dialed up. Resilient people\ndon't diminish the negative, but they also have worked out a way of tuning into the good. One day, when doubts\nwere threatening to overwhelm me, I distinctly remember thinking, \"No, you do not get\nto get swallowed up by this. You have to survive. You've got so much to live for. Choose life, not death. Don't lose what you have to what you have lost.\" In psychology,\nwe call this benefit finding. In my brave new world, it involved trying to find things\nto be grateful for. At least our wee girl hadn't died of some terrible,\nlong, drawn-out illness. She died suddenly, instantly, sparing us and her that pain. We had a huge amount of social support\nfrom family and friends to help us through. And most of all, we still had two beautiful\nboys to live for, who needed us now, and deserved to have as normal a life\nas we could possibly give them. Being able to switch the focus\nof your attention to also include the good has been shown by science\nto be a really powerful strategy. So in 2005, Martin Seligman and colleagues\nconducted an experiment. And they asked people,\nall they asked people to do, was think of three good things\nthat had happened to them each day. What they found, over the six months\ncourse of this study, was that those people\nshowed higher levels of gratitude, higher levels of happiness and less depression\nover the course of the six-month study. When you're going through grief, you might need a reminder, or you might need permission\nto feel grateful. In our kitchen, we've got\na bright pink neon poster that reminds us to \"accept\" the good. In the American army, they framed it a little bit differently. They talked to the army\nabout hunting the good stuff. Find the language that works for you, but whatever you do, make an intentional,\ndeliberate, ongoing effort to tune into what's good in your world. Number three, resilient people ask themselves, \"Is what I'm doing helping or harming me?\" This is a question that's used\na lot in good therapy. And boy, is it powerful. This was my go-to question in the days after the girls died. I would ask it again and again. \"Should I go to the trial\nand see the driver? Would that help me or would it harm me?\" Well, that was a no-brainer for me, I chose to stay away. But Trevor, my husband,\ndecided to meet with the driver at a later time. Late at night, I'd find myself sometimes\nporing over old photos of Abi, getting more and more upset. I'd ask myself, \"Really? Is this helping you\nor is it harming you? Put away the photos, go to bed for the night, be kind to yourself.\" This question can be applied\nto so many different contexts. Is the way I'm thinking and acting\nhelping or harming you, in your bid to get that promotion, to pass that exam, to recover from a heart attack? So many different ways. I write a lot about resilience, and over the years, this one strategy has prompted more positive\nfeedback than any other. I get scores of letters\nand emails and things from all over the place of people saying what a huge impact\nit's had on their lives. Whether it is forgiving family\nancient transgressions, arguments from Christmases past, or whether it is just\ntrolling through social media, whether it is asking yourself whether you really need\nthat extra glass of wine. Asking yourself whether what you're doing,\nthe way you're thinking, the way you're acting is helping or harming you, puts you back in the driver's seat. It gives you some control\nover your decision-making. Three strategies. Pretty simple. They're readily available to us all, anytime, anywhere. They don't require rocket science. Resilience isn't some fixed trait. It's not elusive, that some people have\nand some people don't. It actually requires\nvery ordinary processes. Just the willingness to give them a go. I think we all have moments in life where our life path splits and the journey we thought\nwe were going down veers off to some terrible direction that we never anticipated, and we certainly didn't want. It happened to me. It was awful beyond imagining. If you ever find yourselves\nin a situation where you think \"There's no way\nI'm coming back from this,\" I urge you to lean into these strategies and think again. I won't pretend that thinking this way is easy. And it doesn't remove all the pain. But if I've learned anything\nover the last five years, it is that thinking this way\nreally does help. More than anything, it has shown me that it is possible to live and grieve at the same time. And for that, I would be always grateful. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Ludwig van Beethoven’s \nSymphony Number Five premiered in 1808, \non a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part\nof a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily\nassembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,\nthe symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece \nto “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists\nthroughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues\nto move listeners today. So what exactly makes \nBeethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven\nalready had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively\nfor religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first\nfreelance composers. He made his living \ncomposing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions\nto an adoring public. This career choice gave him the \nflexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions \ninto music. At the time, most composers worked\nwithin the Classical style, which offered limited options \nfor a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most \nof his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps \nof role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he\nexperimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was\nknown for its expressive melodies, extended forms \nand surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth\nuses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea \nis explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores \na simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the \nbuilding block for most of the movement: three short notes, \nfollowed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would \nlater call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests\nthe figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed\nthe motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create\na gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates\nforward movement, while the prolonged fourth note \nsignals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts\nand rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens \nof variations, playing out across different \ninstruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed\naround the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more \ninstruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition \nis a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation \non display. This was the first major orchestral\ncomposition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs \na high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range \nthan most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics\nfurther heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has\na clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor \nand ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease\nto majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability \nto inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony \nwhile battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard \nin the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even\nafter he became completely deaf, producing innovative music\nuntil his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif \nhas continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol \nfor suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V \nin Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code \nfor victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can\nbe found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through\nmusical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners \nthrough a dark world, then guides them into the light."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 premiered in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1770"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1808"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1824"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1827"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who was one of Beethoven’s musical role models?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Richard Wagner"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Johannes Brahms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gustav Mahler"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the well-known nickname of the foundational musical idea used throughout this piece?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the “leitmotif”"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the “fate motif”"}, {"label": "C", "text": "“Ode to Joy”"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the “Pastoral”"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "This was the first major orchestral composition to use", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "french horns"}, {"label": "B", "text": "trumpets"}, {"label": "C", "text": "trombones"}, {"label": "D", "text": "tubas"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What was one challenge that Beethoven was facing when he wrote this symphony?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "death in the family"}, {"label": "B", "text": "hearing loss"}, {"label": "C", "text": "heartbreak"}, {"label": "D", "text": "war"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How does Beethoven make the ending of this piece sound triumphant compared to the beginning of the piece?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He adds a trombone solo at the end of the piece."}, {"label": "B", "text": "He starts in the key of c minor and ends in C Major."}, {"label": "C", "text": "He writes a choral part to sing along with the orchestra."}, {"label": "D", "text": "He starts with the fate motif but ends with incorporating a new motif."}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's\nbest mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, \"Mathematics is not yet ripe\nenough for such questions.\" Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we\nmultiply by three and add one. So three times seven\nis 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply\nby 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,\nadd one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,\ndivide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,\nand then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we\nmultiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and\nthe lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,\nif you apply these rules, will eventually end up in\nthe four, two, one loop. This is commonly called\nthe Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,\nLuther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many\norigin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone\nactually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers\nyou get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height\nabove the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start\n26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes\n10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all\nthe way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is\nhigher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps\nfor 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different\nnumbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to\nmake progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something\ninvented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting\nthere twiddling their thumbs and making no progress\non this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him\nI was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and\nhe said, \"Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending\ntime writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while\nto establish yourself.\" - [Narrator] Alex\nKontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of\nthe hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths\nthey take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a\nlarge number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see\nwhat's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph\nwith a downward trend. It looks like the stock\nmarket on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of\ngeometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log\nand remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random\nwiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the\nleading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone\nnumbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many\nnumbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,\nand so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,\nand that's a short one, and for the sequences that\nstart with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this\nfor more and more numbers, eventually the histogram\nsettles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the\nmost common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with\ntwo, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases\nfor higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the\nnumbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants\nand the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is\nknown as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on\nyour income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best\nwhen the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a\ndifferent sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that\nthere are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like\nevery sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply\nan odd number by three and then add one, it will\nalways become an even number, and that means the next\nstep is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not\nactually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor\nof about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant\nfor large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one\nodd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings\nyou back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,\nyou can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you\ncan divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to\nget from one odd number to the next one, you\nmultiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more\nlikely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and\nadd one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until\nyou're down to one. One way to visualize these\npaths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a\nseries of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all\nthe way out to infinity eventually flows into the\nmassive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have\nmodified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,\norganic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the\nconjecture could be false. There could be a number\nsomewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there\nexists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off\nto infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856\nnumbers. We know, for certain, that every\nsingle one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly\n300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely\nthat the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians\nhave attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds\nsequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that\nin every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is\nsmaller than the original seed, well then you have proven\nthe Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at\nsome point get smaller, and that smaller number as\na seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X\nto the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the\nnumbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up\nunder the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest\nliving mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all\nnumbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise\nas slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or\nlog, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,\nfor almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there\nis an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave\nin 2020, Terry Tao said, \"This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture\nwithout actually solving it.\" This is an impressive result,\nbut it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is\ntrying to prove it true, which means almost no one is\nlooking for counterexamples. - It had happened to\nme just two years ago, where there was something\nI was trying to prove, that I was trying for\nthree years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what\nthe correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I\nproved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples\nthan we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,\nremember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed\nnumbers up to 10,000, with the largest number\nreached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can\nbe shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,\nclimbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just\nshoot off to infinity. And it would take only one\nto disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers\ncould be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is\nonly one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low\nvalues like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most\nconvincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture\nis Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have\na number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all\nnumbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as\nproving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one\nand 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to\n100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one\nand 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up\nto 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the\nsmaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are\nnot perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite\nnumber of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,\nwell, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,\ntwo to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya\nconjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority\nof natural numbers up to any given number have an\nodd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the\nvalue of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple\nprogram run on a turing machine. The seed number is the\ninput to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as\na string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has\ntransformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you\nlike, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that\nincreases by three over two five consecutive times, you\ncan calculate that number. If you want a number that\nclimbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or\n100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been\ntested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible\nthat someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search\nexhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is\nnot a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by\nsome intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove\na theorem that's false. And so, could it be that\neveryone is struggling to prove this thing because\nit's not actually true? And two to the 60 is\nnot a lot of evidence. And even the statistical\nversion is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory\nsomewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created\na generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine\nthat he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this\nmachine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything\na modern computer can do, but it also means that it's\nsubject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine\nnever stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject\nto the halting problem, but it is possible that\ngiven what we know, we may never prove the Collatz\nconjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of\nstuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows\nthat all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as\nthese incredibly regular things full of patterns,\nsymmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly\nin the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,\norganic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,\na spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, \"Mathematics is not yet ripe\nenough for such questions.\" (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost\nanyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure\nthings out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have\nupped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another\nto play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more\nchallenging over time. There's always a helpful\ntip or explanation that takes your understanding\nto the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are\nrelevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for\nanyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn\nsomething new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8\nmillion other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link\ndown in the description.

One in four Americans was unemployed, marking the highest unemployment rate\nin the country’s history. Tens of thousands had lost \ntheir homes and life savings, and there was very little confidence that\nRepublican President Herbert Hoover could turn things around. So when the election came, voters flocked \nto his Democratic competitor. Franklin D. Roosevelt promised\na New Deal for Americans— a comprehensive set of legislation \nto support struggling citizens and put the country back to work. The massive federal intervention Roosevelt\nproposed was a radical challenge to the individualist ideals that governed\nmany Americans’ lives. But due to the extreme circumstances, he began his presidency \nwith public and political support. With the help of his advisers, Roosevelt’s\nfirst hundred days in office were perhaps the most eventful \nof any US president. In just over three months, he pushed \nover 15 bills through Congress and created an “alphabet soup” \nof government agencies to help farmers, workers, and businesses. The New Deal’s first priority was\nstabilizing the banks. Over the previous three years, \nmany Americans had withdrawn their savings out of fear the bank would lose \ntheir money in bad investments. So to regain the public's confidence, FDR increased federal oversight\nof commercial banks, and created bank insurance to guarantee\nthat any deposited funds would always be available. Next, he established the Federal Emergency\nRelief Administration. FERA cataloged each state’s\nneed for relief and provided funds to help citizens afford\ngroceries, rent, clothing, coal, and other necessities. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Adjustment\nAdministration subsidized farmers and educated them in improving\nplanting techniques. These policies fed and housed thousands, but they didn’t significantly address \nthe New Deal’s biggest promise: reducing unemployment. So the Civilian Conservation Corps was\nestablished to employ over 250,000 young men for projects like tree planting, irrigation, \nand fire prevention. The CCC offered onsite work camps that provided food, shelter, \nand education to those employed; mostly young, single men \nwith families in need of relief. Subsequent programs \nlike the Works Progress Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority added projects building roads, bridges, \nand hydroelectric dams. The WPA also funded art, writing,\nand theater programs. These initiatives cut \ncivilian unemployment in half. And they did so alongside labor acts \nthat abolished child labor, granted unions the right \nto collective bargaining, and set the first national minimum wage. Benefits were also created to help \nthose unable to work. The Social Security Act established \nan old-age pension system in addition to unemployment insurance, \ndisability benefits, and welfare assistance. But despite these sweeping policies, the New Deal helped some groups\nmore than others. Black Americans were hit hardest\nby the economic downturn, and the New Deal’s impact \non Black communities varied widely. In northern cities like Chicago, Black citizens received a large share of \njobs, vocational training, and education, with New Deal programs teaching more than\none million Black Americans to read. Northern Black communities also received\nan influx of public housing, though it was heavily segregated. In the South, results were less positive. Roosevelt relied heavily on the support \nof Southern Democrats, who welcomed economic development \nbut fought to preserve white supremacy. They ensured that new labor laws excluded domestic servants \nand agricultural workers, occupations held by many Black Americans. These politicians and many others also\nundermined Eleanor Roosevelt’s attempts to push her husband toward supporting\na federal anti-lynching law. As a result, the New Deal has often been\ncalled a “raw deal” for Black communities. And many modern inequities in housing, \nemployment, and financial stability are partially due to New Deal programs \nprioritizing white Americans. In these ways and more, the New Deal \ndidn’t fully live up to its promises. Despite employing \nover 8 million Americans, unemployment never went\nlower than 14%. And the US economy wouldn’t fully\nrecover until the country’s mobilization for World War II. But this bold campaign \nof progressive policies did empower unions to start \ntheir own revolution. In the coming decades, northern liberals, \nBlack Americans, and other working minorities, united to fight discriminatory hiring. In the process, they reshaped\nthe Democratic Party; challenging its racist leadership, and laying the groundwork \nfor an emerging civil rights coalition."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What led President Roosevelt to introduce the New Deal?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A high national unemployment rate  "}, {"label": "B", "text": "Loss of homes and life savings across America"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The negative impact of the Great Depression"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What did Roosevelt accomplish during his first hundred days in office?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Introducing government agencies to help farmers, workers, and businesses"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Passing 15 bills"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both A and B are correct"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Stabilizing the economy and reducing unemployment rates"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "True or false?

What they found instead was \none of the oldest libraries in the world. Inscribed on crumbling clay tablets\nwas a 4,000-year-old story so riveting the first person to translate\nit started stripping from excitement. Called the epic of Gilgamesh, the story starts with Gilgamesh,\nking of the city of Uruk, crashing every wedding \nand sleeping with the bride before she has a chance \nto sleep with her husband. To tame Gilgamesh, the goddess Aruru \ncreated a rival called Enkidu. Enkidu lived beyond the walls of the city, where chaos reigned and wild animals, \ninvaders, and evil spirits prowled. After a priestess of the goddess Ishtar \nseduced Enkidu, the wild animals beyond the wall rejected\nhim and he ventured into the city. There, he encountered Gilgamesh\nup to his usual tricks. Enkidu stepped in to stop him. Almost perfectly matched, the two men\nwrestled all through the city streets until Gilgamesh won the fight by a hair. Afterwards, they were inseparable. With his new friend, Gilgamesh turned \nhis attention from the brides of Uruk to proving his strength in combat. They set out to slay Humbaba, a creature with a thousand faces who\nguarded the trees of the Forest of Cedar. They tracked Humbaba and ambushed him. Cornered, he begged for his life, then cursed them \nas Gilgamesh dealt the final blow. Back home in Uruk, the goddess Ishtar \ntook a romantic interest in Gilgamesh. Knowing she tended to lose interest\nand curse her former flames, Gilgamesh refused her advances. So Ishtar unleashed the Bull of Heaven \non Uruk to destroy crops and kill people. When Gilgamesh and Enkidu slayed \nthe creature defending the city, the gods killed Enkidu. He entered the House of Dust, the shadowy Mesopotamian underworld \nwhere the spirits of the dead knelt eternally on the ground, \neating dirt and drinking stone. Grieving for Enkidu and terrified\nof meeting this fate himself, Gilgamesh set off beyond the cosmic\nmountains to seek immortality. He passed scorpion people\nand groves of gemstone trees, travelled beneath the mountains \nand outran the rising sun, until he finally came \nto the end of the world, where he found a bar. The bartender was a goddess named Shiduri, who urged Gilgamesh to give up his quest. She told him all mortals must die, but until death comes,\nhe should enjoy his life. But Gilgamesh refused to give up. Reluctantly, Shiduri gave him directions\nto cross the Waters of Death and meet the immortal man Utanapishti. The gods had granted Utanapishti\nimmortality following a great flood, during which he built a boat, loaded two of every animal onto it,\nand landed on a mountain peak. Utanapishti also encouraged Gilgamesh \nto accept that death comes for everyone. But Gilgamesh still would not budge. So Utanapishti told him \nthat if he could conquer sleep, the gods might grant him immortality. Gilgamesh intended to stay\nawake for seven days, but fell asleep immediately. Utanapishti then told him about a magical \nplant that grew at the bottom of the ocean and granted eternal youth. Though Gilgamesh successfully\nretrieved the plant, a snake stole it on his way home. But when Gilgamesh laid eyes \non his beautiful city again, he made peace with his mortality and vowed\nto spend his lifetime doing great deeds.
