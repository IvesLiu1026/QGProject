We hear about it in weather forecasts, like there's an 80% chance\nof snow tomorrow. It's used in making predictions in sports, such as determining the odds\nfor who will win the Super Bowl. Probability is also used in helping\nto set auto insurance rates and it's what keeps casinos\nand lotteries in business. How can probability affect you? Let's look at a simple\nprobability problem. Does it pay to randomly guess\non all 10 questions on a true/ false quiz? In other words,\nif you were to toss a fair coin 10 times, and use it\nto choose the answers, what is the probability\nyou would get a perfect score? It seems simple enough. There are only two\npossible outcomes for each question. But with a 10-question true/ false quiz, there are lots of possible ways\nto write down different combinations of Ts and Fs. To understand\nhow many different combinations, let's think about a much smaller\ntrue/ false quiz with only two questions.\nYou could answer \"true true,\" or \"false false,\"\nor one of each. First \"false\" then \"true,\"\nor first \"true\" then \"false.\" So that's four different ways to write\nthe answers for a two-question quiz. What about a 10-question quiz? Well, this time, there are too many\nto count and list by hand. In order to answer this question, we need\nto know the fundamental counting principle. The fundamental counting principle states that if there are A possible outcomes\nfor one event, and B possible outcomes for another event, then there are A times B ways\nto pair the outcomes. Clearly this works\nfor a two-question true/ false quiz. There are two different answers\nyou could write for the first question, and two different answers you could\nwrite for the second question. That makes 2 times 2, or, 4 different ways\nto write the answers for a two-question quiz. Now let's consider the 10-question quiz. To do this, we just need to extend\nthe fundamental counting principle a bit. We need to realize that there are two\npossible answers for each of the 10 questions. So the number of possible outcomes is 2, times 2, times 2, times 2,\ntimes 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2, times 2. Or, a shorter way to say\nthat is 2 to the 10th power, which is equal to 1,024. That means of all the ways\nyou could write down your Ts and Fs, only one of the 1,024 ways would match\nthe teacher's answer key perfectly. So the probability of you getting\na perfect score by guessing is only 1 out of 1,024, or about a 10th of a percent. Clearly, guessing isn't a good idea. In fact, what would be\nthe most common score if you and all your friends\nwere to always randomly guess at every question on\na 10-question true/ false quiz? Well, not everyone would get\nexactly 5 out of 10. But the average score, in the long run, would be 5. In a situation like this,\nthere are two possible outcomes: a question is right or wrong, and the probability\nof being right by guessing is always the same: 1/2. To find the average number\nyou would get right by guessing, you multiply the number of questions by the probability\nof getting the question right. Here, that is 10 times 1/2, or 5. Hopefully you study for quizzes, since it clearly doesn't pay to guess. But at one point, you probably took\na standardized test like the SAT, and most people have to guess\non a few questions. If there are 20 questions\nand five possible answers for each question, what is the probability\nyou would get all 20 right by randomly guessing? And what should you expect\nyour score to be? Let's use the ideas from before. First, since the probability of getting\na question right by guessing is 1/5, we would expect to get 1/5\nof the 20 questions right. Yikes - that's only four questions! Are you thinking that the probability\nof getting all 20 questions correct is pretty small? Let's find out just how small. Do you recall the fundamental\ncounting principle that was stated before? With five possible outcomes\nfor each question, we would multiply 5 times 5\ntimes 5 times 5 times... Well, we would just use 5 as a factor 20 times, and 5 to the 20th power is 95 trillion, 365 billion, 431 million, 648 thousand, 625.\nWow - that's huge! So the probability of getting all questions\ncorrect by randomly guessing is about 1 in 95 trillion."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many ways can you answer a True-False quiz that only has 2 questions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "If there are A possible outcomes for one event and B possible outcomes for another event, then there are A times B ways to pair the outcomes.

The foodie posting photos of every plate of lasagna he orders, the Iranian blogger describing the shooting death of Nedā Āghā-Soltān. Authentic narrative is the glue that connects people, providing a compelling reason to keep reading. It makes the personal universal, transcends the individual, and makes a story timeless and humanistic. How, as a journalist, do you ask the questions that yield this type of narrative? You have to know what to ask of whom. First you need to understand that every piece of journalism requires a trifecta of sourcing. If you picture the reporting process as depicted by a triangle, one side will be official sources, another side will be overview sources, and a third side will be unofficial sources. All three components are necessary in every well-reported piece. The first side has official sources. Those are the people with titles and expertise, who own the company; are spokespeople for the movement. They tell you the numbers, and the answers to how much, how many, where, when, and who. A second side of the triangle includes overview sources: academics, consultants, authors, who are not directly connected as stakeholders, but have knowledge of the big picture. Yet it is the third side of the trifecta - unofficial sources - who hold the power of the individual's insight. This is where you can find the why, Giving consequence on the event, trend, phase, or idea and what it means on a soul level to someone affected by it. So how do you mine for the gems, identifying what is compelling from what is chatter? You ask surprising questions. To achieve the complicated, fragile human connection, you regard the stories of every subject as sacred. Realize that an anecdote is oxygen that breathes life into a grey story of exposition, facts and data. What the surgeon did at home the morning he operated on a woman's brain tumor. How it feels to dream and train for the Olympics for a lifetime. There are times when it is important to convey information quickly, to present bulleted facts and updates. When a situation is urgent, when action is required now, when you need to know where the tornado will hit, how fast the fire is spreading, and if it will reach your home today. But the narrative personal stories that contribute to the buffet of journalism are pieces that have the luxury of a slow dance of information. It is this artful solicitation of story that will make the journalism memorable and will deliver the narrative bond that will connect us to each other."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Personal narrative is a new form of storytelling in 21st century media employed only in personal blogs and conversations.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The Trifecta of Sourcing that journalists use in the reporting process refers to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The use of unofficial, official and overview sources."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Using a variety of camera shots in photojournalism that include close-ups, medium shots and landscape shots."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Interviewing at least three individuals who have expertise on one topic."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Making sure that your story has at least three sources in every paragraph of text."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "An unofficial source in a story provides what kind of information?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Anecdotes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Personal insight"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Humanistic elements to enhance the story"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Connectivity for the reader of user of the content"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What elements help an interviewer mine for personal information from a subject?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Preparedness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Conversational tone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nurturing approach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Trust"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Humanistic stories provide what service for the reader?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Make the personal universal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Are an escape from the true stories"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Create empathy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ignore the Hard Facts and the official responses"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A and C"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}
{"page": 73, "lesson": 3, "title": "How fiction can change reality - Jessica Wise", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/jessica-wise-how-fiction-can-change-reality", "transcript": {"en": "Emily Dickinson said over a century ago that \"There is no frigate\nlike a book to take us lands away ...\" And it's true. When we pick up a book,\nturn on the TV, or watch a movie, we're carried away down the currents\nof story into a world of imagination. And when we land, on a shore\nthat is both new and familiar, something strange happens. Stepping onto the shore, we're changed. We don't retrace\nthe footsteps of the authors or characters we followed here. No; instead, we walk a mile\nin their shoes. Researchers in psychology, neuroscience,\nchild development and biology are finally starting to gain\nquantifiable scientific evidence, showing what writers and readers\nhave always known: that stories have a unique ability\nto change a person's point of view. Scholars are discovering evidence\nthat stories shape culture, and that much of what we believe\nabout life comes not from fact, but from fiction - that our ideas of class, marriage\nand even gender are relatively new, and that many ideologies\nwhich held fast for centuries were revised within the 18th century, and redrafted in the pages\nof the early novel. Imagine a world where class,\nand not hard work, decides a person's worth; a world where women\nare simply men's more untamed copy; a world where marriage for love\nis a novel notion. Well, that was the world\nin which Samuel Richardson's \"Pamela\" first appeared. Richardson's love story\nstarred a poor, serving-class heroine, who is both more superior and smarter\nthan her upper-class suitor. The book, challenging\na slew of traditions, caused quite a ruckus. There was more press for \"Pamela\"\nthan for Parliament. It spawned intense debate\nand several counter-novels. Still, for all those\nwho couldn't accept \"Pamela,\" others were eager\nfor this new fictional world. This best seller\nand all its literary heirs - \"Pride and Prejudice,\"\n\"Jane Eyre,\" and yes, even \"Twilight\" - have continuously shared the same tale\nand taught similar lessons, which are now conventional\nand commonplace. Similarly, novels have helped\nshape the minds of thought leaders across history. Some scholars say\nthat Darwin's theory of evolution is highly indebted to the plots\nhe read and loved. His theory privileges intelligence,\nswiftness, and adaptability to change - all core characteristics in a hero. Whether you're reading\n\"Harry Potter\" or \"Great Expectations,\" you're reading the kind of plot\nthat inspired Darwin. Yet, recent studies show that his theory\nmight not be the whole story. Our sense of being a hero -\none man or one woman or even one species\ntaking on the challenges of the world - might be wrong. Instead of being hardwired for competition for being the solitary heroes\nin our own story, we might instead be members\nof a shared quest. More Hobbit than Harry. Sometimes, of course,\nthe shoes we've been walking in can get plain worn out. After all, we haven't walked just one mile in Jane Austen's or Mark Twain's shoes - we've walked about\n100 trillion miles in them. This isn't to say that we can't\nread and enjoy the classics; we should travel with Dickens, let Pip teach us\nwhat to expect from ourselves, have a talk with Austen and Elizabeth\nabout our prides and prejudices. We should float with Twain\ndown the Mississippi, and have Jim show us\nwhat it means to be good. But on our journey,\nwe should also keep in mind that the terrain has changed. We'll start shopping around for boots that were made for walking into a new era. Take, for instance, Katniss Everdeen\nand her battle with the Capitol. Can \"Hunger Games\" lead us into thinking\nabout capitalism in a new way? Can it teach us a lesson about why the individual should not\nput herself before the group? Will \"Uglies\" reflect the dangers\nof pursuing a perfect body and letting the media\ndefine what is beautiful? Will \"Seekers\" trod a path\nbeyond global warming? Will the life-and-death struggles\nof Toklo, Kallik, Lusa and the other bears chart a course for understanding animals\nand our place in their world? Only the future will tell which stories\nwill engage our imagination, which tales of make-believe\nwe'll make tomorrow. But the good news is this: there are new stories\nto venture in every day, new tales that promise to influence,\nto create and to spark change - stories that you might\neven write yourself.

{"page": 73, "lesson": 4, "title": "Logarithms, explained - Steve Kelly", "category": "Numbers & Operations", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/steve-kelly-logarithms-explained", "transcript": {"en": "How does the difference between point 0000000398 and point 00000000398 cause one to have red eyes after swimming? To answer this, we first need a way of dealing with rather small numbers, or in some cases extremely large numbers. This leads us\nto the concept of logarithms. Well, what are logarithms? Let's take the base number, b, and raise it to a power, p, like 2 to the 3rd power, and have it equal a number n. We get an exponential equation:\nb raised to the p power, equals n. In our example, that'd be 2 raised to the 3rd power, equals 8. The exponent p is said to be the logarithm of the number n. Most of the time this would be written: \"log, base b, of a number\nequals p, the power.\" This is starting to sound a bit confusing\nwith all the variables, so let's show this with an example. What is the value of log base 10 of 10,000? The same question could be asked\nusing exponents: \"10 raised to what power is 10,000?\" Well, 10 to the 4th is 10,000. So, log base 10 of 10,000 must equal 4. This example can also be completed \nvery simply on a scientific calculator. Log base 10 is used so frequently in the sciences that it has the honor of having\nits own button on most calculators. If the calculator will figure out\nlogs for me, why study them? Just a quick reminder: the log button only computes\nlogarithms of base 10. What if you want to go into\ncomputer science and need to understand base 2? So what is log base 2 of 64? In other words,\n2 raised to what power is 64? Well, use your fingers.\n2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. So log base 2 of 64 must equal 6. So what does this have to do\nwith my eyes turning red in some swimming pools and not others? Well, it leads us into an interesting use of logarithms in chemistry: finding the pH of water samples. pH tells us how acidic\nor basic a sample is, and can be calculated with the formula:  pH equals negative log base 10 of \nthe hydrogen ion concentration, or H plus. We can find the pH of water samples with hydrogen ion concentration of \npoint 0000000398 and point 00000000398 quickly on a calculator. Punch: negative log\nof each of those numbers, and you'll see the pH's are 7.4 and 8.4. Since the tears in our eyes\nhave a pH of about 7.4, the H plus concentration of .0000000398 will feel nice on your eyes, but the pH of 8.4\nwill make you feel itchy and red. It's easy to remember logarithms\n\"log base b of some number n equals p\" by repeating: \"The base raised\nto what power equals the number?\" \"The BASE raised to what POWER\nequals the NUMBER?\" So now we know\nlogarithms are very powerful when dealing with\nextremely small or large numbers.

{"page": 73, "lesson": 5, "title": "The history of keeping time - Karen Mensing", "category": "Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-history-of-keeping-time", "transcript": {"en": "We check the time every day, all day long. But did you ever wonder - where did telling time come from? Why does it matter what time it is? Who determined the clock and why in the world are there so many different time zones? The first form of telling time was the sundial and the earliest sundials known from the archaeological record are obelisks from nearly 5,000 years ago. Sundials indicate the time by casting a shadow onto a surface. The object that casts the shadow is a stick in the center known as a gnomon. A well-constructed sundial can measure time with remarkable accuracy, and sundials were used to monitor the performance of clocks until the modern era. But sundials have their limitations too. Obviously they require the sun to shine, so they don't work at all during the night when it's dark. Many different devices have been used over the years to estimate the passage of time: candles and sticks of incense that burn down at fairly predictable speeds have been used, along with the hourglass. Hourglasses are devices in which fine sand pours through a tiny hole at a constant rate and indicates a predetermined passage of an arbitrary period of time. The origin of the hourglass is uncertain, although beginning in the 14th century, the hourglass was used commonly, especially on board ships. The motion of the boat on the water did not affect the hourglass, unlike other time-measuring devices. The mechanical clock was invented in the 13th century which sparked a big change in traditional timekeeping methods. This modern clock relied on the swing of a pendulum or the vibration of a quartz crystal, which was far more accurate than sand or candles. Today, the basis for scientific time is a continuous count of seconds based on atomic clocks all around the world, known as the international atomic time. Why does it matter that we keep track of time? Well, time regulates our daily lives and makes it possible to accurately communicate with people all over the world. Without a time system, we would have many challenges in farming, social structures, communication, and business. Take the American railroad system, for example. In the mid-19th century, each railroad used its own standard time generally based on the local time of its headquarters, and the railroad's train schedules were published using its own time. Some major railroad junctions served by several different railroads had a separate clock for each railroad, each showing a different time. The distance between New York and Boston is about 2 degrees, or 8 minutes, which can be the difference between making or missing your train connection. If the difference between New York and Boston is 8 minutes, imagine the difference between Boston and Australia. The use of time zones irons out these differences and makes communication significantly smoother. A time zone is a region on earth that has a uniform standard time. There are 40 time zones on land because the earliest and latest time zones are 26 hours apart. Any given calendar date exists at some point on the globe for 50 hours. So the next time someone asks you \"What time is it?\" Your answer may be a whole lot more complicated than it used to be."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The first form of telling time was the:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Candle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "iPhone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "World Clock"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Watch"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Sundial"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The origin of the hourglass is uncertain although beginning in the 14th century it was especially common to see the hourglass used:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "On board trains"}, {"label": "B", "text": "On board ships"}, {"label": "C", "text": "On board planes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In caves"}, {"label": "E", "text": "The hourglass was not commonly used in the 14th century."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A time zone is a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Region in the United States that has a uniform standard time"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Region in the Universe that has a uniform standard time"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Region on Earth that has a uniform standard time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "There is no such thing as a time zone"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The difference between New York and Boston is about:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Two degrees or 8 minutes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eight degrees or 2 minutes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Four degrees or 21 minutes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Twenty-one degrees or 4 minutes"}, {"label": "E", "text": "There is no difference"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The basis of the world clock is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The continuous count of seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The 24-hour time zone system"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Calculating differences between cities"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Greenwich Observatory"}, {"label": "E", "text": "There is no basis of the world clock."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
