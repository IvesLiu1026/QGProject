What does a healthy economy \neven look like? Does it look like this? What about like this? Economist Kate Raworth shared a\npretty interesting answer to this question on the TED Interview podcast. And it challenges an idea that most\neconomists take for granted. We live— particularly in the West, \nparticularly in the last 150 years— in a society that has a very strong belief\nthat growth is the sign of progress. And to a certain extent, it’s true. We love to see our kids grow. We love to see nature growing in spring. Growth is a wonderful,\nhealthy phase of life. But in our economies, it’s like we’ve\nturned to Peter Pan economics— the economy that never wanted to grow up. It wanted to grow and grow and grow\nforever. And it becomes this permanent phase. But we already know, in our own bodies,\nin our own lives, that there’s another side to this metaphor\nof growth that we love so much. If I told you, my friend\nhad gone to the doctor, and the doctor told her she had a growth, that already feels completely different. Because in the space of our own bodies, we know that when something \ntries to grow endlessly within this healthy, dynamic living whole, it is a threat to the health of the whole, and we do everything we can to stop it. But when we step into our economies,\nfor some reason, we think that endless growth is progress. And we are now running\ninto severe problems because we are addicted to endless growth. Simon Kuznets, he was asked in the 1930s\nby US Congress to come up, for the first time, with a single number \nto measure the output of the economy. America could say we produced so many tons\nof steel and so many bags of grain— but can we add it all together? So they commissioned him \nto do this and he said, “Yes, I can. I can add it all together\nin one number.” National income, what we now know as GDP—\nbut he gave it with a caveat. He said the welfare of a nation can\nscarcely be known from this number, don’t mix it up with welfare, right? Because it tells us nothing about \nthe unpaid caring work of parents, tells us nothing about the value\nthat’s created in communities, because that’s not priced, and it’s a measure of the flow \nof economic value. It tells us nothing about the\nliving world, the forests, the mines that get run down in order\nto create this value. But the convenience, the temptation,\nof this single number was so great that politicians sort of tucked it \nin their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race\nof pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can\nkeep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple\nfrom using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,\nand minerals and plastics, and we can use less \nof the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two: \never rising GDP and falling resource use. It’s a fabulous dream; \nwould that it would be true. We are at a time of climate emergency,\nof ecosystem collapse. We need to radically reduce \nour use of Earth’s resources, and we're nowhere close to that. So I offer it as a compass for 21st\ncentury prosperity. And this compass, silly though it sounds, it looks like a doughnut \nwith the hole in the middle. So imagine from the center of it,\nhumanity’s use of Earth’s resources radiating out from the middle\nof that picture. So in the hole, \nin the middle of the doughnut, that is the place where people \ndon’t have enough resources to meet the essentials of life. It’s where people don’t have enough\nfood or health care, or education or housing or gender equality\nor political voice or access to energy. And we want to leave nobody in that hole. We want to get everybody over a social\nfoundation of well-being, so all people on this planet can\nlead lives of dignity and opportunity and community. And in low income countries, \nit absolutely makes sense, yes, let’s see the economy grow in ways \nthat invest in health and education and transport for all. That was a very 20th century project. We're in the 21st century. We have Earth system scientists\nwho started looking at the impact we were having on the climate,\nand the loss of soils and acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer,\nand the collapse of species. And they said, hang on. We’ve been ignoring our planet. In the growing to meet human needs, \nwe have ignored the fact that we are deeply dependent \non this delicately balanced living planet. It’s the only one we know of out there. And when we use Earth’s resources \nin such a way that we begin to push ourselves beyond\nthe living capacities of this planet, we are literally undermining the life\nsupporting systems on which we depend. So, hang on, just as there’s \nan inner limit of resource use, and we call out poverty and deprivation, there’s an outer limit of humanity’s\nresource use. That’s ecological degradation. And we are breaking down\nthis planet on which we depend. So there you get the doughnut,\nyou get the inside, which is leave nobody behind in the hole. But don’t overshoot the outer ring either. And so the shape of progress\nis fundamentally changed. It’s no longer this ever rising line\nexponential growth, that we hear about in the financial news \nall the time. It’s balance. To me, a source of real hope is \nthat we deeply understand this at the level of our body. You go to the doctor, the doctor will say, have enough food, but not too much, \nenough water, oxygen, exercise, sleep, anything you like— \nhave enough, but not too much. Our health lies in balance. And if we can take that metaphor \nfrom the human body to the planetary body, we give ourselves a cracking\nchance of understanding the deep interdependence of our world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "For western economies in the last 150 years, _______ is the sign of healthy economy and progress", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Equality"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Growth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Equilibrium"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Welfare"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Some economists hoped it was possible to decouple GDP from ______", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Supply and demand"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Happiness index"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Use of earth's resources"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The hole in the middle doughnut economics represents", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the depletion of earth's resources"}, {"label": "B", "text": "maximum growth of GDP"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Extreme inequality"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Where people don't have enough resources to meet their basic needs"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Beyond the outer rim of the donut represents", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ecological destruction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sustainable living"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Global GDP growth target"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Regeneration"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Another way to think about donut economics is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the tension between equality and inequality"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the relationship between fossil fuels and renewable energy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "balance and interdependence between human needs and planetary boundaries"}, {"label": "D", "text": "How to balance the global carbon budget"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 106, "lesson": 2, "title": "Why plague doctors wore beaked masks", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-plague-doctors-wore-beaked-masks", "transcript": {"en": "The year is 1656. Your body is wracked \nby violent chills. Your head pounds,\nyour muscles are too weak to sit up, and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs are squeezing out of your neck \nand armpits. In your feverish state, you see \na strange-looking man approach, his face obscured by a beak-like mask,\nhis body covered from head to toe. He examines you \nand even without seeing his face, you know the diagnosis: you have the plague. The plague stands out as one of the most \nterrifying and destructive diseases in human history. It swept across large parts of Afro-\nEurasia in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th,\nand 19th centuries; killed tens of millions of people, and had— in the best of cases— \nabout a 40% survival rate. The European plague doctor, with his\nbeaked mask and wizard-like robes, is one of the images most popularly\nassociated with plague today. He’s often found in books and films \nabout the 14th century pandemic known as the Black Death. The only problem is\nthat’s about as accurate as placing a modern surgeon at the court\nof Louis the 14th in Versailles. The confusion is understandable though— the Black Death had several aftershocks, including a series of devastating\noutbreaks in Western Europe during the 17th century. This is when the iconic plague doctor\nactually emerged on the scene. First described in the early 17th century, the outfit consisted of a hood \nwith crystal eyepieces and a beak filled with a pungent \ncombination of herbs and compounds. This could include cinnamon, pepper,\nturpentine, roast copper, and powdered viper flesh. This recipe was inspired by the famed\n2nd century Greco-Roman physician Galen, and was thought to ward off poisoned air\nknown as miasma. People believed this bad air\nspread plague after emanating from swamps and sources of decay, such as dead plants or animal carcasses. In earlier centuries, doctors across\nEurope carried metal pomanders filled with similar mixtures, and it’s possible that the beak evolved\nas a hands-free alternative. The rest of the costume, which included \nan oiled leather robe, boots and gloves, acted as kind of an early hazmat suit, likely designed to block miasma \nfrom entering through the skin’s pores. While this shows some basic understanding\nthat plague spread from one place to another, these doctors couldn’t know that,\nin most cases, the true culprit was a tiny flea \ntransmitting the bacteria, Yersinia pestis, \nfrom one person or animal to another. It’s possible that the plague doctor’s\noutfit may have provided some unintentional protection \nfrom flea bites. However, not enough information\nsurvives to know whether the costumed doctors fared any better than\ntheir ordinarily robed counterparts. It's no surprise that this bizarre getup\nhas captured popular imagination, despite the fact that its use was limited\nto a few places in Italy and France during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Even at the time, it was viewed\nwith macabre fascination and occasionally used to mock\nthe ineffective and corrupt practices of some physicians. Until the 20th century, there was \nno effective treatment for the plague, but that didn’t stop doctors— \ncostumed or not— from trying. They consulted the works of earlier\nphysicians for guidance, did what they could to fend off miasma, and prescribed a variety \nof concoctions and antidotes. They also relied on pre-modern\nmedical mainstays. These could include bloodletting, which involved draining (sometimes \nconcerningly large amounts of) blood in an attempt to remove poison \nor restore the body’s natural balance. Or cupping, where the rim \nof a heated glass was placed over swollen lymph nodes \nin hopes of making them burst sooner— a sign, when it occurred naturally,\nthat a plague patient was on the mend. Or— perhaps most painfully—\ncautery, which involved lancing the lymph nodes\nwith a red-hot poker to release the blackened pus within. A lot has changed since their times. Modern medicine has given us the means\nto quickly identify bacterial as well as viral threats and to effectively mobilize against them. We also have access to technologies\nlike test kits, masks to deter the spread \nof respiratory viruses, and vaccines; and we conduct robust trials to make\nsure they’re safe and effective. But some things don’t change: we still depend on the courage\nand compassion of medical professionals who voluntarily risk their lives against an invisible attacker to help\nand comfort those who need it most."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many plague pandemics have there been in human history?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Without antibiotics, what is the best chance a person had of surviving the plague?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "40%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "75%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "90%"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following was NOT listed as one of the ingredients put inside plague masks?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cinnamon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Arsenic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Turpentine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Powdered viper flesh"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which bacteria causes the plague?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pustulus europa"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yersinia asianus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bubosa pestis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Yersinia pestis"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What was the plague mask designed to protect people from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Miasma"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Evil spirits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sputum"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Blood"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But during the war, the siblings\nhad a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split\nthe family business in two. At first, the feud only infected \ntheir newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided\nall of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely\nloyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and \nmarriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became \nknown as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down \nto ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide\nreally be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant \ncultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn \nto social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators \nat the University of Bristol. This team developed \nthe minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required \nto turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants \nwithout the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic, \ngender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios\nthat added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed\na control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants\nthey were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things\ncorrectly or incorrectly; but in reality, \nthe groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none\nof the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments\nor personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources\nto distribute. Each participant was free to give\nresources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources\nthey personally would receive. With all the ingredients \nfor discrimination removed and no reason for competition\nover resources, the scientists assumed this would\nmake a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined \nby a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members\nof their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing\ndetermining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them”\nwere enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes, \nresource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people \nshowing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless\nof groups? The answer that came to Tajfel \nand his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership \nto help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments\nsuggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link \nthat group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create\na meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources\nto their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite\nno clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have \nbeen conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense \nof “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes\nbehind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those\nthat underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly\ninsignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't\nalways drive people apart. Bringing individuals together \nin a new group can temporarily help people\novercome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily\nnegated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups\nis part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias\nis an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make\nour groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Social Psychologist Henri Tajfel and colleagues developed the minimal group paradigm to investigate:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Why people tend to form small groups"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The minimal conditions required for people to allocate resources based on group identity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The optimal conditions required for people to form racial stereotypes about others"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The cultural conditions required for people of different religions to turn against each other"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In the minimal group studies, participants were told that they were grouped together based on:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Racial and ethnic identity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Their political beliefs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "How well they performed on a memory task"}, {"label": "D", "text": "How well they estimated things"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The researchers working on the minimal group study purposefully used deception in order to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Confuse participants"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reduce bias and isolate the effects of group identity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Keep participants interested"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Impair participants' decision-making abilities"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When allocating resources to other anonymous study participants, participants tended to favor:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "People who belonged to their same randomly assigned group"}, {"label": "B", "text": "People who belonged to their same racial and ethnic group"}, {"label": "C", "text": "People who they had met during their pre-interview"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above (people did not show bias towards any group or individual)"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Other studies conducted in psychology have demonstrated that group identity can also influence:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Attention"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Memory"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Perception"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 106, "lesson": 4, "title": "How do oysters make pearls? - Rob Ulrich", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-oysters-make-pearls-rob-ulrich", "transcript": {"en": "While most people wouldn’t consider\nthe crusty exterior of an oyster to be particularly beautiful, opening up this craggy case might reveal\nan exquisite jewel nestled within. Yet, despite their iridescent colors\nand smooth shapes, pearls are actually made \nof the exact same material as the shell that surrounds them. Pearls, urchin spines, the shells \nof mussels, snails and clams, even coral— all these structures are made \nout of the same chemical compound: calcium carbonate. So, how does this single ingredient form\nsuch a vast array of materials? Calcium carbonate, or CaCO3, \nis common on land, and even more bountiful in the sea. The Earth’s crust is rich in calcium, and over millennia these deposits \nhave seeped into rivers and oceans. This is especially true \nnear hydrothermal vents, where hot seawater mingles \nwith calcium rich basalts. Meanwhile, when carbon dioxide in the air\ninteracts with seawater it eventually produces\ndissolved carbonate. Every year, the ocean absorbs roughly\none third of our carbon dioxide emissions, adding huge quantities of carbonate\ninto the water. It’s no surprise that sea creatures have\nmade use of these abundant compounds, but the way calcium and carbonate are\nwoven together into various shapes is surprisingly artful. Let’s return to the humble oyster. Like many aquatic mollusks,\noysters start life as exposed larvae, and quickly get to work building\na protective shell. First, an organ called the mantle secretes\nan organic matrix of proteins and other molecules \nto construct a scaffold. Then, the oyster filters the seawater, drawing out calcium and carbonate to\ncombine them into its building material. It lays this material over the scaffold, which is covered in charged proteins\nthat attract and guide the calcium carbonate molecules\ninto layers. The specific arrangement of these protein\nscaffolds depends on the mollusk species and their environment, accounting for their vast diversity \nof shell shapes, sizes, and colors. Mollusks carefully control all components \nof their calcium carbonate creations— even manipulating CaCO3 \nat the molecular level. Using special proteins, mollusks can produce \ntwo crystal structures out of CaCO3: calcite and aragonite. Both of these compounds have \nthe same chemical composition, but different qualities due to the way\ntheir crystal lattices are arranged. Calcite is the more stable of the two \nand less prone to dissolving over time, so most mollusk shells have \na sturdy outer layer of calcite. As the slightly more soluble molecule, aragonite can better adapt \nto more or less acidic environments. So most mollusk shells have \nan interior layer of aragonite to maintain their internal pH level. But one form of aragonite is stronger\nand more versatile than the rest: nacre. Mollusks make this special material\nby placing successive layers of aragonite interspersed with proteins. These layers are stacked\nlike hexagonal bricks, each surrounded by other organic material\nthat directs their orientation. The uniform layering and brick-like\nstructure of nacre is key to its signature iridescence. The layers are similar in thickness \nto the wavelength of visible light, so the light reflecting \nfrom its interior surface interferes with the light reflecting \nfrom the outer surface. When particles of light strike the nacre, they bounce around its multilayered \ncrystalline structure in a cascade of shifting rainbows. But nacre isn’t just pretty— it’s one of the strongest and lightest\nbiomaterials we know of. And it's not just oysters that produce it. In fact, numerous mollusk\nspecies deploy nacre as one of their primary\ndefense mechanisms. If an intruding parasite or even a stray\nparticle of sand irritates the mantle, the mollusk will coat the offender \nin nacre-producing cells to form what’s known as a pearl sac. These cells wrap the threat in layers \nof proteins and aragonite until eventually the cocoon \ncompletely absorbs the invader— dissolving the threat into an opalescent \nsphere of nacre. This defense mechanism is our leading\ntheory for mollusks making pearls; transforming everyday intruders\ninto timeless treasures."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where does the calcium in the oceans come from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It’s just there"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Earth’s crust"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Meteorites"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Air"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What fraction of human carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed by the ocean each year?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1/2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1/3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1/4"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1/5"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In the oyster, what is the name of the organ that secretes the shell’s scaffold?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pearl"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hinge"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Epidermis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mantle"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What minerals do mollusks mainly form?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Quartz"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Apatite"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Calcite"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Aragonite"}, {"label": "E", "text": "C and D"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Of which mineral is nacre made?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Calcite"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Apatite"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Quartz"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Aragonite"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

The 1918 Flu Pandemic. COVID-19. We tend to think of these catastrophic, \nworld-changing pandemics as very unlikely events. But between 1980 and 2020, at least three diseases emerged \nthat caused global pandemics. COVID-19, yes, but also \nthe 2009 swine flu and HIV/AIDS. Disease outbreaks are surprisingly common. Over the past four centuries, the longest stretch of time \nwithout a documented outbreak that killed at least 10,000 people\nwas just four years. As bad as these smaller outbreaks are, they’re far less deadly than\na COVID-19-level pandemic. In fact, many people born after \nthe 1918 flu lived their entire lives without experiencing\na similar world-changing pandemic. What’s the probability that you do, too? There are several ways \nto answer this question. You could look at history. A team of scientists and engineers \nwho took this approach catalogued all documented epidemics \nand pandemics between 1600 and 1950. They used that data to do two things. First, to graph the likelihood \nthat an outbreak of any size pops up somewhere in the world \nover a set period of time. And second, to estimate the likelihood\nthat that outbreak would get large enough to kill a certain percentage\nof the world's population. This graph shows that while huge\npandemics are unlikely, they're not that unlikely. The team used these two distributions\nto estimate that the risk of a COVID-19-level pandemic \nis about 0.5% per year, and could be as high as 1.4% if new diseases emerge \nmore frequently in the future. And we’ll come back to those numbers, but first, let’s look at another way\nto estimate the likelihood of a future pandemic: modeling one from the ground up. For most pandemics to happen, a pathogen,\nwhich is a microbe that can cause disease, has to spill over from its normal host by\nmaking contact with and infecting a human. Then, the pathogen has to spread widely, crossing international boundaries\nand infecting lots of people. Many variables determine whether a given\nspillover event becomes a pandemic. For example, the type of pathogen, \nhow often humans come into close contact with its animal reservoir, \nexisting immunity, and so on. Viruses are prime candidates \nto cause the next big pandemic. Scientists estimate that there are about\n1.7 million as-yet-undiscovered viruses that currently infect mammals and birds, and that roughly 40% of these have the\npotential to spill over and infect humans. A team of scientists built a model\nusing this information, as well as data about the global\npopulation, air travel networks, how people move around in communities,\ncountry preparedness levels, and how people might respond to pandemics. The model generated hundreds of thousands\nof virtual pandemics. The scientists then used \nthis catalog to estimate that the probability of another \nCOVID-19-level pandemic is 2.5 to 3.3% per year. To get a sense of how these risks\nplay out over a lifetime, let’s pick a value roughly in the middle\nof all these estimates: 2%. Now let’s build what’s called \na probability tree diagram to model all possible scenarios. The first branch of the tree\nrepresents the first year: there’s a 2% probability of experiencing\na COVID-19-level pandemic, which means there’s a 98% probability \nof not experiencing one. Second branch, same thing, Third branch, same. And so on, 72 more times. There is only one path that results\nin a fully pandemic-free lifetime: 98%, or 0.98,\nmultiplied by itself 75 times, which comes out to roughly 22%. So the likelihood of living through \nat least one more COVID 19-level-pandemic in the next 75 years \nis 100 minus 22%, or 78%. 78%! If we use the most optimistic\nyearly estimate— 0.5%— the lifetime probability drops to 31%. If we use the most pessimistic one,\nit jumps to 92%. Even 31% is too high to ignore; even if we get lucky, \nfuture generations might not. Also, pandemics are usually\nrandom, independent events: so even if the yearly probability \nof a COVID-19-level pandemic is 1%, we could absolutely get another\none in ten years. The good news is we now have tools \nthat make pandemics less destructive. Scientists estimated that early warning\nsystems, contact tracing, social distancing, \nand other public health measures saved over a million lives \nin just the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, not to mention the millions\nof lives saved by vaccines. One day, another pandemic\nwill sweep the globe. But we can work to make that day\nless likely to be tomorrow. We can reduce the risk\nof spillover events, and we can contain spillovers\nthat do happen so they don’t become full-blown pandemics. Imagine how the future might\nlook if we interacted with the animal world more carefully, and if we had well-funded, open-access \nglobal disease monitoring programs, AI-powered contact tracing\nand isolation measures, universal vaccines, \nnext-generation antiviral drugs, and other tech we haven't even thought of.

Walker", "category": "Philosophy", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-we-determine-the-value-of-a-life-rebecca-l-walker", "transcript": {"en": "Smallpox is one of the deadliest\ndiseases in history, but fortunately, it’s been eradicated\nfor over 40 years. However, samples of the virus \nthat causes smallpox still exist, leading to concern that rogue actors\nmight try to weaponize it. This is especially worrying because older smallpox vaccines\ncan have serious side effects, and modern antiviral drugs have never\nbeen tested against this disease. To protect against this potential threat, the US government is funding research\nto improve smallpox treatments and vaccines. And since it’s unethical to expose \npeople to a highly lethal virus, labs are using humanity's closest\nbiological relatives as research subjects. But is it right to harm these animals to\nprotect humanity from a potential threat? Or should our closest relatives also be\nprotected against lethal experiments? What would you do as a scientist faced\nwith this very real scenario? In many ways, this dilemma isn't new. Animals have been used in research aimed\nat improving human welfare for centuries, typically at the cost of their lives. This practice reflects the widespread\nbelief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about \nthe ethics of animal testing and how it’s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important\nphilosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life,\nwhether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used \nto consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status\nshould have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those \nmaking decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status\nhas been seen as binary— either a being’s interests matter \nfor their own sake, or they don’t. And historically, many philosophers\nbelieved that humans had moral status and other animals didn’t. Some contemporary philosophers\nlike Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status\ncomes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues \nthat people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any\ndegree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant\nthought humans have moral status because of their rational nature \nand ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then\nsuggests that beings with these capacities are “persons” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “things”\nwithout moral status. But thinkers like Christine Korsgaard \nhave argued a Kantian view should include many non-human animals \nbecause of how they value their own good. Another line of argument, suggested \nby utilitarianism’s founding father Jeremy Bentham and elaborated\nby Peter Singer, claims that a capacity for suffering makes an entity worthy \nof moral consideration. These inclusive ways of thinking about\nmoral status dramatically widen the scope of our moral responsibility, in ways some people might find unnerving. So where do our monkeys stand? Our closest genetic relatives have\nhigh social and intellectual capacities. They live cooperatively \nin complex social groups and recognize members \nof their community as individuals. They support and learn from one another— there’s even evidence \nthey respond to inequality. And of course,\nthey’re capable of suffering. Yet despite all this, \nit’s still generally common opinion that a human’s life is more valuable\nthan a monkey’s. And that while killing one human \nto save five others is typically wrong, killing one monkey to save five humans \nis regrettable, but morally acceptable. Even morally required. At some point, however, \nthis calculation starts to feel unstable. Should we kill 100 monkeys \nto save five people? How about 10,000? If moral status is binary and monkeys\ndon't have it, then theoretically, any number of monkeys could be sacrificed\nto save just one person. But if moral status comes in degrees\nand monkeys have any at all, then at some point the balance will tip. The situation you're in complicates\nthings even further. Unlike the scenarios above, there's no guarantee your work\nwill ever save human lives. This is true of any animal experiment— the process of scientific discovery only\nsometimes leads to improved medical care. But in your case,\nit’s even trickier! While the government is worried smallpox\nmight be weaponized, if they’re wrong\nthe disease will remain eradicated, and your research won’t save\nanyone from smallpox. You could try to quantify this uncertainty\nto help make your decision. But how do you determine what \nan acceptable amount of risk is? And what if there’s so much uncertainty\nthat your calculations are essentially wild guesses? These kinds of moral mathematics\nget complicated fast, and some philosophers would\nargue they’re not even the best way to make moral decisions. But whatever you decide, \nyour choice should be well justified."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Beings with moral status…", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "are always legally protected"}, {"label": "B", "text": "are allowed to act and behave in any way they want"}, {"label": "C", "text": "should have their interests taken into account by those making decisions that will impact them"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Over the years, various philosophers have argued that moral status…", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "is all or nothing—you either have it or you don’t"}, {"label": "B", "text": "comes in degrees"}, {"label": "C", "text": "applies only to humans"}, {"label": "D", "text": "applies to non-human animals"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Immanuel Kant held that moral status is rooted in", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a creature’s sense of humor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the capacity to suffer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the rational capacity to will one’s own actions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "religious tradition"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Utilitarians like Jeremy Bentham held that moral status is rooted in", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a creature’s sense of humor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the capacity to suffer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the rational capacity to will one’s actions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "religious tradition"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What kinds of risks are associated with smallpox research through animal experimentation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "We know animals will be harmed but cannot be sure of the benefits"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Governments rarely invest in this work"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The virus that causes smallpox and is used in biomedical research could be weaponized by bad actors"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A and C"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

When the moon turned red thousands of years ago, the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians feared\nthat something monstrous and evil was eating the moon. They would shout at the night sky to try and fend off the ravenous beasts and since the average lunar eclipse lasts around 100 minutes, and the moon returns to normal afterward, they\nwere probably convinced that their whooping and\nhowling actually worked. We know now that the moon\ndoesn't need our protection, but why does it turn\nred in the first place? (peaceful music) Whenever you look up at a full moon, you're seeing sunlight that's reflected off the lunar surface, so if something were\nto block that sunlight say, the earth, then in theory, the moon should disappear from view but during a total lunar eclipse when the moon passes\nthrough the earth's shadow, we get a red moon, not a vanishing one. So what's going on? To figure it out, let's take a quick trip to the lunar surface. This is a NASA simulation\nof what the earth looks like during a total lunar eclipse. Notice the red ring around our planet. Everywhere you see that\nring is either a sunrise or a sunset, and while\nit's true that no direct sunlight is reaching the lunar surface at this moment, earth's\natmosphere is bending the red wavelengths of\nlight around the planet, so that redness you see\nduring a blood moon eclipse is a combination of\nlight from every sunrise and sunset on earth,\nall happening at once. So the moon appears\nred for the same reason that sunrises and sunsets on earth are red because of a phenomenon\ncalled Rayleigh Scattering. Named after the British\nphysicist, John William Strutt, also known as Lord\nRayleigh, who discovered it in the late 19th century. It describes how different\ncolors of sunlight interact with the earth's atmosphere. Look at the sky during\ndaytime, for example. It appears blue because air molecules in earth's atmosphere scatter\nblue light more easily than red, but during sunrise and sunset, the light travels through\nmore of earth's atmosphere before reaching your eye\nwhich has two consequences. First, it means more overall\nsunlight is scattered, making the sun appear dimmer. That's why you can easily\ngaze upon the sun at sunset compared to at high noon. And secondly, more scattering\nmeans more blue light is scattered away, leaving the\nredder wavelengths behind. Similarly, the ring around earth during a total lunar eclipse is red because the sunlight travels\nthrough a long stretch of earth's atmosphere, from one end of the planet to the other. So rather than fear a blood\nmoon like the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians, why not think\nof it as a romantic moment? After all, it's the only time\nwhen you can see the sunrise and sunset simultaneously.

Too poor to pay their way through college, they now owe lenders\nmore than one trillion US dollars. They do find what jobs they can get to pay off a debt\nthat is secured on their person. In America, even a bankrupt gambler\ngets a second chance. But it is nearly impossible for an American to get discharged\ntheir student loan debts. Once upon a time in America, going to college did not mean\ngraduating with debt. My friend Paul's father\ngraduated from Colorado State University on the GI Bill. For his generation, higher education was free or almost free, because it was thought of\nas a public good. Not anymore. When Paul also graduated\nfrom Colorado State University, he paid for his English degree\nby working part-time. 30 years ago, higher education tuition\nwas affordable, reasonable, and what debts you accumulated,\nyou paid off by graduation date. Not anymore. Paul's daughter followed in his footsteps, but with one difference: when she graduated five years ago, it was with a whopping debt. Students like Kate have to take on a loan because the cost of higher education\nhas become unaffordable for many if not most American families. But so what? Getting into debt to buy\nan expensive education is not all bad if you could pay it off with the increased income\nthat you earned from it. But that's where the rubber\nmeets the road. Even a college grad\nearned 10 percent more in 2001 than she did in 2013. So ... tuition costs up, public funding down, family incomes diminished, personal incomes weak. Is it any wonder that more\nthan a quarter of those who must cannot make their student loan payments? The worst of times\ncan be the best of times, because certain truths flash up\nin ways that you can't ignore. I want to speak of three of them today. 1.2 trillion dollars of debts for diplomas make it abundantly obvious that higher education\nis a consumer product you can buy. All of us talk about education\njust as the economists do now, as an investment that you make\nto improve the human stock by training them for work. As an investment you make\nto sort and classify people so that employers\ncan hire them more easily. The U.S. News & World Report\nranks colleges just as the consumer report\nrates washing machines. The language is peppered with barbarisms. Teachers are called \"service providers,\" students are called \"consumers.\" Sociology and Shakespeare\nand soccer and science, all of these are \"content.\" Student debt is profitable. Only not on you. Your debt fattens the profit\nof the student loan industry. The two 800-pound gorillas of which -- Sallie Mae and Navient -- posted last year a combined profit\nof 1.2 billion dollars. And just like home mortgages, student loans can be bundled\nand packaged and sliced and diced, and sold on Wall Street. And colleges and universities that invest in these securitized loans profit twice. Once from your tuition, and then again from the interest on debt. With all that money to be made, are we surprised that some\nin the higher education business have begun to engage in false advertising, in bait and switch ... in exploiting the very ignorance\nthat they pretend to educate? Third: diplomas are a brand. Many years ago my teacher wrote, \"When students are treated as consumers, they're made prisoners\nof addiction and envy.\" Just as consumers can be sold and resold\nupgraded versions of an iPhone, so also people can be sold\nmore and more education. College is the new high school, we already say that. But why stop there? People can be upsold\non certifications and recertifications, master's degrees, doctoral degrees. Higher education is also marketed\nas a status object. Buy a degree, much like you do a Lexus\nof a Louis Vuitton bag, to distinguish yourself from others. So you can be the object\nof envy of others. Diplomas are a brand. But these truths are often times\nhidden by a very noisy sales pitch. There is not a day that goes by without some policy guy\non television telling us, \"A college degree is absolutely essential to get on that up escalator\nto a middle-class life.\" And the usual evidence offered\nis the college premium: a college grad who makes on average\n56 percent more than a high school grad. Let's look at that number more carefully, because on the face of it, it seems to belie the stories we all hear about college grads\nworking as baristas and cashiers. Of 100 people who enroll\nin any form of post-secondary education, 45 do not complete it in a timely fashion, for a number of reasons,\nincluding financial. Of the 55 that do graduate, two will remain unemployed, and another 18 are underemployed. So, college grads earn more\nthan high school grads, but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition and the lost wages while at college? Now even economists admit going to college pays off\nfor only those who complete it. But that's only because high school wages\nhave been cut to the bone, for decades now. For decades, workers with a high school degree have been denied a fair share\nof what they have produced. And had they received as they should have, then going to college would have been\na bad investment for many. College premium? I think it's a high school discount. Two out of three people who enroll\nare not going to find an adequate job. And the future, for them,\ndoesn't look particularly promising -- in fact, it's downright bleak. And it is they who are going to suffer the most punishing forms of student debt. And it is they, curiously and sadly, who are marketed most loudly\nabout this college premium thing. That's not just cynical marketing, that's cruel. So what do we do? What if students and parents treated\nhigher education as a consumer product? Everybody else seems to. Then, like any other consumer product, you would demand to know\nwhat you're paying for. When you buy medicines, you get a list of side effects. When you buy a higher educational product, you should have a warning label that allows consumers to choose, make informed choices. When you buy a car, it tells you how many\nmiles per gallon to expect. Who knows what to expect from a degree say, in Canadian Studies. There is such a thing, by the way. What if there was an app for that? One that linked up the cost of a major\nto the expected income. Let's call it Income-Based Tuition or IBT. One of you make this. (Laughter) Discover your reality. (Laughter) There are three advantages, three benefits to Income-Based Tuition. Any user can figure out how much money he or she will make\nfrom a given college and major. Such informed users are unlikely to fall victim\nto the huckster's ploy, to the sales pitch. But also to choose wisely. Why would anybody pay more for college than let's say, 15 percent\nof the additional income they earn? There's a second benefit\nto Income-Based Tuition. By tying the cost to the income, college administrators would be forced\nto manage costs better, to find innovative ways to do so. For instance, all of you students here pay roughly\nthe same tuition for every major. That is manifestly unfair,\nand should change. An engineering student uses more resources and facilities and labs and faculty than a philosophy student. But the philosophy student,\nas a consequence, is subsidizing the engineering student. Who then, by the way,\ngoes on and earns more money. Why should two people\nbuy the same product, pay the same, but one person receive\nhalf or a third of the service. In fact, college grads, some majors, pay 25 percent of their income\nservicing their student debt, while others pay five percent. That kind if inequity would end\nwhen majors are priced more correctly. Now of course, all this data -- and one of you is going to do this, right? All this data has to be well designed, maybe audited by public accounting firms to avoid statistical lies. We know about statistics, right? But be that as it may, the third and biggest benefit\nof Income-Based Tuition, is it would free Americans from the fear\nand the fact of financial ruin because they bought a defective product. Perhaps, in time, young and old Americans may rediscover, as the gentleman said earlier, their curiosity, their love of learning -- begin to study what they love, love what they study, follow their passion ... getting stimulated by their intelligence, follow paths of inquiry\nthat they really want to. After all, it was Eric and Kevin, two years ago, just exactly these kinds of young men, who prompted me and worked with me, and still do, in the study of indebted\nstudents in America. Thank you for your attention. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 106, "lesson": 9, "title": "Could one vaccine protect against everything?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/could-one-vaccine-protect-against-everything", "transcript": {"en": "This round structure is only about \nten billionths of a meter in diameter, but it— as well as other technologies\nin the pipeline— could be stepping stones to a monumental\npublic health ambition: a single vaccine that protects you \nagainst everything. We’ll get back to the grand vision later,\nbut first, let’s start with something that’s\nbeing developed now: a vaccine that would protect you \nagainst every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet. Here’s one flu virus particle. On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots\nof hemagglutinin proteins. Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor\non a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, \nstarting the infection. Hemagglutinin is also one of the things\nyour immune system recognizes and reacts to the most. To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th\ncentury French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Croissant! If you show Napoleon to an immune system\nand say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly\nfocus on his head. And the same is true \nfor the real hemagglutinin. One way the immune system \nremembers things is by physically interacting with them. Think of it as making plaster molds\nof parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies. The antibodies float around your\nbloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them \nare stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade. Here’s the thing, though. Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating. Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes \nin the virus’ RNA: like this or this. Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s\nhead can change enough that our antibodies become less good\nat recognizing it. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get\na new flu shot every year. But sometimes bigger changes happen. An animal, usually a pig, can\nget infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu. And those different viruses might\ninfect the same cell. If that happens, the two different viral\ngenomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways. The human flu virus could \npick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before. This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected \nby this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's\nhead are going to help you. Antigenically shifted viruses\nhave the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics. A truly universal flu vaccine would be\nable to protect against current flu strains \nand future drifted or shifted strains. But how do we design a vaccine \nagainst a strain that doesn’t exist yet? We look to the past. There are key parts of hemagglutinin\nthat haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical\nto infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be \npromising targets for universal vaccines. But there's a problem that's hindered\nclassical vaccine production. Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system\nto react to the neck. Also, because influenza-like viruses have\nbeen around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region \nthat’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza. But there’s promising science\nin development. Remember this? This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is \nto store and move iron. But it’s also the rough size and shape\nof a small virus. And if you attach viral proteins to it,\nlike this, you’d have something that looks,\nto an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless\nand very engineerable. Recently, scientists engineered \na ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies \nof the neck region of an H1 flu virus. They vaccinated mice \nwith the nanoparticle, then injected them with a lethal dose \nof a completely different subtype, H5N1. All the vaccinated mice lived; \nall the unvaccinated ones died. Going one step beyond that, there may be conserved regions \nthat we could take advantage of across different-but-related \nvirus species— like SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and a few coronaviruses \nwhich cause some common colds. Over the past few decades, a different part of the immune system\nhas come into clearer focus. Instead of antibodies, \nthis part of the immune system uses a vast array of T cells that kill,\nfor example, cells that have been infected by a virus. Vaccines that train this part\nof the immune system, in addition to the antibody response,\ncould provide broader protection. A universal flu vaccine would be a\nmonumental achievement in public health. A fully universal vaccine against all\ninfectious disease is— for the moment— squarely in the realm of science fiction, partially because we have no idea \nhow our immune system would react if we tried to train it against hundreds \nof different diseases at the same time. Probably not well. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Look at where medicine is today compared\nto where it was two centuries ago. Who knows what it’ll look like\nin another 50 or 100 years— maybe some future groundbreaking\ntechnology will bring truly universal vaccines\nwithin our grasp."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How do the hemagglutinin proteins on a virus cell facilitate a viral infection?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They fuse the viral and human membranes."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They rapidly replicate in the presence of human cells.

{"page": 106, "lesson": 10, "title": "Is capitalism actually broken?", "category": "Business & Economics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/is-capitalism-actually-broken", "transcript": {"en": "Each one of these machines represents\nthe economic system of a country. Every machine has three inputs: labor, people’s work. Capital, all the stuff \nthat a business might use, including intangibles, like ideas. And natural resources. The machine converts these inputs\ninto goods and services, and because we’re willing to pay \nfor the things the machine produces, what the machine is really creating here\nis value. Economies turn inputs into value. What determines whether the machine\nis capitalist, communist, socialist, or something else? Three dials. The first dial controls \nwho owns the capital. Over here, the government owns \nevery bit of capital, down to the last office paperclip. North Korea is probably \nthe closest economy to 0%. On the other end of the spectrum, at 100%,\nprivate citizens own all the capital. The US is about here, \nat roughly two-thirds private ownership. The second dial dictates how much control \nthe government has over what gets produced. In economies with high coordination, \nlike the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy\ncould— and would— produce. In economies with low coordination, the government might mandate a few things, but leaves most decision-making\nup to the private sector. The third dial controls how extensively\nmarkets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies\nwith no markets, where the government sets all prices,\nand consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set \nthe price of everything, even things like basic \nlife-saving health care. You can also think of this dial\nas controlling the number and extent of government regulations— from tariffs on foreign goods \nto antitrust laws to regulations on net neutrality. So, capitalism isn’t just\none type of economy— it’s a wide range of possible economies, which makes answering the question of\nwhether capitalism is broken, complicated. But we’re going to try. At the height \nof the Industrial Revolution, the dials were set pretty close \nto what we now call free market, or “laissez-faire” capitalism. There were very few regulations, and economists of the time believed\nthat capitalism’s “invisible hand”— basically, individuals acting freely\nand in their own self-interest— would produce optimal outcomes,\nboth for the economy and for society. And that’s how we ended \nup with embalming fluid in milk. In the late 1800s in the United States, \nfood manufacturers put all kinds of cheap (and sometimes dangerous) adulterants\nin food to maximize profits. What they were doing was legal,\nbut of course, wrong. There was a public outcry, \nand in 1906, Congress passed \nthe Pure Food and Drugs Act, setting the stage \nfor the Food and Drug Administration, which watches over the US’s\nfood supply to this day. These days, no economy really practices\npure “invisible hand” capitalism, but some people are increasingly worried\nthat today’s threats, like climate change and rising inequality,\ncan’t be solved by any capitalist system. Let’s look at climate change first. Capitalist economies incentivize growth. That’s created massive demand \nfor the cheapest energy possible, which, for a long time, was fossil fuels. Burning all those fossil fuels\nunquestionably drove— and continues to drive— climate change. Not only that, but the desire to maximize\nprofit usually gives corporations a powerful incentive to ignore\ninconvenient truths. Just like tobacco companies denied \nthe link between cigarettes and cancer, oil and gas companies denied \nor downplayed climate science for decades. Next, inequality. Inequality is complicated enough that\nwe made a whole video about it, but the simple story is: in many countries, inequality is rising. In the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland, \nand Australia, the top 1% of income earners have been\neating up a larger and larger share of total income over the past 50 years. In the UK, the top 1% share doubled\nfrom 7% in 1980 to 14% in 2014. But that's not the whole picture. In England, the country for which we have\nthe best data before capitalism, the share of income going\nto the top 5% of income earners peaked at around 40% in 1801, and then, as capitalism took hold, it fell\nsteadily to a low of about 17% in 1977. These days, it’s back up— \nhovering around 26%. And here’s another data point: \nin many European countries and Japan, the top 1%’s share of income came\ndown from 20 to 25% in the early 1900s to 7 to 12% today. So, is capitalism increasing inequality\nor not? It depends. Remember, there's a wide range of settings\nthat all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can\nlook very different from another's. It’s totally possible that inequality\ncould be increasing in China’s version of capitalism, \nwhile it decreases in France’s. Capitalism, it seems, \nis a double-edged sword. On the one hand,\nit generates a huge amount of value, which translates to almost everyone having\nmore money than they otherwise would. On the other hand, it also funnels\nthe biggest chunk of that money into the wallets of relatively few people. Capitalism’s staunchest defenders say \nthat with enough grit and determination, anyone can join the ranks of the wealthy. Is that really true? In a free, capitalist market, the wealth generated by successful\ncompanies mostly flows to the owners. And along with that come \nother benefits: education, health, social standing,\nand power. If owners tinker with the machine so that\nit benefits them more than others, they create a feedback loop where power\nand everything that flows with it calcifies within their families. And then you’ve got, basically, \nan aristocracy. So let’s break down the question\nwe started with: is pure, “invisible hand” capitalism, with all the dials set to the extremes,\nbroken? Yeah. But it’s also kind of irrelevant,\nsince no country uses pure capitalism. Is contemporary capitalism— as it’s practiced in much \nof the world today— broken? Well, it’s the major driver\nof climate change and in many places is contributing\nto rising inequality. And it may even be creating a de facto\naristocracy in certain countries, so, not looking good. The critical question is: \ncan we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials\nor restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down\nand build a new one from scratch?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is not an economic input?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Labor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Capital"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Natural Resources"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Goods and Services"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following is a \"dial\" that regulates different forms of capitalism?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Private ownership of capital"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Central coordination"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Use of markets to set prices"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "About ___ of US property is privately owned.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1/4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1/3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2/3"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3/4"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which US law was passed in 1906 in response to lack of regulation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pure Food and Drugs Act"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Clean Air Act"}, {"label": "C", "text": "National Environmental Protection Act"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Clean Water Act"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Between 1980 and 2014 the total share of wealth of U.K.'s top 1%", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stayed the same"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Doubled"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tripled"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Went down"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 106, "lesson": 11, "title": "What causes sleepwalking? - Emmanuel During", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-causes-sleepwalking-emmanuel-during", "transcript": {"en": "Mumbling fantastical gibberish;\ndevouring blocks of cheese in the nude; peeing in places that aren’t toilets;\nand jumping out of windows. These are all things people have\nreportedly done while sleepwalking, a behavior that’s mostly benign \nbut can be dangerous in rare cases. It's estimated that around 18% of people\nsleepwalk at least once in their lives. So, what exactly is sleepwalking? First, we have to understand just how\nmany of our daily activities do not require our active attention. Your prefrontal cortex is\nyour brain's conscious, deliberate, decision-making control hub. You might decide to get up and walk\nusing your prefrontal cortex, but the intricate coordination\nof sensory inputs and muscles that follows does \nnot require any attention. Instead, it’s mostly executed \nby a network of specialized nerve cells along the lower part of the brain \nand spinal cord, sometimes called\n“central pattern generators.” These areas govern automatic movements\nand basic actions related to survival. People with a REM sleep behavior disorder\nmay enact their dreams while they’re in REM sleep, usually keeping their eyes closed. However, this is a separate condition. Sleepwalking arises from a very different\nstage of sleep— the deepest stage of non-REM sleep,\nwhich is called “slow-wave sleep.” In this state, the cortex, \nincluding the prefrontal cortex, is essentially turned off. When someone is roused from this stage, they’ll usually appear groggy \nbefore either dozing off again or becoming fully conscious. For that moment, though, \nthey’re in an intermediate state straddling sleep and wakefulness. A sleepwalking episode is, essentially,\nan extreme, prolonged version of this. When sleepwalking, \nthe prefrontal cortex remains inactive, so the person doesn’t possess executive,\ndeliberate control over their actions. But other parts of their brain are active. And, as we know, \nthe body is capable of a lot without involving the prefrontal cortex. Sleepwalkers\navoid obstacles, walk, and speak— though it's often nonsense. Most sleepwalkers can do basic things, operating in a peaceful, unemotional, \ndreamless state. In rare cases, sleepwalkers perform more \ncomplex tasks like cooking and driving. They're occasionally guided\nby physical urges, like eating or pursuing sexual activities. And some episodes involve the brain’s\nfight or flight system, during which the person might suddenly \nperceive an imminent danger, and vocalize, cry, or even jolt out of bed\nand run away. These episodes, \ncalled “sleep terrors,” are more common in young children\nand usually result naturally. Indeed, sleepwalking is generally\nmore common in children, perhaps because the brain areas \nthat control the transition between sleep and wakefulness\nare still developing. But the exact mechanisms that cause\nsleepwalking remain unclear. Many cases appear to run in families,\nwhile others are more mysterious. Anything that could lead \nto partial awakening is thought to increase the likelihood. This includes factors that promote\ndeeper slow-wave sleep— like sedatives, hot sleep environments,\nand operating on too little sleep— or things that disrupt sleep— \nlike stress and other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea \nand restless leg syndrome. Doctors will usually evaluate \nthese factors and promote habits that aid in healthy sleep, \nsuch as exercise, stress management, and a consistent and sufficient \nsleep schedule. They’ll also often recommend \nsafety measures, like hiding dangerous items, installing \ndoor alarms and securing windows. If this doesn't help, they'll consider\ncertain medications. But many of the available treatments\nfor sleepwalking haven’t yet been rigorously studied, so how they work and how effective\nthey are is not entirely clear. So, what should you do \nif you encounter a sleepwalker? A common misconception is that rousing\na sleepwalker causes irreparable harm. Fortunately, this is not true. However, trying to forcefully wake them\ncan cause confusion and distress. The best practice seems to be \nto gently guide them back to bed; and, if they resist, to simply ensure\nthey’re safe until the episode resolves."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What percentage of people are estimated to sleepwalk at least once in their lifetime?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "12%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "18%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "32%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The network of nerve cells called the “central pattern generators” are responsible for governing:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fine motor skills"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Automatic movements related to survival"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Walking and running"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Planning for the future"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which stage of sleep does sleepwalking occur?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Slow-wave sleep"}, {"label": "B", "text": "REM sleep"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Deep-wave sleep"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dozing"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Scientists think that sleepwalking is generally more common in children.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What habit promotes healthy sleep?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Exercise"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stress management "}, {"label": "C", "text": "Consistent and sufficient sleep schedule"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 106, "lesson": 12, "title": "Why is it so hard to cure the common cold?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-is-it-so-hard-to-cure-the-common-cold", "transcript": {"en": "In 2000, a company called ViroPharma\nran clinical trials of pleconaril, a new pill designed to treat \nthe common cold. In many patients, the pill helped. But in 7 of them, \njust a few days into the treatment, researchers found mutated virus variants\nthat were almost completely resistant to pleconaril. Viruses are always mutating, but this one\nmutated so quickly that it managed to outmaneuver years of research \nand development in just a few days. If you didn't have an immune\nsystem and caught a cold, the infection would quickly spread\ndeep into your lungs. Rampant viral replication would destroy\ntissue there, until your lungs couldn’t supply your body\nwith enough oxygen and you’d asphyxiate. Unfortunately, for millions of people\naround the world who live with a less-than-fully-functional\nimmune system or who are on immunosuppressant drugs, this is a real risk: “minor” infections can turn serious\nor even deadly. But if you're fortunate enough to have\na fully functional immune system, a cold will probably give you \na few relatively mild symptoms. On average, adults catch more than\n150 colds throughout their lives. And despite the fact \nthat the symptoms are similar, the cause could be different each time. Common colds are caused by at least\n8 different families of virus, each of which can have \nits own species and subtypes. How can so many different viruses\ncause the same illness? Well, viruses can only invade\nour bodies in a few ways: one is to come in on a breath. We have to breathe, so our immune system \nsets up a bunch of frontline defenses and these are actually what produce\nmany of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune\nsystem trapping and flushing out virus. Your fever is your immune system \nraising your body temperature to slow down viral replication. And your inflamed, well, everything, that’s your immune system\nwidening your blood vessels and recruiting its white blood cell army\nto help kill the virus. So, if the common cold is caused\nby many different viruses, is a cure even possible? Here’s one fact in our favor: a single family of viruses causes \n30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all\nrhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing\nthe common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:\nvaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus\nvaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids \nwith inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak \nspread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— \nalmost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, \nthis was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids \nwere successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed\nno protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus\nhad multiple subtypes. Price’s vaccine, \nfor reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one\nor maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, \nwe get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe\ndisease and death across the original virus \nand variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly\nprotective vaccine against rhinovirus, or any other virus that causes\nthe common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery\nto replicate and spread, so it’s hard to make a molecule\nthat’s toxic to the virus without also being toxic to the human. And even if you manage to do that, the virus could mutate \nout of reach of the drug. Viruses are slippery beasts. We have, though, had some\nincredible successes: we eradicated smallpox thanks\nto an effective vaccine, the fact that it can’t hide\nout in other species, and its relatively low mutation rate. HIV, on the other hand, mutates so quickly\nthat in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation\nin the virus’s genetic code could, in theory,\nbe produced in a single day. Despite trying for decades, \nwe still don’t have a vaccine. But we do have an effective\ncocktail of HIV drugs that the virus can’t easily mutate \naway from. Unfortunately, \nwe are stuck with colds for now. But the last few decades have featured\nsome entirely game-changing medical breakthroughs,\nlike mRNA vaccines and CRISPR. CRISPR could be particularly promising\nas an antiviral agent, because it originally evolved in bacteria\nas an immune defense against viruses. In fact, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a research team showed that \na CRISPR system could degrade coronavirus and influenza genomes\nin our lung cells. They called their system prophylactic\nantiviral CRISPR in human cells.

{"page": 106, "lesson": 13, "title": "Is inequality inevitable?", "category": "Business & Economics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/is-inequality-inevitable", "transcript": {"en": "In South Africa, one of the most\nunequal countries in the world, the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns \nalmost 30% of all the country’s wealth, more than double what the bottom 90% owns. Income and wealth inequality are not new. In fact, economists and historians \nwho’ve charted economic inequality throughout history haven’t found \na single society without it. Which raises a bleak question: is inequality inevitable? One way to estimate inequality is \nwith a number called the Gini index, which is calculated by comparing \nthe income or wealth distribution of a perfectly equal society to the \nactual income or wealth distribution. The area of this shape multiplied\nby 2 is the Gini index. A Gini of 1 indicates\nperfect inequality— one person has everything \nand everyone else has nothing. You’d never see this in real life because everyone except \nthat one person would starve. A Gini index of 0 indicates\nperfect equality— everyone has exactly \nthe same income or wealth. But you also never see this in real life,\nnot even in communist countries, because for one thing, \nthat would mean paying everyone— no matter how young, old,\nwhat job they’re in or where they work— the exact same wage. Typical after-tax Ginis in developed\ncountries today are around 0.3, though there’s a wide range \nfrom pretty equal to pretty unequal. Before we go any further, you should\nknow what the Gini index— or any other measure of economic\ninequality— doesn’t tell us: it gives no information about how \nincome and wealth are distributed across genders, races, educational \nbackgrounds or other demographics; it doesn’t tell us how easy or difficult\nit is to escape poverty. And it also gives no insight \nas to how a particular society arrived at its present level \nof inequality. Economic inequality is deeply entangled\nwith other types of inequality: for example, generations \nof discrimination, imperialism, and colonialism created deeply rooted \npower and class inequalities that persist to this day. But we still need at least a rough measure\nof who gets how much in a country. That’s what the Gini index gives us. Some countries are, economically,\nmuch more unequal than others. And that’s because a significant portion\nof economic inequality is the result of choices \nthat governments make. Let's talk about some of these choices. First: what kind of economy to use. In the 20th century, some countries \nswitched  to socialism or communism for a variety of reasons, including reducing economic inequality. These changes did dramatically\nreduce economic inequality in the two largest \nnon-capitalist economies, China and the Soviet Union—\nespecially in the Soviet Union. But neither country prospered as much\nas the world's leading economies. So yes, people earned about as much\nas their neighbors did, but that wasn’t very much. This— and many other issues— contributed \nto the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. And China, to grow more quickly,\nshifted its economy towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s. What about capitalist countries? Can they choose to reduce\neconomic inequality? It’s tempting to think “no, because the whole point of \ncapitalism is to hoard enough gold coins to be able to dive into them \nlike Scrooge McDuck.” China seems to provide \nthe textbook example of this: after it became more capitalist, its Gini index shot up from under 0.4\nto over 0.55. Meanwhile, its per capita yearly income jumped from the rough equivalent \nof $1,500 to over $13,000. But there are many counter-examples: capitalist countries in which inequality\nis actually holding steady or decreasing. France has kept its Gini index\nbelow 0.32 since 1979. Ireland's Gini has been trending\nmostly downward since 1995. The Netherlands and Denmark have kept\ntheirs below 0.28 since the 1980s. How do they do it? One way is with taxes. Personal income taxes in most\ncountries are progressive: the more money you make, \nthe higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,\nthe more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income\ninequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France\nis roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce\nthe amount of wealth that a single family can amass\nover generations. Germany and many other European\ncountries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand\nto a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million \nwithout paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues\nfrom one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs \ntax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’\ndisposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, \nespecially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone\nhas access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can \ncommand a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way\nis addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access \nto the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing\nwith extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy \nsocial media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,\nperhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching \nthe surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides\nin who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent\nsocial and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality \nbetween countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have \n90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:\npower and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, \nsocieties tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops \nof wealth and power concentration."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In South Africa, the richest one-tenth of 1% own _____ percent of the country’s wealth.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "40%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does the Gini index represent?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It measures the GDP of a country in relation to another country of similar size"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It allows economists to track workers’ growth in wages"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It compares a country’s happiness index with their GDP"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It’s the ratio of a perfectly equal society to the actual wealth distribution of a country."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When China shifted its economic model from socialism to capitalism, the per capita yearly income went from $1,500 to ________________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "$12,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "$13,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "$14,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "$15,000"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How much money does the US allow someone to inherit before an estate tax kicks in?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "$12,000,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "$10,000,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "$1,000,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "$500,000"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What’s an example of ways a government might decrease inequality without direct financial transfers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Providing high-quality education"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Providing health care"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Providing access to the internet"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 106, "lesson": 14, "title": "The true science of parallel universes", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/xZmj9JKs", "transcript": {"en": "Everyone loves the idea of parallel universes\n- maybe it's the appeal of an ideal world where you have second chances and things turn\nout differently - an alternate reality where you do get into Hogwarts and the Star Wars\nprequels aren't made and you finally plug in your asymmetric computer cord correctly\non the first try... but is there really a place in science for such wistful speculation? I mean, if \"the universe\" is everything that\nthere is, you can't have two versions of it, right? Otherwise the pair would really be everything\nand what you started off calling the universe, wasn't. The problem here is terminology: physicists\nspeaking informally often say \"universe\" when they really mean \"observable universe\" - that\nis, the part of the whole universe that we've so far been able to see. And it's perfectly fine to talk about multiple\ndifferent observable universes - for example, an alien near the edge of OUR observable universe\nwill see parts of the Whole Universe that we cannot yet see, but that's a well-understood\nquestion and not what physicists normally talk about when they discuss multiple observable\nuniverses, or \"multi-verses.\" So let's cut to the chase: in physics, the\nword \"Multiverse\" normally refers to one of three distinct and largely unrelated proposed\nphysical models for the universe - none of which has been tested or confirmed by experiment,\nby the way. The three \"multiverse\" models are: Type 1) Bubble universes or baby black hole\nuniverses. This is the most straightforward kind of multiverse:\nthe basic idea is that perhaps there are other parts of the universe which are so far away\nthat we will never see them (or are inside black holes so similarly we will never see\nthem). This kind of model was created as an attempt\nto explain why our universe is so good at making stars and galaxies and black holes\nand life - as the argument goes, if each of these separate mutually un-seeable \"bubbles\"\nin the universe had slightly different laws of physics, then by definition we could only\nexist in one that had the right physical laws to allow us to exist. If you're not convinced by this logic, don't\nworry too much: there's not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 2) Membranes and extra dimensions. Inspired in part by the inability of the mathematics\nof string theory to predict the right number of dimensions for the universe in which we\nlive, string theorists proposed the idea that perhaps what we think of as our universe is\nactually just a three-dimensional surface embedded within a larger super-universe with\n9 spatial dimensions. Kind of like how each page of a newspaper\nis its own two-dimensional surface embedded within our three-dimensional world. And of course, if space had 9 dimensions rather\nthan three, there'd be plenty of space for other three-dimensional surfaces that appeared,\nlike ours, to be universes in their own right, but, like the pages of a newspaper, were actually\npart of a bigger whole. These kinds of surfaces are called \"membranes\"\nor \"branes\" for short. And as a reminder, there is not yet any experimental\nevidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 3) The many-worlds picture\nof quantum mechanics. Surprisingly, physicists still don't fully\nunderstand how the collapse of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics happens, and the many-worlds\nhypothesis makes an attempt at explanation by proposing that every possible alternate\ntimeline for the universe is real and they all happen in an ever-larger, ever-branching\nway. Like, a universal choose-your-own-adventure\nwhere every possible story happens! If this were the case, we might not realize\nit because we'd be stuck living out just one of the infinitely many possible lives available\nto us. In some ways, many-worlds is similar to the\nbubble multiverse model by proposing \"maybe anything that can happen, does. And we just happen to exist in the series\nof happenings that were necessary for us to exist.\" If you're still not convinced by this logic,\ndon't worry: there is not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Of course if you want to get imaginative,\nyou could also combine several of these models together into a multi-multiverse... a new\nsuper-speculative model based, itself, on speculative and experimentally unconfirmed\nmodels. But that's not to say we couldn't test these\nmultiverse hypotheses.

The power grids \nof the United States joined together, forming one interconnected machine\nstretching coast to coast. Today, the US power grid is the\nworld's largest machine. It contains more than 7,300 \nelectricity-generating plants, linked by some 11 million kilometers of \npowerlines, transformers and substations. Power grids span Earth’s continents,\ntransmitting electricity around the clock. They’re massive feats of engineering— but their functioning depends\non a delicate balance. Their components must always\nwork in unison, maintain a constant frequency\nthroughout the grid, and match energy supply with demand. If there's too much electricity\nin the system, you get unsafe power spikes that can\noverheat and damage equipment. Too little electricity \nand you get blackouts. So, to strike this balance, power grid operators monitor the grid\nfrom sophisticated control centers. They forecast energy demand \nand adjust which power plants are active, signaling them to turn their output \nup or down to precisely meet current demand. By considering factors like the \navailability and cost of energy resources, grid operators create a “dispatch curve,” which maps out the order in which energy\nsources will be used. The grid defaults to using energy \nfrom the start of the curve first. Usually, the resources are\nordered by price. Those at the start tend to be renewables because they have much lower\nproduction costs. Some grids, like those \nin Iceland and Costa Rica, run on more than 98% clean energy. But most dispatch curves contain\nmore of a mix of carbon-free and carbon-emitting\nenergy sources. This means that where your electricity\nis coming from— and how clean it is— \nvaries throughout the day— as often as every few minutes. Take the state of Kansas. Despite having plentiful wind resources, it regularly relies on carbon-emitting \npower plants. This is because wind energy is especially\nplentiful at night. But, this is also when \nthere’s lower demand. So, Kansas’s wind energy \nis actually regularly disposed of to prevent excess electricity \nfrom damaging the grid. And comparable scenarios\nadd up to a big problem worldwide. Thankfully, dependence on renewables\nis rising. But power grids are often unable\nto make full use of them. Many simply weren't designed around\nintermittent energy sources and can't store large amounts\nof electricity. Researchers are experimenting \nwith unique storage solutions. However, this will take time\nand substantial investment. But hope is not lost. We have the opportunity to work with\nour existing power grids in a new way: by shifting some of our energy use to the times when there’s clean \nelectricity to spare. Leaning into this concept,\ncalled “load flexibility,” we can help flatten the peaks in demand, which will place less stress on the grid\nand reduce the need for non-renewables. So researchers are developing \nautomated emissions reduction technologies that tap into energy use data and ensure that devices get electricity \nfrom the grid at the cleanest times. In fact, smart devices \nlike this already exist. So, how big an effect could they have? If smart technologies like\nair conditioners, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers were \nimplemented across the Texas power grid, the state’s emissions could \ndecrease by around 20%. In other words, simply coordinating\nwhen certain devices tap into the grid could translate to 6 million fewer tons \nof carbon released into the atmosphere \nannually from Texas alone. Now, imagine what this could look\nlike on a global scale."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately how many electricity generating plants are there in the United States?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1,200"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1,850"}, {"label": "C", "text": "7,300"}, {"label": "D", "text": "42,100"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How do individual power plants know when to turn up and down?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A central grid operator tells them when to ramp up and down"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They monitor grid demand and change in response to load"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They all agree ahead of time who will operate"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How are generating resources in the “dispatch curve” ordered?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Price"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Size"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Generation type"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Time"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Where is excess electricity from wind turbines already being thrown away?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "California"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Poland"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Quebec"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Kansas"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

When he reached her, \nhe took a deep breath, and in one sudden movement, drew his sickle \nand brought it down on her neck. Medusa’s head rolled to the ground \nand from her neck sprung two children. One of them was Chrysaor, \na giant wielding a golden sword; The other was the magnificent,\nwhite, winged horse, Pegasus. He was swifter than any other steed,\nand with the stomp of his hooves, he could alter mountains \nand draw streams from dry rock. No bridle could contain him—\nuntil one fateful day. Bellerophon, prince\nof the Greek city-state of Corinth, seemed to have it all. But his ambitions\nexceeded his earthly circumstances. What he truly wanted was \nto be a hero so great that the gods would welcome him\non Mount Olympus. Bellerophon believed that Pegasus would be\nkey in helping him reach such heights. One night, \nhe visited the temple of Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom, and prayed for the power \nto appease the mighty animal. When Bellerophon woke, \nhe found a magical golden bridle, and sped to the fountain \nthat Pegasus drank from. As soon as the horse bent\ntowards the water, Bellerophon jumped on his back\nand slipped the bridle on. Finally, Pegasus was subdued. With this conquest, Bellerophon felt\nthat he was on his way to becoming a legendary hero. He trained for battle day and night. But one training session\nwent horribly wrong, and Bellerophon mortally injured \nhis brother, Deliades. Disgraced, he was exiled to Argos, \nwhere King Proetus purified him. Bellerophon was resolved \nto repair his reputation, but the Queen of Argos had her eye on him. And when Bellerophon rebuffed\nher advances, she accused him of trying to seduce her,\nfurther tarnishing his honor. King Proetus soon devised\na plan to exact revenge. He banished Bellerophon and Pegasus \nand sent them to the kingdom of Lycia, carrying a note to Iobates, Lycia’s king. But unbeknownst to Bellerophon, he was\ncarrying a decree for his own death. Iobates considered how to dispose\nof the youth and picked just the right monster\nfor the job: the fire-breathing lion-goat-dragon \nChimera that had long been\nterrorizing his kingdom. Bellerophon— eager to achieve greatness—\njumped at the challenge. He mounted Pegasus,\nand the two shot into the sky. Swooping above the earth, they saw the \nChimera surrounded by its charred victims. Soon, they too were facing its firepower. In a sequence of agile aerial acrobatics, Pegasus dodged every blast\nfrom the Chimera as Bellerophon launched his arrows. Finally, Pegasus closed in on the beast\nat just the right angle, and Bellerophon dealt it a deadly blow. Iobates was incredulous. He was glad to be rid of the monster, \nbut still needed to deal with Bellerophon. So, he set forth more challenges, putting Bellerophon up against \nfearsome warriors, highly skilled archers, and, ultimately,\nLycia’s best soldiers. Every time, Pegasus’ power turned the tide\nin Bellerophon’s favor. Finally, Iobates had no choice \nbut to  concede that Bellerophon was a true hero. He even offered him \nhis daughter’s hand in marriage. But Bellerophon’s sights were set far\nbeyond the land of mortals. He was certain he must now be entitled\nto a place on Mount Olympus. So, he jumped onto Pegasus \nand urged him higher and higher. Zeus watched as Bellerophon,\nbuoyed by hubris, neared his palace. To punish the youth, \nhe released a single gadfly, which beelined towards Pegasus \nand bit into his flesh. This was as high \nas Bellerophon would ever get. As Pegasus flinched, \nhe flung his rider into the air, and Bellerophon fell careening\nback to Earth. Pegasus, on the other hand, \nascended with Zeus’s blessing.

The best part was discovering\na subterranean city on Mars: the first evidence of intelligent \nalien life ever found. The worst part? No one got to explore it, because that was when you lost contact\nwith Earth. You and the other 99 scientists\nhave spent the rest of the year engineering your survival, but you’re almost out of water \nand solutions. Everyone else is at the ice cap, but you’ve decided to investigate\nthe buried city to see if there are clues to how their\ncivilization survived on a desert planet. The city is mostly ruins \nexcept for three intact pyramids— two open and one sealed. In the first you find a series \nof symbols and pictograms, revealing a fortuitously \nbase 10 numbering system. The second pyramid’s facade \nis covered in these symbols. Inside you discover a device, as well as mosaic representations\nof how to use it. From those you glean the following: the device is the key to opening \nthe sealed pyramid by inputting the number \non the center block. But if you put in the wrong number,\nsomething terrible and deadly will happen. The doors to all pyramids work\non the same principle. What number should you input to open\nthe door to the sealed pyramid? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The pattern revealed by the second\npyramid is that every number is the sum of the two numbers\ndirectly beneath it. If that applies to the sealed pyramid,\n40 clearly belongs to the left of 30. The center number is the sum of 7\nand an unknown, call it x. The value of x can be determined\nby trial and error, but it’s quicker to use\nalgebraic reasoning. The number to the left of the center\nnumber is 5+x. Therefore, this block, 40, \nis equal to 5+x plus 7+x. Solving for x, x must be 14, \nmaking the central block 21. You enter 21 on the remote, \nand the door opens! Inside you find yet another riddle. The walls show the history\nof this civilization. When they lived here, the planet\nwas covered with oceans. But at a certain point, \nthey up and left Mars. In order to reserve the planet \nfor themselves while making it inhospitable to others, they moved all the water underground, using a gigantic engineering marvel\nactivated by a single lever. The lever is hidden in the Great Pyramid. Pulling the lever again would reverse \nthe process, and bring the water back to the surface. But where is this Great Pyramid? The mosaics indicate it should be \nright here, but it’s clearly not. Without it, you have no choice but to\nclimb back out of the city to the surface. And that’s when you see it. The city is the final pyramid,\nor at least one face of it. A great pyramid, indeed! The city’s architects must have \ndesigned each district to show a number when viewed from above. But only these three survived\nthe ravages of time. The key once again must be whatever\nnumber was in the center plaza. You rush there, but what number should\nyou input into the remote? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could write out the algebra again,\nbut here’s a more visual approach. Sketch a pyramid,\nand enter the known numbers. Between the 9 and the 10, you can put colored dots to represent\nthe two unknowns at the bottom. Working your way up the pyramid\nand drawing the sums as you go will reveal that 100 = 19 + 3 green dots + 3 orange dots. So 3(green + orange)=81, and green + orange, \nwhich is the middle number, must be 27. You don’t actually have to figure\nout what green and orange are— in fact, \nthey have a number of possibilities. When you enter 27, a hidden mechanism \nopens in the middle of the plaza, revealing a staircase. You descend, and finally find yourself in a room \nwith a giant lever in the middle.

This place is the Park Slope Food Co-op, and it’s one of 3 million cooperatives,\nor co-ops for short, around the world. Co-ops are a big part \nof the global economy: they employ 280 million people—\n10% of the world’s workforce and the equivalent of over $2 trillion\nflow through their doors every year. How is it possible that a business \nwith 10,000 workers doesn’t have a CEO? To answer that, we have to talk about what\na co-op is and why they were founded. Let’s rewind to 1844. A group of 28 weavers in Rochdale, England came together to create \nand co-own a store. By buying in bulk directly from suppliers,\nthey could negotiate prices, which allowed all of them to buy stuff\nthey couldn't otherwise afford. They ran the store collectively\nand democratically, which was remarkable at the time. The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers\nwasn't the world's first co-op, but it was the first to publicize \nits principles— principles that guide co-ops to this day. Today, there are all kinds of co-ops: REI in the US and S-Group in Finland\nare large consumer co-ops. Credit unions and mutual insurance\ncompanies are financial sector co-ops. And when farmers or other producers come\ntogether, that's a producer co-op. And then there are worker co-ops, like Mondragon in Spain or \nThe Cheeseboard in Berkeley, California, which are founded to provide jobs\nto people in the community. Some consumer co-ops, like Park Slope, require their members to work shifts \nin the store. In exchange for their work, members pay \n15 to 50% less for groceries, and they influence what products\nare— or aren’t— sold there. Three crucial things to know about co-ops: first, all co-ops are jointly\nowned by their members, whether those members are consumers,\nproducers, workers, or whoever. Unlike traditional companies, \nwhich can have outside shareholders, all owners of a co-op are also members. Second, co-ops are not founded\nto maximize profit. Many do turn a significant profit, \nbut that’s not their core mission. So evaluating a co-op purely \nby traditional business metrics ignores the most important reason\nfor their existence: how well do they serve their members? And third: co-ops are controlled\ndemocratically by their members. But how do decisions get made? It varies. At a small worker co-op\nlike The Cheeseboard, day-to-day operational decisions\nare just made by the workers. As co-ops get larger, they do institute\nsome form of leadership or management. Park Slope has a general manager \nwho leads the 80 or so employees. And the largest network of worker \nand consumer co-ops in the world, Mondragon, has a president \nand managers who lead the roughly 30,000 worker-owners \nand 50,000 contract workers. But leadership roles in a co-op are very\ndifferent than in a traditional company. The leadership implements policies\nthat its members or worker-owners have agreed upon, by vote. And at Mondragon workers, \ncan vote to fire the president. At a co-op, there’s no single person with overarching, top-down power \nover everyone else, like a CEO would have \nin a traditional company. Meanwhile, in both co-ops \nand traditional companies, major company-wide decisions\nare made by voting. But who votes and how is wildly different. In a traditional company, voting rights \nusually come with shares of stock. The more shares you own, \nthe more votes you have. Take Alphabet, \nthe parent company of Google: there are thousands of shareholders, but the two founders control 51% \nof the votes and therefore the direction \nof the company. In a co-op, every member \nhas the right to vote, and in most co-ops,\nevery member gets one vote. That difference results \nin radically different policies than you’d find at traditional companies. For example, Mondragon limits the salaries\nof its management to about 6 times what the lowest paid \nworker makes. In Spain, CEOs of traditional companies \nmake, on average, 143 times as much as a typical worker. At Park Slope, there’s a monthly \ngeneral meeting, where any member can show up to vote, and a motion needs a\nsimple majority to pass. It then gets taken up by\nthe Board of directors, which is composed of co-op members,\nfor official approval. At The Cheeseboard, the worker-owners \ntry to reach consensus on major decisions. This means that some decisions\ncan take a long time. For example, in the late 1970s, the workers debated whether to post\na sign outside declaring that The Cheeseboard was a collective\nfor one and a half years. But the extensive discussion, \nand disagreements, around that decision made it a solid one— The Cheeseboard still advertises\nthe fact that it’s a collective almost 50 years later. And that’s not all that’s\nworking well at co-ops. Studies in the UK show that co-op\nstart-ups are almost half as likely to close within five years\nas traditional businesses. And in one study, \nresearchers polled 600 workers at two in-home healthcare businesses: one was a worker co-op and the other\nwas a traditional company. The workers did similar work \nwith similar salaries. The biggest difference? Co-op workers were \nabout 40% happier with their jobs."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately how many cooperatives, or co-ops, are there around the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 million"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2 million"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3 million"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4 million"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers was the first", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Co-op"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Co-op to publish their principles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Co-op of weavers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Publicly traded company"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What makes a co-op, a co-op?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are jointly owned by their members"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are NOT founded to maximize profits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are controlled democratically, by their members"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Who guides the direction of a traditional company?

Like these fibers on Mr. Incredible’s shirt. And this tree stump and grass from\nthis scene from Up. Or the glimmering, out-of-focus bokeh\nbehind Bo Peep. And it’s not just Pixar. These movies look so similar you can barely tell they’re from\ndifferent animation studios. But when you look at these movies it’s clear that something different\nis happening. These lights don’t just illuminate;\nthey reveal a texture. This tree in the background \nisn’t out of focus it’s just got a simplified look. And this hair looks more like\nbrush strokes than human hair. These films are part of a new trend that’s steering animation away from \nreplicating the real world and into somewhere new. Crafting beautiful animation in CG films requires a lot of dedicated artists\nto perform specialized tasks: like rendering. Rendering is the process by which\na computer takes geometry, textures, lighting, camera inputs \nand does a bunch of math to apply all that information into\na final image. Like this one. Most render engines, like the one I’m using\nhere, are physically based which essentially means that it tries to replicate the real world physics\nof light, shadow, reflection, and more. You can see this type of rendering\nall over Pixar’s work even going back to their first movie. Rex looks like he could exist \nin the real world. Every meeting we would have, everybody\nbrought up like the Pixar look. The Pixar look was something that was very\nhigh quality very successful at the box office so everybody kind of wanted the Pixar look. My name is Christos Obrenetov. Christos is the CEO of Lollipop Shaders a company that builds custom shaders\nand plugins for 3D software. He’s worked on tons of films including \"Life of Pi\", \"A Christmas Carol,\"\nand the upcoming \"Across the Spider-Verse\". But before all that he worked on a bunch of films that tried to\nreplicate that Pixar look. Because it was reliable, popular, and safe. Part of doing a feature film is, you know,\na lot of money and a lot of time. So they were kind of chasing that Pixar dream\nof having that kind of a success. So to go and spend, you know, $100 million\nor more... the investors and what not\nare probably saying: \"It's got to look like Pixar or Disney.\"\nRight? And that was the case for a long time. Even when studios wanted to try\nsomething different: Disney would come up and interview for a movie\nthat ended up being called \"Bolt\". They were showing us this really cool concept\nart and they're like, \"Oh, it's going to be super stylized.\" \"It's going to look like sort of like \nthe concept art.\" And it was very exciting. I was like, \"Oh, this is great.\" And then when the movie \ndid come out I mean, Bolt is fantastic, but they made it\nvery, you know, that same look. Movies like \"Monster House\" and \"A Christmas\nCarol\" were intended to look stylized too but ultimately they settled back into\nthat tried-and-true physically based rendering look. There were glimmers of more stylized approaches\nin short film tests and small sequences like in Disney’s Moana. But this stylized sequence\nis only about 30 seconds out of the hour and 43 minute-long film. A lot of studios have been playing with\nthis for a long time. But to take that risk to do a full feature film that's\nvery stylized in 3D I think people were scared. And that fear kept studios from making\nbold choices. Until 2017 when the trailer for\n\"Into the Spider-Verse\" dropped. It had simplified graphic bursts that felt\nlike comic book panels. There was no motion blur or depth of field and everything, from the characters to the\nenvironments, was full of texture. According to one of the animation supervisors\nfor the project after a year and a half of work the studio was still nervous that people were\ngoing to hate the visuals. Because they felt like they were taking too\nmany risks. Instead of leaning into the safe, physically\nbased, rendering look \"Into the Spider-Verse\" chose to use \nnon-photorealistic rendering. To pull this off, they essentially had to\nbreak their physically-based renderer. Instead of inputting data from lights, \ncamera, and materials and receiving a realistic looking render they combined all that data with custom\ndata passes that tweaked things like the focus plane or the way the light worked\nin an image. This combo allowed the renderer \nto produce stylized results. For example, in \"Into the Spider-verse\",\nout of focus elements aren’t blurry. Instead, the colors split as if the screen printing on an actual \ncomic book was done poorly. Lighting and shadow were approached\nin new ways too. Light often reveals halftone dots. And shadows create sketchy hatch marks. But there’s more than just shading magic\nhappening here. Non-photorealistic renderings often use linework 2D elements like speed lines and doubles and variable frame rates to pull these frames\nfurther away from reality and often, closer to the concept art. Just two months after its release \"Into the Spider-Verse\" became the highest grossing\nfilm Sony Pictures animation had ever made. It doesn’t hold a candle to Pixar\nin terms of lifetime gross: \"Incredibles 2\" sits at the number one spot while Spider-verse doesn’t even crack\nthe top 50. But, much like Pixar did in the first wave\nof CG animated features \"Into the Spider-Verse\" redefined\nthe visual goals for animation studios. 2021’s \"The Mitchells vs the Machines\" and\n2022’s \"Puss in Boots\" take non-photorealistic rendering in a different,\nmore painterly direction where out-of-focus objects \nbecome simplified shapes emulating the way that artists may use \nsimplified marks in backgrounds \"In the Mitchells vs the Machines\", shadows\ncreate different marker textures. Puss in Boots’ simplified 2D cutaways mimic\nthe graphic bursts of Into the Spider-verse. People were like, \"Oh, this is looks really\ngood and it's different\". So now, all future projects at studios from\nDreamWorks and Imageworks and Pixar— they're looking at the next whatever, five\nyears or whatnot. It's all like very stylized. And that’s really exciting because non-photorealism allows animated movies\nto take advantage of the things that make them special. They can be anything the imagination allows."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What style has Pixar mastered?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Photo-impressionist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Photo-surrealistic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Photo-realistic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Photo-synthetic"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Rendering is the process by which:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A computer creates an image using internet searches"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A computer uses AI to make animations move"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A computer takes geometry, textures, lighting, and camera inputs and applies that information into a final image"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A computer completes an artist's drawing using algebraic equations"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Non-photorealism allows animated movies to take advantage of what makes them special.

That may sound like a huge waste of time, but scientists think it must have \nsome purpose, or humans wouldn’t have evolved\nto do so much of it. So to figure out what's going on here, let’s take a closer look \nat the mind-wanderer in chief: the bored teenager. Wouldn’t it be cool to discover something,\nanything. Like even this plant. Just to be one of those explorers who \nsails around drawing stuff for years on end \nand everyone thinks they’re a genius. But does anyone even do that anymore? Is there anything left to discover? And would I be tough enough to deal \nwith the dysentery or scurvy or piranhas or whatever? I barely have the endurance\nto make it through track practice... but I will. Any day now, I’ll have the\ndiscipline to show up before sunrise and practice. I’ll win all my races. Winning will become so easy,\nI’ll pick up other events just for fun. And once I'm in the Olympics, they’ll have no choice \nbut to crown me team captain, which I will graciously accept. And will I be nasty to the teammate\nwho yelled at me? No. I’ll just calmly say, \n“hope you’re in a better mood.” Okay. Yours and other people's daydreams\nmight sound or feel something like that. Let's see what was going on. To see what parts of the brain are active when you’re doing a task, or thinking,\nor daydreaming, scientists use brain imaging techniques \nthat show increased blood flow and energy \nexpenditure in those areas. These brain areas are active, working together and communicating\nwith each other. Taken together, they're called\nthe executive network. When your mind starts to wander, a different set of brain areas\nbecomes active. These areas make up the\ndefault mode network. The name default mode makes it sound\nlike nothing is going on. And in fact, for many years, scientists associated this pattern\nof activity with rest. But a closer look reveals that these\nare the brain areas involved when we revisit a memory, when we think\nabout our plans and hopes, and yes, when our minds are wandering\noff on a wild daydream. The mind can wander to unproductive\nor distressing places and brood over negative past events,\nlike an argument. It can also wander to neutral,\neveryday matters, like planning out the rest\nof one's afternoon. But where mind-wandering \nreally gets interesting is when it crosses into the realm \nof free-moving associative thought that you aren’t consciously directing. This kind of mind-wandering is associated \nwith increases in both ideas and positive emotions, and the evidence suggests that daydreaming\ncan help people envision ways to reach their goals and navigate\nrelationships and social situations. Scientists think there may be \ntwo essential parts to this process: a generative phase of free-flowing ideas\nand spontaneous thoughts, courtesy of the default mode network, followed by a process of selecting, \ndeveloping, and pursuing the best ideas from that generative burst, driven by logical thinking \nthanks to the executive network. A host of imaging studies suggest that\nthese two networks working in sync is a crucial condition \nfor creative thinking. Taken together, the evidence clearly\nsuggests the logical realm of the executive network and the imaginative realm \nof the default mode network are closely related. And as you can see, the executive network\nis still playing a role when the default mode network is\ndoing its thing during daydreaming. In teenagers, the prefrontal cortex and other areas\ninvolved in executive function are still developing, but teens are perfectly capable of \nthinking through their problems and goals, especially when given space to do so\non their own."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Between what percentage do humans spend their days daydreaming?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Between one quarter and one third"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Between one third and one half"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Between one half and three quarters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Almost all the time"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What's the name of the network in the brain that's associated with daydreaming?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Executive Network"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dorsal Attention Network"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Default Mode Network"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Salience Network"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "With what type of activity is the executive network associated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Daydreaming"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Resting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Performing a task"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Running"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If the default mode network in your brain is active, you are most likely:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Planning a friend's birthday party"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Putting together a puzzle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Taking notes while studying"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Imagining what your future might be like"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What does the evidence suggest about the relationship between the more logical side of our brain (the executive network) and the more creative side of our brain (the default mode network)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are totally separate from one another"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They cannot operate simultaneously"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That they can be related to one another and active at the same time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "That they often come into conflict with one another"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Mather", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-the-james-webb-space-telescope-will-unfold-the-universe-john-c-mather", "transcript": {"en": "When I was six, my father told me that I was made\nout of tiny cells filled with chromosomes that would control my fate. I thought, \"That's amazing. There are so many mysterious things\nin there, and I want to know more.” I read about Galileo and Darwin,\nand I became a scientist. At that time, hardly anything was known. We did not yet know that the chemical\nelements came from exploded stars, that everything you see around you\nwas recycled from inside of stars. So we did not know we are recycled stars. But we set off to measure the Big Bang, and we measured the map of the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation, using millimeter waves and it's the entire sky\nwrapped around on to an oval so you can see it. We see that there are hot and cold\nspots in this Big Bang material. Now we say, well, that’s because those\nwere there in very, very beginning, who knows exactly why, but they led to the existence of galaxies,\nstars, planets and, eventually, people. No spots, no people. So it turned out to be important. So then how did that work? What happened next? Well, we said let's take pictures. So, of course, we take pictures of the\nsky with the Hubble Space Telescope. This picture was taken around 1995, and it shows galaxies far, far, far away. It shows what you can get with the telescope\nthat's about eight feet in diameter and can observe visible light. So we were thrilled to have this picture. And it shows thousands of galaxies. They were unable to include\nthe most distant galaxies, the ones that would be\nas they were being born, so there are no baby pictures\nof galaxies in this picture. We needed to have an even bigger\nand more powerful telescope that could pick up the infrared light\nfrom the most distant universe that has been stretched out\nby the expansion of the universe. So we didn't know what we would find. So astronomers wrote a book and they said, \"Please build us an even more\npowerful telescope.\" And we did. This is the James Webb Space Telescope,\nyou see a gigantic mirror, it's hexagonal, it's coated with gold\nso it reflects infrared light. It is 21 feet across. It is protected by a five-layer\nmetalized plastic sunshade as large as a tennis court. This telescope is so large\nthat it could not fit into the rocket without being folded up like origami. It's an incredible engineering\naccomplishment to be able to even conceive\nand build this telescope. So we built it. And then we've launched it. It went up into space from French Guiana\non Christmas morning, 2021. It was a perfect launch. The Arianespace company sent it\nstraight to where we needed to go. So we think we can have 20 years\nof operational scientific observations with this great new telescope. And it took only two minutes\nto go through the tropical clouds up towards the vacuum of outer space. Now I want to show you\nhow it unfolded in outer space, this origami telescope. First we unfolded the solar panels. Then we unfold the transmitter antenna so we can talk back and forth. Then we unfold the panels\nthat hold the great sunshade in place. This takes us actually\ntwo weeks in real life. You see it compressed here\nso we can show it to you. This is just a miracle of modern\nengineering, and it’s so complicated. And you'd say, is there any way\nyou could have done this without this great telescope? And the answer seems to be no. You need a big telescope. It needs to be in outer space. It needs to be cold, so it doesn’t glow\nand emit its own infrared. And third is, being very carefully\nunrolled all by commands from here. So you ask, how could you possibly\nmake such a complicated thing work? Well, number one, practice,\npractice, practice, rehearse and test,\nfix it when it's not quite right. And then, of course, have two\nof everything, if you possibly can. And third, have arguments\nwith all of your friends to say, is this really right? Can you think of anything that's a mistake\nthat we might be making that we should fix before we launch it? So the last step is finally\nto unfold the telescope itself. And there it is in outer space, not quite ready to use because it's still\nwarm and has not yet been focused. So we had to wait for several weeks\nfor it to start to cool down to a low enough temperature\nthat we could do the next steps. We send it to a place\ncalled Lagrange Point 2, about a million miles farther out\nfrom the Sun than we are. This is a place that moves around\nthe Sun with us every year, so the telescope does not\nget any farther away. It is the only place that we can put\na telescope where this is the setup, and you can have the one-sided umbrella\nthat protects the telescope from the Sun and the Earth and the Moon. So the next thing is, what did we see? We focused the telescope\nand took some pictures of the same star\nwe looked at with the Webb. So the fuzzy picture is the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope launched in 2003. The sharp picture\nis the new Webb telescope. We were so thrilled that it worked. We got a nice, sharp image of the star, and we can calculate now\nthe sensitivity of this object, that if you were a bumblebee, a square centimeter object\nhovering at the distance of the Moon from the Earth,\naway from the telescope, we would be able to see you, both the sunlight you reflect\nand the heat you emit. So there are no bumblebees in space, but there's something out there\nthat we don't know. And I'm so sure that we're going to get\na great surprise from this telescope. So I'll show you what we look at. Here is an example of a place\nwhere stars are being born as we speak. Now we know, more or less,\nthat stars explode and produce dust, which goes and is recycled into new stars. This is a place where\nthe recycling is happening. Stars are being born in this beautiful\ncloud of glowing gas and dust. On the left-hand side shows you\nwhat we see with visible light with the Hubble Space Telescope. The right-hand side shows you\nthat you can begin to see through the dust with an infrared camera that we also have\non the Hubble telescope. It's beautiful. Astronomers want to see inside and we will with the Webb telescope. We can look at everything\nin the solar system from Mars on out. So this is a pretty interesting one, everybody knows Mars might be alive. What about Europa? Europa is a satellite of Jupiter. It has a liquid ocean covered with ice. We know because we sent a probe\nout there named after Galileo himself, and we saw this and took this picture. Now we know that there is water\ncoming out from the cracks between the ice blocks and once in a while,\nthey can be watched from here. And we are planning to send a probe\nto fly through the water jets and see if there might be\nany organic molecules in them. Is it alive? Well, maybe. We'll be watching this satellite\nwith the Webb telescope as well. Farther on out in the solar system,\nwe've been watching Titan. Titan is the only moon in the solar system\nthat has oceans and lakes and rain and rivers\nand an atmosphere on the surface. It is so cold, though, that its liquid hydrocarbons,\nmethane and ethane, that you would use for fuel here on Earth. So we'll be examining this\nwith the Webb telescope and we'll be sending a probe out there to land with even a helicopter\nto go exploring. So is this a place\nthat's interesting for life? Possibly. People ask me all the time, are we sure that the kind\nwe have here is the only kind? Well, maybe not. And if not, this is a good place\nto look because it's different, but it still has solids,\nliquids and gases, and it has a liquid hydrocarbon,\nwhich might be a possible solvent. We'll see. Next thing we want to look at is, are there planets around other stars\nthat might have life? So we will be looking in this way at small stars that have\nEarth-sized planets. When a planet goes in front of the star,\nit can block some starlight, some of the starlight goes through\nthe atmosphere of the planet, if it has one, and on its way to our telescope, and we can analyze that and look for the chemistry\nof such an atmosphere. So, number one, does a little\nEarth-like planet out there have an atmosphere? Number two, does it have any\nmolecules in the atmosphere? And number three, could they be water? Is there enough water out there\nso that there could be a liquid ocean? Well, maybe. We will find out and we'll tell you. So are we alone? Well, I don't know. But we'll be going on after this project to even more powerful telescopes that can examine little Earths\naround stars like the Sun. And then we'll be able to say,\n\"Really, really, are they like home?\" And maybe yes. We will be telling you\nall about what we find out, beginning with our first scientific\nobservations this summer. So please stay tuned. Astronomers travel with the speed of light and the speed of imagination.

These 4 young hopefuls are brave— oh... I guess 3. \nOh, wow, 2 in 1. Okay! This single determined termite \nis braving countless threats to participate in the only flight \nof her lifetime. She evades the onslaught of predators \neven as she lands, flips off her wings, secretes pheromones, and attracts a mate. The pair dash from the danger zone\ninto a rotting tree stump. It’s the perfect first home—\nbut they’re not alone. Unlike most termite species, conehead termite colonies can have\nmultiple queens and kings. The pair is joined by several other\ntermites ready to reproduce. Together, they excavate\na chamber in the stump, seal the entrance and get busy. When the resulting offspring hatch, they \nbear little resemblance to their parents; they’re smaller, wingless,\neyeless, and sterile. Some of them, the soldiers, have the species’ trademark \nconspicuously shaped heads— the function of which will\nsoon be revealed. They set out to scout for dead wood,\nlaying the pheromone trails the rest of the offspring, \nthe colony’s workers, follow and reinforce \nas they retrieve food. As the termites collect and decompose \nplant debris, they return essential nutrients\nto the soil, allowing more vegetation to thrive. Gradually, worker termites expand\nthe colony's central chamber as they groom and feed the royals\nand the upcoming broods. The tiniest termites can’t yet\neat wood independently. So, the workers process it and gift it \nto the youngsters through their saliva and by basically throwing\nup into their mouths. With the workers managing groceries,\nconstruction, and child care, the royals fully commit themselves\nto reproduction. The kings provide sperm\non an as-needed basis, and the queens undergo radical\ntransformations. Their abdomens develop efficient \negg-laying machinery and extend dramatically. Each queen may produce hundreds\nof eggs a day. Meanwhile, a worker entourage retrieves\nand neatly stacks them into piles. The colony grows quickly. And once its population is big enough, workers construct a system of tunnels\nstretching over 100 meters across terrain, along fallen logs,\nand up into tree crowns. These tunnels shelter the termites\nas they travel to and from food sites around the clock. And eventually, they build \na distinctive central nest. Using partially digested \nplant material, soil, and poop, they construct a massive \negg-shaped structure, complete with numerous passages,\nchambers, and ventilation holes. Deep within, they establish a royal cell\nthat's fortified with extra thick walls. It’s not long before this architectural\nmarvel attracts an admirer: an anteater. She swipes at the nest \nand pokes her long tongue in. Those trapped in the tongue’s spines \nand sticky saliva are whisked off to their deaths. But the termite soldiers\nlaunch a counterattack. They’re tiny and blind but their heads\nfunction like squirt guns. They secure the anteater’s position\nusing chemical signals, clench their powerful muscles and shoot\na sticky spray from their heads. After a minute, \nthe anteater stops feeding, scratches the goo away, \nand lopes off. The nest sustained some damage, \nbut the royals remain undisturbed, pumping out eggs into their\nreinforced fortress. As the colony matures, some of the\nyoung develop into reproductives. Most fly off to establish new colonies—\none lands on a fallen tree, another scrambles into a crack \nin a house, and another climbs into a shipping crate. But some will simply saunter \nto sites nearby and become the monarchs \nof the colony’s satellite nests. With one of the longest insect lifespans, a termite queen’s reign can\nlast more than 20 years. The original queens and kings eventually\ndie, but by the time they go, several satellite nests\nare already thriving.

Its namesake, Ludwig Boltzmann,\nwas a 19th century physicist operating in a period when scientists \nwere passionately debating whether the universe had existed \nfor an infinite or finite time. Boltzmann’s main claim to fame was\nrevolutionizing thermodynamics, the branch of physics that studies energy. He put forward a new interpretation\nof entropy, which is a measure \nof the disorder of a system. A glass is an ordered system, \nwhereas a shattered glass is disordered. The second law of thermodynamics states\nthat closed systems tend towards disorder: you won’t see a shattered glass\nreturn to its pristine state. Boltzmann’s insight was applying \nstatistical reasoning to this behavior. He found that a system evolves to a more\ndisordered state because it’s more likely. However, the opposite direction\nisn’t impossible, just so unlikely that we’ll never witness\nthings like scrambled eggs turning raw. But if the universe exists\nover an infinitely long time, extremely unlikely events will happen, including complex things forming \nout of random combinations of particles. So what does that look like in a\nhypothetical infinitely old universe? In this unremarkable stretch\nof near-nothingness, about eight octillion atoms randomly\ncome together to form a replica of the Thinker made of pasta. It instantly dissolves. Over here, these particles suddenly form\nsomething like a brain. It’s filled with false memories\nof a lifetime up to the present moment, when it perceives a video saying \nthese very words, before decaying. And finally, by random fluctuations,\nall the particles in the cosmos concentrate in a single point, and an entire new universe spontaneously\nbursts into existence. Of those last two, \nwhich is more likely? The brain, by far— despite all its complexity, it’s a blip\ncompared to an entire universe. Every one universe produced by random\nfluctuations has equivalent odds to heaps upon heaps of insta-brains. So by this reasoning, \nit seems extremely more likely that everything you believe to exist \nis actually a brief illusion, soon to be extinguished. Boltzmann didn’t get quite\nthat far in his thinking; the brains themselves were introduced by\nlater cosmologists building on his work. But they, like just about everyone else, were pretty sure that they themselves\nweren't just ephemeral brains. So the paradox was: how could they be\ncorrect and the universe be eternal? The resolution is something most take \nfor granted today: that our universe\nhas not existed forever, but rather time and space\nstarted with a Big Bang. So that’s the paradox over and done with,\nright? Well, maybe not. In the last century, scientists have found\nevidence supporting the theory of the Big Bang everywhere we look. Yet while we know \nthat the Big Bang happened, no one knows what, if anything, \npreceded and caused it. Why did the universe begin in such\nan extremely ordered, and unlikely, state? Is our universe in an unending cycle\nof creation and collapse? Or might we be in one of many universes\nexpanding within a multiverse? In this context, Boltzmann’s paradox \nhas found renewed interest by contemporary cosmologists. Some argue that leading models \nfor where the universe came from still imply that Boltzmann brains \nare more likely than human brains, suggesting something’s amiss. Others counter that slight modifications\nof the cosmological models would avoid the problem, or that Boltzmann’s brains\ncan’t actually physically form. Some researchers even attempted \nto calculate the probability of a brain popping out of \nrandom quantum fluctuations long enough to think a single thought. They got this incredible number whose denominator is 10 to a number \nabout a septillion times larger than the number of stars in the universe. The Boltzmann brain paradox,\ndespite its absurdity, is useful because it creates a bar\nthat models have to rise to. If, compared to numbers like this one, the current state of the universe\nis exceedingly unlikely, something in the model is\nalmost certainly wrong.
