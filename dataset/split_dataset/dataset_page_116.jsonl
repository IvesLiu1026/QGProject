On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world\nare challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues\nonto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have\nlong been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,\nis it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters \nwere able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled \nby the most militant and violent. Protest can generate \nlasting positive change when it's followed by an equally \npassionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for\npeacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame\nof the possible. How often have you heard\nin response to a policy idea, \"That's just never going to happen\"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries\nof your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push\nthose boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens\nof conventional politics is the first step in converting\nprotest to power. But this requires concreteness about what\nit would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer\nhealthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable\nfor their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them\nfrom onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,\nchoosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life\nin the abstract. We think about things in relief\ncompared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms\nof that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate\nyou want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence\nof the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for\na $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself\ncan fix inequality, but with this ambitious \nand contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle\nand then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate\nabout economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame \nof the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,\nstrategy two. The third key strategy, then,\nis to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not \nas ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes \nwhat people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland\nemerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980\nthat forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort \nthat ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion\na positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors\none by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history \nof the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special\nto be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant\nand to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator \nof what comes next."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the primary focus of the speaker in discussing the limitations of protest?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To advocate for the complete abolition of protests"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To emphasize the importance of peaceful protest in effecting political change"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To highlight the need for additional actions beyond protests to achieve lasting political impact"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To argue that protests are sufficient on their own to create lasting political change"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not something that protest alone can achieve?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Highlighting issues on a national or global scale"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Effectively selecting new democratic leaders"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Inspiring other people to action"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Forcing out tyrants from power"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the first strategy for turning awareness into action and protest into political power?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Expanding the frame of the possible"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Choosing a defining fight"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Finding an early win"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mobilizing voters and casting ballots"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the significance of choosing a defining fight?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It ensures immediate success"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It creates contrast and sharp debate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It guarantees uncivil behavior"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It avoids contentious issues"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the importance of seeking an early win?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It sets in motion a positive feedback loop"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It creates a spirit of protest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It guarantees sudden triumph"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It eliminates the need for further action"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What historical movements exemplify the long, slow slog of securing wins?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Arab Spring, U.S. Revolution, French Revolution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "World War I, World War II, Cold War"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Industrial Revolution, Technological Revolution, Agricultural Revolution"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Civil Rights Movement, Indian Independence, Czech self-determination"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Using the case study of Seattle’s fight for a $15 minimum wage, which of the following is the best example of “expanding the frame of the possible”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Holding protests in the streets"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Accepting a long term plan for the $15 minimum wage"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pushing for a bold proposal to fight income inequality"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Not compromising stated goals for any reason"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to the speaker, who can be part of expanding the frame of the possible, picking a defining fight, or securing an early win?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only special individuals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Only those with political influence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only those who attend protests"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Anyone willing to participate and live like a citizen"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 116, "lesson": 2, "title": "Self-assembly: The power of organizing the unorganized - Skylar Tibbits", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/P8OoulWg", "transcript": {"en": "Transcriber: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is self-assembly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A process by which individuals build objects without the influence of others"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The journey from despair to happiness, a self help model"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Topics ranging from chemistry to literature, as long as it has to do with self reflection"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Where do we see self-assembly in biology?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cell division"}, {"label": "B", "text": "DNA and RNA"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Protein folding"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Where can self-assembly be observed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only in biological and chemical processes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In a limited range of scientific phenomena"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Across various fields, from magnets to social networks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Solely within the realm of robotics and social media"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What analogy is used to describe the structure of viruses?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bicycle chains"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Soccer balls"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Magnets"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Snowflakes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How is self assembly being used in the development of molecular microchips?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By relying on human intervention to arrange molecular elements"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By allowing small molecular elements to form themselves into organized pathways"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Through traditional manufacturing processes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By utilizing fossil fuels in the assembly process"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What potential application of self assembly is mentioned in the video?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Creation of traditional manufacturing processes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Formation of 2-D structures with DNA"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Use of social media to spark political action"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Building of space structures without human intervention"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "According to the video, what role can self assembly play in designing a better world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It can eliminate the need for human intervention in manufacturing processes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It can create structures that adapt independently to environmental changes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It can restrict the possibilities for technological advancements"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It can limit the potential for growth and innovation in various fields"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

tasks that we're more familiar with like problem solving and coming up with creative ideas and strategies or new products and businesses the power of cognitive diversity is even more profound and perhaps a good way to make the point conceptually is to imagine you're putting together a group of 10 people in the team to come up with creative ideas to do the next big thing in your business or organization and let's also assume that this is a talented group of people each of whom comes up with 10 genuinely useful ideas so 10 people in the team each of whom is coming up with 10 useful ideas how many useful ideas do you have in total this is a slightly trick question because you think one would think a hundred ten people ten ideas each but if they're cognitively homogeneous if they think in the same way and they come up with the same 10 ideas you only have 10 overall if on the other hand they are cognitively diverse and come up with different ideas from one another you could have a hundred useful ideas in the space of innovation which is going to dominate the future of our economy our political institutions and more engineering cognitive diversity relative to the context you get this massive uplift in what i call collective intelligence and the tragedy is two things one a psychological point we are attracted unconsciously to people who think like us when people are mirroring our perspective back to us it makes us feel smarter it validates our world view the pleasure centers of our brains light up in brain scanners when people are telling us things we already suspect or believe all confirm our prejudices and can you see the problem when it's a simple task that's fine any one person has a solution you surround yourself with like-minded others you are able to deliver the solution but as the complexity increases and no one brain is sufficient to solve the problem when you're attracted to people who think in the same way you're getting no uplift at all in collective intelligence and by mirroring each other's perspectives you become more confident about a solution that might be gravely mistaken this is why cognitive diversity is so important and i believe will become the key feature of competitive advantage for the next 50 years but here's another thing it's not just a psychological problem it's a conceptual one whilst research in the book i talked to one of the most eminent economic forecasters in the world and he said if i truly believe that my model is the best one out there then by definition i should be working with people who think like me that
