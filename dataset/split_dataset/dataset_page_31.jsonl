We don't know what it's made of,\nwhich is why we call it dark matter. But we know it's out there because we\ncan observe its gravitational attraction on galaxies and other celestial objects. We've yet to directly observe dark matter, but scientists theorize that we may\nactually be able to create it in the most powerful particle collider\nin the world. That's the 27 kilometer-long\nLarge Hadron Collider, or LHC, in Geneva, Switzerland. So how would that work? In the LHC, two proton beams\nmove in opposite directions and are accelerated \nto near the speed of light. At four collision points, the beams cross\nand protons smash into each other. Protons are made of much smaller\ncomponents called quarks and gluons In most ordinary collisions, the two\nprotons pass through each other without any significant outcome. However, in about \none in a million collisions, two components hit each other\nso violently, that most of the collision energy\nis set free producing thousands of new particles. It's only in these collisions that very\nmassive particles, like the theorized dark matter,\ncan be produced. The collision points \nare surrounded by detectors containing about 100 million sensors. Like huge three-dimensional cameras, they gather information \non those new particles, including their trajectory, electrical charge, and energy. Once processed, the computers can depict\na collision as an image. Each line is the path \nof a different particle, and different types of particles\nare color-coded. Data from the detectors \nallows scientists to determine what each of these particles is, things like photons and electrons. Now, the detectors take snapshots of about\na billion of these collisions per second to find signs of extremely rare\nmassive particles. To add to the difficulty, the particles we're looking for \nmay be unstable and decay into more familiar particles\nbefore reaching the sensors. Take, for example, the Higgs boson, a long-theorized particle that wasn't\nobserved until 2012. The odds of a given collision producing\na Higgs boson are about one in 10 billion, and it only lasts for \na tiny fraction of a second before decaying. But scientists developed theoretical \nmodels to tell them what to look for. For the Higgs, they thought it would\nsometimes decay into two photons. So they first examined only \nthe high-energy events that included two photons. But there's a problem here. There are innumerable \nparticle interactions that can produce two random photons. So how do you separate out the Higgs\nfrom everything else? The answer is mass. The information gathered by the detectors\nallows the scientists to go a step back and determine the mass of whatever it was\nthat produced two photons. They put that mass value into a graph and then repeat the process\nfor all events with two photons. The vast majority of these events\nare just random photon observations, what scientists call background events. But when a Higgs boson is produced\nand decays into two photons, the mass always comes out to be the same. Therefore, the tell-tale sign\nof the Higgs boson would be a little bump sitting on top\nof the background. It takes billions of observations\nbefore a bump like this can appear, and it's only considered \na meaningful result if that bump becomes significantly \nhigher than the background. In the case of the Higgs boson, the scientists at the LHC announced their\ngroundbreaking result when there was only \na one in 3 million chance this bump could have \nappeared by a statistical fluke. So back to the dark matter. If the LHC's proton beams have enough\nenergy to produce it, that's probably an even rarer occurrence\nthan the Higgs boson. So it takes quadrillions of collisions\ncombined with theoretical models to even start to look. That's what the LHC is currently doing. By generating a mountain of data, we're hoping to find more tiny bumps\nin graphs that will provide evidence for\nyet unknown particles, like dark matter. Or maybe what we'll \nfind won't be dark matter, but something else that would reshape our understanding \nof how the universe works entirely. That's part of the fun at this point. We have no idea what we're\ngoing to find."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is dark matter made of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Quarks and gluons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Black holes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Antimatter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nobody knows"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Does a proton have a sub-structure?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "No, it is a point-like particle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No, it is a solid object with a diameter of 1 fm"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Yes, it is a diffuse object with a diameter of 1 fm, made of quarks and gluons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Yes, it has a very small nucleus surrounded by electrons"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In 2012, a Higgs boson was produced in one out of ..... proton-proton collisions at the LHC", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10,000,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10,000,000,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10,000,000,000,000"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In the LHC, two protons collide about ________ times per second.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 thousand"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1 million"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 billion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1 trillion"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Higgs boson was discovered by detecting its decay into:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2 photons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Electron-positron pairs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Proton-antiproton pairs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neutrino-antineutrino pairs"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Jarausch", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-berlin-wall-konrad-h-jarausch", "transcript": {"en": "In the early hours of August 13, 1961, East German construction workers flanked\nby soldiers and police began tearing up streets and erecting\nbarriers throughout the city of Berlin and its surroundings. This night marked the beginning of one\nof history's most infamous dividing lines, the Berlin Wall. Construction on the wall continued\nfor the next decade as it cut through neighborhoods, separated families, and divided not just Germany,\nbut the world. To understand how we got to this point, we have to go back to World War II. America, Britain, and France joined forces with the Soviet Union\nagainst the Axis Powers. After they defeated Nazi Germany, each of the victorious nations occupied\npart of the country. The division was meant to be temporary, but the former allies found \nthemselves at odds over their visions for post-war Europe. While Western powers promoted\nliberal market economies, the Soviet Union sought to surround itself\nwith obedient Communist nations, including a weakened Germany. As their relations deteriorated, the Federal Republic of Germany\nwas formed in the West while the Soviets established the\nGerman Democratic Republic in the East. The Soviet satellite countries restricted\nWestern trade and movement, so a virtually impassable border formed. It became known as the Iron Curtain. In the former German capital of Berlin,\nthings were particularly complicated. Although the city lay fully within\nthe East German territory of the GDR, the post-war agreement gave the allies\njoint administration. So America, Britain, and France created\na Democratic enclave in Berlin's western districts. While East Germans were officially banned\nfrom leaving the country, in Berlin, it was simply \na matter of walking, or riding a subway, streetcar or bus, to the Western half, then traveling on to West Germany\nor beyond. This open border posed a problem\nfor the East German leadership. They had staked a claim to represent\nthe Communist resistance against Hitler and portrayed Western Germany as\na continuation of the Nazi regime. While the U.S. and its allies poured\nmoney into West Germany's reconstruction, the Soviet Union extracted resources\nfrom the East as war reparations, making its planned economy \neven less competitive. Life in East Germany passed under\nthe watchful eye of the Stasi, the secret police whose wiretaps \nand informants monitored citizens for any hint of disloyalty. While there was free health care\nand education in the East, the West boasted higher salaries, more consumer goods, and greater personal freedom. By 1961, about 3.5 million people,\nnearly 20% of the East German population, had left, \nincluding many young professionals. To prevent further losses, East Germany decided to close the border,\nand that's where the Berlin Wall came in. Extending for 43 kilometers\nthrough Berlin, and a further 112 through East Germany, the initial barrier consisted\nof barbed wire and mesh fencing. Some Berliners escaped by\njumping over the wire or leaving from windows, but as the wall expanded,\nthis became more difficult. By 1965, 106 kilometers of 3.6-meter-high\nconcrete barricades had been added topped with a smooth \npipe to prevent climbing. Over the coming years, the barrier\nwas strengthened with spike strips, guard dogs, and even landmines, along with 302 watchtowers\nand 20 bunkers. A parallel fence in the rear set off\na 100-meter area called the death strip. There, all buildings were demolished\nand the ground covered with sand to provide a clear line of sight\nfor the hundreds of guards ordered to shoot anyone \nattempting to cross. Nevertheless, nearly 5,000 people\nin total managed to flee East Germany between 1961 and 1989. Some were diplomats or athletes\nwho defected while abroad, but others were ordinary citizens who\ndug tunnels, swam across canals, flew hot air balloons, or even crashed a stolen tank\nthrough the wall. Yet the risk was great. Over 138 people died\nwhile attempting escape. Some shot in full view of West Germans\npowerless to help them. The wall stabilized East Germany's economy\nby preventing its work force from leaving, but tarnished its reputation, becoming a global symbol \nof Communist repression. As part of reconciliation with the East, the Basic Treaty of 1972 recognized\nEast Germany pragmatically while West Germany retained its hope\nfor eventual reunification. Although the Eastern regime\ngradually allowed family visits, it tried to discourage people\nfrom exercising these rights with an arduous bureaucratic process\nand high fees. Nonetheless, it was still overwhelmed\nby applications. By the end of the 1980's, the liberalization of \nother Eastern Bloc regimes caused mass demonstrations\nfor free travel and demands for democracy. On the evening of November 9, 1989, East Germany tried to defuse tension\nby making travel permits easier to obtain. But the announcement brought thousands\nof East Berliners to the border crossing points in the wall, forcing the surprised guards to open\nthe gates immediately. Rejoicing crowds poured into West Berlin as people from both sides danced \natop the wall. And others began to demolish it \nwith whatever tools they could find. Although the border guards initially\ntried to maintain order, it was soon clear that the years\nof division were at an end. After four decades, Germany was\nofficially reunified in October 1990. And the Soviet Union fell soon after. Today, parts of the wall still \nstand as a reminder that any barriers we put up \nto impede freedom, we can also break down."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Cold War was a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Competition for the discovery of the North Pole"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Struggle between the Free World and Communism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Conflict between the Soviet Union and China"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Clash between Cuba and the United States"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The Wall was built to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Keep the Western spies out"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Prevent flooding in the former German capital"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Keep East Germans from leaving their country"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Show the West its impotence"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The East Germans wanted to leave:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because of the bad climate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Due to the outdated rock music"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Since they lacked work"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To improve their standard of living"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The Berlin Wall:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Helped stabilize the Communist government"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cut off West Berliners from their hinterland"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Provided a canvas for Western graffiti artists"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Was a training ground for mountain climbers"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The Wall fell because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "President Reagan demanded it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Secretary General Gorbachev allowed it"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The people of East Berlin rose up and smashed it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The many tunnels under it made it collapse"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 31, "lesson": 3, "title": "Why a total solar eclipse is such a big deal", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/buvIESK0", "transcript": {"en": "A solar eclipse happens when the moon’s\nshadow falls somewhere on the surface of Earth And a lunar eclipse is the opposite -- when\nthe Earth’s shadow falls on the moon The two sections of the shadow, the dark umbra\nand the partially shaded penumbra, their placement determines which type of eclipse\nwe can see from Earth. But not all eclipses are made equal. The most spectacular, the one for your bucket\nlist is a total eclipse of the sun. A total solar eclipse begins as a partial\neclipse. You’ll notice trees projecting the crescent\nsun, and shadows becoming sharper than normal. The landscape darkens to a bluish-grey and\n you’ll start to feel the temperature drop. From the west, the moon’s shadow rushes\ntoward you like a silent storm. Look up and you’ll see the last sliver of\nthe sun sparkling like a diamond ring, before it’s broken into a string of beads\nby the moon’s rough terrain. Now you can see the pearly glow of the sun’s\ncorona and the pink and red light from the hydrogen gas of the chromosphere. Together these make up the sun’s outer atmosphere,\nand a total solar eclipse is the only occasion you have to lay eyes on it. This is totality and if you get a chance\nto see it, you should. The moon orbits earth every 29.5 days, but\nwe don’t get eclipses every month. That’s because the moon’s orbit is not\nin line with earth’s orbit. it’s tilted about 5 degrees. That doesn’t seem like much but keep in\nmind that the scale of the model we’re showing to you is way off. If the Earth and moon are this size, the\ndistance between them should be around 10 ft. At this distance, 5 degrees is enough to keep\nthe moon’s shadow off of Earth and the Earth’s shadow off the moon most months. So why do we ever get eclipses? Because there are two points where the moon’s\norbit crosses the sun’s plane, called nodes. And as the Earth moves along its annual orbit,\nthose points line up with the sun about twice a year. As the moon passes between the sun and Earth\nat that time, we get a solar eclipse. When it’s behind Earth at that time, we\nget a lunar eclipse. There are a ton of orbital quirks that make\npredicting eclipses really complicated, but in general we’ll have a few solar and lunar\neclipses of some sort and a few lunar eclipses of some sort every year. But you’re more likely to see a total lunar\neclipse in your lifetime than a total solar one. The totality of a lunar eclipse can last well\nover an hour and it’s viewable for anyone on the night side of earth. The moon often turns red during a total lunar\neclipse because our planet’s atmosphere scatters the shorter bluer wavelengths of\nlight, while the longer, redder wavelengths pass through. Or to put it another way, a total lunar eclipse\nprojects all of the world’s sunsets and sunrises onto the moon. Total solar eclipses seem much more rare because\ntotality lasts just a few minutes, and although Earth gets a total solar eclipse every 18\nmonths on average, each one is only viewable by less than half a percent of Earth’s surface. Eclipse chasers travel all over the world\nto put themselves in the path of the shadow. In a total solar eclipse, the moon precisely\ncovers the sun from the vantage point of some place on Earth. This is possible because by coincidence, the\nsun and the moon appear to be about the same size in our sky. While the sun is 400 times bigger than the\nmoon, it’s also about 400 times farther away. But this alignment isn’t constant. the moon has an elliptical orbit. Its size varies about 12% throughout a month. When it’s closer to us, we can get total\nsolar eclipses, but less than 30% of solar eclipses are total. More often, we get partial eclipses, where\nthe alignment is a bit off, or annular eclipses, where the moon is too far away to fully block\nthe sun, leaving a ring of sunlight around the moon. In the far future, earth will only get annular\nand partial solar eclipses because our moon is moving further away. We know that because Buzz Aldrin and Neil\nArmstrong left mirrors on the moon in 1969. Astronomers bounce lasers off those mirrors\nto measure the moon’s distance. And that’s how they found out that the moon\nis moving away from Earth by more than 3 cm per year. So in a billion years or so, whatever creatures\nlive here will witness Earth’s very last total solar eclipse. “We can see on the Radio One screen, a fantastic\ntotal solar eclipse taken from the pictures above the clouds.” “This is just fantastic.” A lot of early civilizations feared eclipses. They were often seen as an attack on the sun\nor moon by the forces of darkness. But now that we understand our place in space,\neclipses are an occasion for awe, and for gratitude. All over the galaxy rocks are casting shadows\non other rocks. But only here, as far as we know, is there\nsomeone to notice them."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "During an eclipse, what causes the pearly chain of light around the moon before the glow of the sun's corona?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the moon's rough terrain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "water in the atmosphere"}, {"label": "C", "text": "solar flares"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "By how much are the orbits of Earth and the moon separated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1.5 degrees"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5 degrees"}, {"label": "C", "text": "12 degrees"}, {"label": "D", "text": "21 degrees"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "During an eclipse, what causes the pearly chain of light around the moon before the glow of the sun's corona?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the moon's rough terrain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "water in the atmosphere"}, {"label": "C", "text": "solar flares"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "By how much are the orbits of Earth and the moon separated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1.5 degrees"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5 degrees"}, {"label": "C", "text": "12 degrees"}, {"label": "D", "text": "21 degrees"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

The cod population off Canada's East Coast\ncollapsed in the 1990s, intense recreational \nand commercial fishing has decimated goliath grouper populations\nin South Florida, and most populations of tuna\nhave plummeted by over 50%, with the Southern Atlantic bluefin\non the verge of extinction. Those are just a couple of many examples. Overfishing is happening \nall over the world. How did this happen? When some people think of fishing, they imagine relaxing in a boat\nand patiently reeling in the day's catch. But modern industrial fishing,\nthe kind that stocks our grocery shelves, looks more like warfare. In fact, the technologies they employ\nwere developed for war. Radar, sonar, helicopters, and spotter planes are all used to guide factory ships\ntowards dwindling schools of fish. Long lines with hundreds\nof hooks or huge nets round up massive amounts of fish,\nalong with other species, like seabirds, turtles, and dolphins. And fish are hauled up onto giant boats, complete with onboard flash freezing\nand processing facilities. All of these technologies have enabled\nus to catch fish at greater depths and farther out at sea than ever before. And as the distance and depth\nof fishing have expanded, so has the variety of species we target. For example, the Patagonian toothfish\nneither sounds nor looks very appetizing. And fishermen ignored it until\nthe late 1970s. Then it was rebranded and marketed\nto chefs in the U.S. as Chilean sea bass, despite the animal actually \nbeing a type of cod. Soon it was popping up in markets\nall over the world and is now a delicacy. Unfortunately, these deep water fish \ndon't reproduce until they're at least ten years old, making them extremely vulnerable\nto overfishing when the young are caught before they've\nhad the chance to spawn. Consumer taste and prices can\nalso have harmful effects. For example, shark fin soup is considered\nsuch a delicacy in China and Vietnam that the fin has become \nthe most profitable part of the shark. This leads many fishermen to fill\ntheir boats with fins leaving millions of dead sharks behind. The problems aren't unique\nto toothfish and sharks. Almost 31% of the world's fish populations\nare overfished, and another 58% are fished\nat the maximum sustainable level. Wild fish simply can't reproduce\nas fast as 7 billion people can eat them. Fishing also has impacts\non broader ecosystems. Wild shrimp are typically caught by\ndragging nets the size of a football field along the ocean bottom, disrupting or destroying\nseafloor habitats. The catch is often as little as 5% shrimp. The rest is by-catch, unwanted \nanimals that are thrown back dead. And coastal shrimp farming isn't\nmuch better. Mangroves are bulldozed to make room\nfor shrimp farms, robbing coastal communities of storm\nprotection and natural water filtration and depriving fish of key\nnursery habitats. So what does it look like to give\nfish a break and let them recover? Protection can take many forms. In national waters,\ngovernments can set limits about how, when, where, \nand how much fishing occurs, with restrictions on certain \nboats and equipment. Harmful practices, such as bottom \ntrawling, can be banned altogether, and we can establish marine reserves\nclosed to all fishing to help ecosystems restore themselves. There's also a role for consumer awareness\nand boycotts to reduce wasteful practices, like shark finning, and push fishing industries towards\nmore sustainable practices. Past interventions have successfully\nhelped depleted fish populations recover. There are many solutions. The best approach for each fishery\nmust be considered based on science, respect for the local communities\nthat rely on the ocean, and for fish as wild animals. And then the rules must be enforced. International collaboration is often\nneeded, too, because fish don't care about our borders. We need to end overfishing.

{"page": 31, "lesson": 5, "title": "When is water safe to drink? - Mia Nacamulli", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/when-is-water-safe-to-drink-mia-nacamulli", "transcript": {"en": "Take a look at the water in this glass. Refreshing, hydrating, and invaluable\nto your survival. Before you take a sip, though, how do you know that the water inside\nis free from disease-causing organisms and pollutants? One out of ten people in the world\ncan't actually be sure that their water is clean \nand safe to drink. Why is that? Inadequate sanitation, poor protection of drinking water sources, and improper hygiene often lead to sewage \nand feces-contaminated water. That's the ideal breeding ground\nfor dangerous bacteria, viruses, and parasites. And the effects of these pathogens\nare staggering. Diarrheal disease from unsafe water is one\nof the leading causes of death around the world for children under five. And according to a U.N. report from 2010, microbial water-borne illnesses killed\nmore people per year than war. Proper treatment processes, though,\ncan address these threats. They usually have three parts: sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. Once water has been collected\nin a treatment facility, it's ready for cleaning. The first step, sedimentation,\njust takes time. The water sits undisturbed, allowing\nheavier particles to sink to the bottom. Often, though, particles \nare just too small to be removed by sedimentation alone and need to be filtered. Gravity pulls the water downward through\nlayers of sand that catch leftover particles \nin their pores, prepping the water \nfor its final treatment, a dose of disinfectant. Chemicals, primarily forms \nof chlorine and ozone, are mixed in to kill off any pathogens and to disinfect pipes \nand storage systems. Chlorine is highly effective in destroying\nwater's living organisms, but its use remains government-regulated because it has potentially harmful\nchemical byproducts. And if an imbalance of chlorine occurs\nduring the disinfection process, it can trigger other chemical reactions. For example, \nlevels of chlorine byproducts, like trihalomethanes, could skyrocket,\nleading to pipe corrosion and the release of iron, copper,\nand lead into drinking water. Water contamination from these\nand other sources including leaching, chemical spills, and runoffs, has been linked \nto long-term health effects, like cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and miscarriage. Unfortunately, analyzing the exact risks of chemically contaminated \nwater is difficult. So while it's clear that disinfectants\nmake us safer by removing disease-causing pathogens, experts have yet \nto determine the full scope of how the chemical cocktail \nin our drinking water really impacts human health. So how can you tell whether the water\nyou have access to, whether from a tap or otherwise, is drinkable? Firstly, too much turbidity, trace organic compounds, or high-density heavy metals like arsenic,\nchromium, or lead, mean that the water \nis unsuitable for consumption. A lot of contaminants, \nlike lead or arsenic, won't be obvious without tests, but some clues, like cloudiness, brown or yellow coloration, a foul odor, or an excessive chlorine smell can indicate the need \nto investigate further. Water testing kits can go a step further and confirm the presence of many different\ncontaminants and chemicals. With many types of contamination, there are ways of treating water where \nit's used instead of close to its source. Point-of-use treatment has actually\nbeen around for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians boiled away many\norganic contaminants with the sun's heat. And in Ancient Greece, Hippocrates\ndesigned a bag that trapped bad tasting \nsediments from water. Today, point-of-use processes usually\ninvolve ionization to lower mineral content. They also use adsorption filtration, where a porous material\ncalled activated carbon strains the water to remove contaminants\nand chemical byproducts. While it's not always an effective\nlong-term solution, point-of-use treatment is portable,\neasy to install, and adaptable. And in regions where large-scale\nsystems are unavailable, or where water has been contaminated\nfurther along its journey, these systems can mean the difference\nbetween life and death.

Butterflies get all the glory, fluttering\naround with their flashy looks. But caterpillars? They’re more than just an awkward adolescent\nphase. They do all the hard work, so that one day\nthey can look like this. As adults, butterflies really only have one\njob: mating. They’re basically flying reproduction machines,\npowered by sugar water. Their proboscis is made for sipping nectar. But that liquid diet doesn’t give them much\nof the protein they need to make eggs. So that hungry, hungry caterpillar has a big\njob to do. It’s not just eating for itself. It’s stockpiling the protein it will need\nlater on to make the next generation. It starts by eating its way out of the egg. No leftovers. Then it’s onto the main course. These pipevine swallowtail caterpillars are\nchowing down on their favorite – and only – food: the pipevine. For a monarch caterpillar, it’s all about\nthe milkweed. In two weeks they’ll grow 20 times longer. That’s like a human baby growing as tall\nas a three-story building. A caterpillar can’t see very well. So it uses antennae to smell for food. Not those big ones on top – those are for\nfeeling around. It’s the tiny ones right down there. It eats and eats and eats… storing up as\nmuch protein as possible. Leaves are about one quarter protein. After packing on the pounds for a couple of\nweeks, this monarch caterpillar is finally ready for the big day. It weaves a ball of silk on a branch. Then, it hooks onto it – with its backside. And lets go. Look through its skin. There’s something wiggling in there. The caterpillar pumps and pushes. Until… it splits open… shedding all traces of its youth… including its face. The outer skin hardens into the chrysalis\nthat protects the pupa inside. Its stomach shrinks. It’s giving up its gluttonous ways. When the butterfly emerges days later, it\nuncurls its brand new proboscis – two pieces called galeae that have to be zipped together\ninto a single straw before the butterfly can use it. And it lets those glorious wings unfold. They’ll take it to find mates and a juicy\nnew plant to lay its eggs on, using that stored up protein. This complete metamorphosis is called holometaboly. Multiple lives in a single life. It takes a lot of work. And butterflies only live a few weeks. But this strategy is not as rare as you might\nthink. In the animal kingdom, it’s incredibly common. Mammals like us are the weird ones. After all, our face doesn't fall off when\nwe grow up. Hey! It’s Lauren. Can you spot the chrysalises hanging on this\nbranch? They need that camouflage.

Could a baseball transform into\nsomething like a radio wave, travel through buildings, bounce around corners, and change back into a baseball? Oddly enough, thanks to quantum mechanics,\nthe answer might actually be yes. Sort of. Here's the trick. The baseball itself couldn't \nbe sent by radio, but all the information about it could. In quantum physics, atoms and electrons are interpreted as a collection\nof distinct properties, for example, position, momentum, and intrinsic spin. The values of these properties \nconfigure the particle, giving it a quantum state identity. If two electrons have \nthe same quantum state, they're identical. In a literal sense, our baseball\nis defined by a collective quantum state resulting from its many atoms. If this quantum state information\ncould be read in Boston and sent around the world, atoms for the same chemical elements\ncould have this information imprinted on them in Bangalore and be carefully directed to assemble, becoming the exact same baseball. There's a wrinkle though. Quantum states aren't so easy to measure. The uncertainty principle \nin quantum physics implies the position and momentum\nof a particle can't be measured at the same time. The simplest way to measure\nthe exact position of an electron requires scattering a particle of light,\na photon, from it, and collecting the light in a microscope. But that scattering changes the momentum\nof the electron in an unpredictable way. We lose all previous information\nabout momentum. In a sense, \nquantum information is fragile. Measuring the information changes it. So how can we transmit something we're not permitted to fully read\nwithout destroying it? The answer can be found in the strange\nphenomena of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is an old mystery\nfrom the early days of quantum physics and it's still not entirely understood. Entangling the spin of two electrons\nresults in an influence that transcends distance. Measuring the spin of the first electron determines what spin will \nmeasure for the second, whether the two particles are a mile\nor a light year apart. Somehow, information \nabout the first electron's quantum state, called a qubit of data, influences its partner without \ntransmission across the intervening space. Einstein and his colleagues called\nthis strange communcation spooky action at a distance. While it does seem that entanglement\nbetween two particles helps transfer a qubit instantaneously\nacross the space between them, there's a catch. This interaction must begin locally. The two electrons must be entangled\nin close proximity before one of them is transported\nto a new site. By itself, quantum entanglement\nisn't teleportation. To complete the teleport, we need a digital message to help\ninterpret the qubit at the receiving end. Two bits of data created by measuring\nthe first particle. These digital bits must be transmitted\nby a classical channel that's limited by the speed of light,\nradio, microwaves, or perhaps fiberoptics. When we measure a particle\nfor this digital message, we destroy its quantum information, which means the baseball must disappear\nfrom Boston for it to teleport to Bangalore. Thanks to the uncertainty principle, teleportation transfers the information\nabout the baseball between the two cities\nand never duplicates it. So in principle, we could teleport \nobjects, even people, but at present, it seems unlikely\nwe can measure the quantum states of the trillion trillion or more atoms\nin large objects and then recreate them elsewhere. The complexity of this task\nand the energy needed is astronomical. For now, we can reliably teleport\nsingle electrons and atoms, which may lead to super-secured\ndata encryption for future quantum computers. The philosophical implications\nof quantum teleportation are subtle. A teleported object doesn't exactly\ntransport across space like tangible matter, nor does it exactly transmit across space,\nlike intangible information. It seems to do a little of both. Quantum physics gives us \na strange new vision for all the matter in our universe\nas collections of fragile information. And quantum teleportation reveals\nnew ways to influence this fragility. And remember, never say never. In a little over a century, mankind has advanced from an uncertain \nnew understanding of the behavior of electrons\nat the atomic scale to reliably teleporting them\nacross a room. What new technical mastery \nof such phenomena might we have in 1,000, \nor even 10,000 years?

Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 There is a pattern here, but it may not be the kind\nof pattern you think it is. Look at the sequence again\nand try reading it aloud. Now, look at the next number\nin the sequence. 3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1. Pause again if you'd like to think\nabout it some more. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This is what's known as\na look and say sequence. Unlike many number sequences, this relies not on some mathematical\nproperty of the numbers themselves, but on their notation. Start with the left-most digit\nof the initial number. Now, read out how many times \nit repeats in succession followed by the name of the digit itself. Then move on to the next distinct digit\nand repeat until you reach the end. So the number 1 is read as \"one one\" written down the same way \nwe write eleven. Of course, as part of this sequence,\nit's not actually the number eleven, but 2 ones, which we then write as 2 1. That number is then read out\nas 1 2 1 1, which written out we'd read as\none one, one two, two ones, and so on. These kinds of sequences were first\nanalyzed by mathematician John Conway, who noted they have \nsome interesting properties. For instance, starting with the number 22,\nyields an infinite loop of two twos. But when seeded with any other number, the sequence grows in some\nvery specific ways. Notice that although the number\nof digits keeps increasing, the increase doesn't seem\nto be either linear or random. In fact, if you extend the sequence\ninfinitely, a pattern emerges. The ratio between the amount of digits\nin two consecutive terms gradually converges to a single number\nknown as Conway's Constant. This is equal to a little over 1.3, meaning that the amount of digits\nincreases by about 30% with every step in the sequence. What about the numbers themselves? That gets even more interesting. Except for the repeating sequence of 22, every possible sequence eventually breaks\ndown into distinct strings of digits. No matter what order these strings\nshow up in, each appears unbroken in its entirety\nevery time it occurs. Conway identified 92 of these elements, all composed only of digits 1, 2, and 3, as well as two additional elements whose variations\ncan end with any digit of 4 or greater. No matter what number the sequence\nis seeded with, eventually, it'll just consist\nof these combinations, with digits 4 or higher only appearing\nat the end of the two extra elements, if at all. Beyond being a neat puzzle, the look and say sequence\nhas some practical applications. For example, run-length encoding, a data compression that was once used for\ntelevision signals and digital graphics, is based on a similar concept. The amount of times a data value repeats\nwithin the code is recorded as a data value itself.

This gas was likely formed \nover millions of years as layers of decaying organisms\nwere exposed to intense heat and pressure under the Earth's crust. There's a technology called\nhydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that can extract this natural gas, potentially powering us\nfor decades to come. So how does fracking work, and why it is a source \nof such heated controversy? A fracking site can be anywhere\nwith natural gas, from a remote desert to several hundred feet\nfrom your backyard. It starts out with a long vertical hole\nknown as a wellbore drilled down through layers of sediment. When the well reaches 2500 - 3000 meters,\nit's at its kickoff point where it can begin the process\nof horizontal drilling. It turns 90 degrees and extends\nhorizontally for about 1.5 kilometers through a compressed black layer\ncalled the shale rock formation. A specialized perforating gun\nis then lowered and fired, creating a series of small, \ninch-long holes that burst through the well's casing\ninto the rock layer. About three to four months\nafter the initial drilling, the well is ready for fracking to begin. Fracking fluid is pumped down\ninto the well at a pressure so high, it cracks the shale rock, creating fractures through which\nthe trapped gas and oil can escape. The fluid itself is more than 90% water. The rest is made up of concentrated\nchemical additives. These vary depending on the specific\ncharacteristics of the fracking site, but usually fall into three categories: acids for clearing debris\nand dissolving minerals, friction-reducing compounds to create a slippery form of water \nknown as slickwater, and disinfectant to prevent\nbacteria growth. Sand or clay is also mixed into\nthe water to prop open the fissures so the gas and oil can keep leaking out,\neven after the pressure is released. It's estimated that all of fracking's\nintense pumping and flushing uses an average of 3-6 million gallons\nof water per well. That's actually not a lot compared\nto agriculture, power plants, or even golf course maintenance, but it can have a notable impact\non local water supply. And disposing of used fracking water\nis also an issue. Along with the trapped gas\nthat's pumped up to the surface, millions of gallons of flow-back liquid\ncome gushing up. This liquid containing contaminants\nlike radioactive material, salts, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons, needs to be stored and disposed of. That's usually done in pits on-site\nin deep wells or off-site at water treatment facilities. Another option is to recycle\nthe flow-back liquid, but the recycling process can actually\nincrease levels of contamination since the water is more toxic\nwith each use. Wells are typically encased \nin steel and cement to prevent contaminants from leaking\ninto groundwater. But any negligence \nor fracking-related accidents can have devastating effects. Fracturing directly \ninto underground water hazardous underground \nseepage and leakage, and inadequate treatment and disposal\nof highly-toxic waste water can potentially contaminate\ndrinking water around a fracking site. There's also concern about\nthe threat of earthquakes and damaged infrastructure from pressure \nand waste water injection. Links between fracking\nand increased seismic activity leave unresolved questions\nabout long-term pressure imbalances that might be happening\ndeep beneath our feet. Fracking's biggest controversy, though,\nis happening above the ground. The general consensus is that burning\nnatural gas is better for the environment than burning coal since the gas collected from fracking emits only half \nthe carbon dioxide as coal per unit of energy. The pollution caused \nby the fracking itself, though, isn't negligible. Methane that leaks out during the drilling\nand pumping process is many times more potent\nthan carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Some scientists argue that methane\neventually dissipates, so has a relatively low long-term impact. But a greater question hangs in the air. Does fracking take time,\nmoney, and research away from the development\nof cleaner renewable energy sources? Natural gas is non-renewable, and the short-run economic interests\nsupporting fracking may fall short in the face\nof global climate change. Experts are still examining\nfracking's overarching effects. Although modern fracking has been\naround since the 1940s, it's boomed in the last few decades. As other sources of natural gas decrease,\nthe costs of non-renewable energies rise, and cutting-edge technologies\nmake it so accessible. But many countries and regions\nhave already banned fracking in response to environmental concerns. It's undeniable that fracking has reshaped\nthe energy landscape around the world, but for what long-term benefit\nand at what cost?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "An increase in seismic activity in areas where fracking has occurred may be due to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wastewater injection"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pressure imbalances"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The heavy equipment that is needed to perform fracking"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wastewater injection and pressure imbalances"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What causes the formation of natural gas from layers of decaying organisms?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pressure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The addition of water"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Heat and Pressure"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The point at which horizontal drilling begins is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Right below the surface"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Called the kickoff point"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Where the drillers hit natural gas"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Located at the point where soil ends and bedrock begins"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What causes the “fracking” of the shale rock?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The drill itself"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Earthquakes from the heavy machinery"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The high pressure of fracking fluid"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the estimated amount of water used when fracking a natural gas well?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "300-600 gallons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3000-6000 gallons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3-6 gallons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3,000,000-6,000,000 gallons"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

They can spend up to half their waking hours\ngrooming. Their tongue is covered in tiny spines. They’re what makes the tongue feel so sandpapery. These spines, called papillae, are made of\nkeratin, just like their claws and our fingernails. The papillae even look like miniature cat\nclaws. They do an impeccable job of detangling their\nfur. Researchers at Georgia Tech made a 3D model\nof a cat’s tongue… to test how it works. See how the fur just peels off? It’s because the spines are all angled in\nthe same direction. With a typical hairbrush, you’d have to\npick the fur out from between the bristles. So why are cats so preoccupied with grooming? For them, it’s about more than just vanity. For one thing, it’s a way to show affection--\nto build bonds. That’s why they appreciate us petting them. And it spreads out oils produced by the cat’s\nskin that gives their fur some water resistance. But when it really comes down to it, for cats,\nstaying clean is a matter of life and death. Cats are carnivores… ambush predators. They hide and sneak up on their unsuspecting\nprey. One whiff of the wrong odor could give the\ncat away. But when they pounce, it’s their bite that\nfinishes the job. Cats have extra-wide mouths so they can get\ntheir teeth around their prey’s neck. It would be like having the corners of your\nmouth go all the way back by your ears. But there’s a tradeoff that comes with that\nbig bite.

How does this work in practice? In 1932, Raymond Loewy presented a train design to Pennsylvania Railroad. His big idea was a single, sleek shell for the train the shape of a long bullet. But his initial design was met with great skepticism, so he decided to introduce the idea in stages. His came back with a version that was only slightly more advanced than Thomas the Tank Engine. But his next design was more advanced, and then more advanced... until he finally persuaded the train executives that his original, advanced version was acceptable. This is the MAYA method. He made the surprising feel familiar. There’s scientific evidence to back up these claims. One of the sturdiest findings in psychological history is known as the “mere-exposure” effect. In the 1960s, the psychologist Robert Zajonc conducted an experiment where he showed subjects nonsense words, random shapes, and Chinese characters, and asked participants to pick their favorites. The subjects consistently chose the shapes and words that they'd seen the most. Exposure leads to familiarity and familiarity leads to subconscious preference. There’s even an explanation from evolutionary psychology: If you're a hunter/gatherer trawling a Savannah of Africa and you see a plant or an animal that you recognize, that's a good sign that it hasn't killed you … at least not yet. So we have the “acceptable” part of Raymond Loewy’s theory -- that people naturally gravitate towards familiarity. But what about the “advanced” aspect? There is another powerful idea in psychology called habituation. That means, people get tired of having to see the same thing over and over again, like a vampire movie. The power of familiarity fails when people feel like they are being forced to confront it. Like having to hear that Ed Sheeran song for the one-thousandth time. No! And for that reason, the power of familiarity seems to be strongest when a person is least expecting it. A case study is Spotify’s Discover Weekly\nfeature. Spotify delivers a personalized playlist of 30 new songs every Monday to its users. Initially, the feature was supposed to include entirely new music by new artists. A bug in the algorithm accidentally let through songs that users had already heard before. So, engineers fixed the bug. And to their astonishment, engagement with the feature collapsed. They realized that people trusted new songs when they recognized old ones. To enjoy the surprising music, they needed a dash of the familiar. Raymond Loewy understood combining the new and the old intuitively. One of his last assignments was to help NASA design the interior of one of it's first space stations: Sky Lab. He added creature comforts, like a shower and a dining room table. But his most ingenious idea was to add a small window. A viewing portal of planet Earth. You have surely seen this viewing portal -- it’s in almost every movie about astronauts and space. It’s the perfect manifestation of MAYA: a window to a new world can also show you home.

How can various compounds impact the way\nwe physically feel, think, and even behave? For the most part, this depends on\nhow a drug alters the communication between cells in the brain. There are a number of different ways\nthat can happen. But before it gets into the brain, any drug must first reach the bloodstream on a journey that can take anywhere\nfrom seconds to hours, depending on factors like how\nit's administered. The slowest method is to take\na drug orally because it must be absorbed by\nour digestive system before it takes effect. Inhaling a drug gets it into\nthe bloodstream faster. And injecting a drug intravenously\nworks quickly too because it pumps the chemicals directly\ninto the blood. Once there, the drug quickly reaches\nthe gates of its destination, the brain. The entrance to this organ is guarded\nby the blood-brain barrier, which separates blood \nfrom the nervous system to keep potentially dangerous \nsubstances out. So all drugs must have a specific\nchemical composition which gives them the key to unlock\nthis barrier and pass through. Once inside, drugs start to interfere\nwith the brain's normal functioning by targeting its web of neurons \nand synapses. Neurons are brain cells that have\na nucleus, dendrites, and an axon. Synapses are structures placed along\nthe dendrites or the axon which allow the exchange of \nelectrochemical signals between neurons. Those signals take the form of chemicals\ncalled neurotransmitters. Each neurotransmitter plays different\nroles in regulating our behaviors, emotions, and cognition. But they all work in one of two ways. They can either inhibit \nthe receiving neuron, limiting its activity, or excite it, creating a new electrochemical signal\nthat spreads throughout the network. Any leftover neurotransmitter usually\ngets degraded or reabsorbed \ninto the transmitting neuron. A drug's effectiveness stems \nfrom its ability to manipulate these synaptic transmissions\nat different phases of the process. That results in an increase or a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitters\nbeing spread. For instance, common antidepressants,\nlike SSRIs, stop the reabsorption of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that modulates\nour moods. This effectively pushes more of it\ninto the neural network. Meanwhile, painkillers, like morphine, raise levels of serotonin \nand noradrenaline, which regulate energy, arousal, alertness, and pleasure. Those same neurotransmitters also\naffect endorphin receptors, reducing pain perception. And tranquilizers works by increasing\nthe production of GABA to inhibit neural activity putting the person in a relaxed\nor sedated state. What about illegal or elicit drugs? These have powerful impacts on the brain\nthat we're still trying to understand. Crystal meth, an amphetamine, induces a long-lasting release\nof dopamine, a neurotransmitter linked with\nthe perception of reward and pleasure. It also activates noradrenaline receptors, which increases the heart rate, dilates pupils, and triggers the body's fight\nor flight response. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine\nand serotonin, pushing more into the network where they boost energy, create feelings of euphoria, and suppress appetites. And hallucinogenic drugs have some\nof the most puzzling effects. Substances like LSD, mescaline, and DMT all block the release of serotonin, which regulates mood and impulsivity. They also have an impact \non the neural circuits involved in perception, learning,\nand behavioral regulation, which may explain why these drugs\nhave such powerful impacts. Even if some of these \neffects sound exciting, there are reasons why some of these drugs\nare highly controlled and often illegal. Drugs have the power to alter \nthe brain's chemistry, and repeated use can permanently\nrewire the neural networks that support our ability to think, make decisions, learn, and remember things. There's a lot we still don't know \nabout drugs and their effects, both the good and the bad. But those we do know about are the ones\nwe've studied closely, and turned into effective medicines.

Buoyant, and you've agreed to transport\nseveral tanks containing the last specimens of a critically\nendangered fish species to their new aquarium. Unfortunately, as you're passing\nthrough shark-infested waters, the boat is battered by a fierce storm,\nthrowing your precious cargo overboard. And to make matters worse, no one seems certain\njust how many fish tanks are missing. Fortunately, you have a rescue sub\nat your disposal, but only enough fuel for one trip\nto the ocean floor. You need to know where the tanks are so you can gather them all\nin one quick pass. Not a single fish can be lost. You decide to scan the three sectors\nof the ocean floor where the cargo could have landed. Thermal imaging shows 50 organisms\nin the area, and you quickly realize that that number\nincludes both your fish and some ravenous sharks. You flip on the sonar \nto get a better look. The image for Sector Alpha shows\nfour tanks and two sharks, the image for Sector Beta shows\ntwo tanks and four sharks, and the image for Sector Gamma\nis blank. Your sonar has malfunctioned, and you're going to have to go\nwith the info you have. You check the shipping notes, but all you learn is that each tank\nhad the same number of fish inside. The cargo hold had space for anywhere\nfrom 1 to 13 total tanks. And finally, the old captain tells you\nthat this area has the odd property that no two sectors can have the same\nnumber of sharks, but every sector will have at least one, and no more than seven. There's no time to waste. The tanks won't withstand the pressure\nmuch longer. As you descend in the sub,\nyou review everything you know. How many fish tanks do you need\nto find in Sector Gamma? Hurry, the fate of an entire species\ndepends on you. Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 At first, it seems like there are just\ntoo many missing pieces of information. After all, you don't know how many fish\nor how many tanks there are, let alone how many fish are in each one. But then you remember the best way to compare multiple pieces \nof partial information - a table. Since we know there are thirteen\ntanks at most, and we already see six tanks\nin Sectors Alpha and Beta, we know the total number of tanks\nmust be between 6 and 13. We also know that each sector has \na different amount of sharks with no more than seven in each one. Since there are two in Sector Alpha\nand four in Sector Beta, Sector Gamma can have \n1, 3, 5, 6, or 7 sharks. What about the number of endangered fish? Out of the 50 total organisms\nin all three sectors, we know at least seven are sharks, leaving a maximum of 43 fish\ninside all the tanks. And the more sharks we find in Sector 3,\nthe fewer fish there are to save. Now, remember that the fish are\nequally distributed across all the tanks. Why is that important? Because it means that one of the possible\nvalues for the total amount of fish must be divisible by one of the possible\nvalues for the total amount of tanks. And looking at the table, we can see\nthat the only combination that works is 39 fish divided between 13 tanks\nwith three fish in each. With sharks swarming around, you quickly pilot the sub through\nthe first two sectors before retrieving the remaining\nseven tanks in Sector Gamma.

{"page": 31, "lesson": 14, "title": "What Does Lead Poisoning Do To Your Brain?", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/AoyOGngz", "transcript": {"en": "Lead is a sneaky little element. It’s malleable and durable, so it’s no\nwonder that for years we used it in piping and added it to paint. But it’s also extremely poisonous. It can create problems all over the body—from\nrashes, to abdominal pain, to anemia. But the most serious effects occur in the\nbrain—and especially in the brains of children. It can cause headaches, memory loss, learning\ndisabilities, behavioral issues, and seizures. And kids don’t even have to be exposed directly. Women who wind up ingesting lead can store\nit in their bones. And if they get pregnant, that lead can be\npassed on and damage the brains of their children. Lead poisoning is still a big problem in the\nUS today—and not just in communities you may have heard of, like Flint, Michigan. So, what’s actually happening to the brain\nwhen you have lead poisoning? And is there anything we can do to stop it? I’m Anna and this is Gross Science. Lead messes with our brains in a few different\nways. But to understand what they are, let’s look\nreally quickly at how brain cells—or neurons—communicate: and I promise, this will be short, sweet,\nand hopefully deeply enlightening. Ok, so neurons have a long tail called an\n“axon” at one end, and branch-like structures called “dendrites” at the other. They talk to one another when the axon from\none cell sends chemical signals to another cell’s dendrites. The receiving cell can then pass the message\non to yet another neuron. And all that communicating happens in this\ntiny gap between the cells called the “synapse.” One thing lead can do is block those chemical\nsignals from being sent, which sounds bad enough. But, lead does another thing that can have\neven more long-term effects. It can make the synapse—that connection\nbetween your neurons—become weaker over time. You see, in order for neurons to maintain\na strong connection, the axon needs to know that the dendrite is receiving its messages. So the dendrite produces a molecule that lets\nthe axon know it’s being heard loud and clear. That molecule is called BDNF, and you can\nkind of think of it like the best-friends molecule. It makes the axon and dendrite’s relationship\neven stronger. But, in order for the cell to produce BDNF,\nit needs calcium. Calcium usually enters the dendrite through\nchannels, which act like a door that opens for a little while when a signal is received. When the door’s unlocked by the right set\nof molecules, calcium flows through freely. But when lead’s present, it jams the door,\npreventing calcium from entering and keeping BDNF from being made. That means that the connections between brain\ncells start to wither. In adults, having poor connections between\nyour neurons is harmful enough. But in children, with their fast growing brains,\nit’s especially dangerous—not to mention that the amount of lead needed to cause brain\ndamage in kids is much smaller, in part because their brains are making (and removing) new\nconnections at much faster rates. Sadly, in the past there haven’t been great\ntreatments for lead poisoning—and especially not for its effects on the brain. But recently, scientists have shown that simply\nby adding a BDNF substitute, neurons may be able to bounce back. Here’s a video showing this process in action. On the left are normal cells, in the middle\nare cells exposed to lead, and on the right are cells exposed to lead that have been given\nBDNF. When the green dye disappears, it means that\nthe neurons are able to send their chemical signals—so when the video turns black you\nknow everything’s working properly. You can see that the green starts to disappear\nin the cells with additional BDNF, even though they’ve been exposed to lead. Now, we’re still far from using BDNF as\na cure for lead poisoning—this isn’t even being tested on humans yet. Certainly, preventing the exposure to lead\nin the first place should be the primary goal. But this research offers hope that one day,\nlead poisoning may be much more treatable. And that’s a great thing, since today, at\nleast 4 million American households with kids are exposed to high levels of lead. And that’s gross.

And why? - Breeanna Elliott", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/who-built-great-zimbabwe-and-why-breeanna-elliott", "transcript": {"en": "Stretched across a tree-peppered expanse\nin southern Africa lies the magnificent ruins\nof Great Zimbabwe, a medieval stone city of astounding\nwealth and prestige. Located in the present-day country\nof Zimbabwe, it's the sight of the largest known\nsettlement ruins in Sub-Saharan Africa, second on the continent only\nto the pyramids of Egypt. But the history of this city\nis shrouded in controversy, defined by decades of dispute\nabout who built it and why. Its name comes from the Shona word\nmadzimbabwe, meaning big house of stone for its unscalable stone walls\nthat reach heights of nearly ten meters and run for a length of about 250 meters. For its grandeur \nand historical significance, it was named a UNESCO \nWorld Heritage site in 1986. Back in the 14th and 15th centuries,\nit was a thriving city. Spread across nearly eight \nsquare-kilometers, Great Zimbabwe was defined by\nthree main areas: the Hill Complex, where the king lived; the Great Enclosure, reserved for\nmembers of the royal family; and the Valley Complex, \nwhere regular citizens lived. Rulers were both powerful economic\nand religious leaders for the region. At its highest point, the city had a bustling urban population \nof 18,000 people and was one of the major African \ntrade centers at the time. What enabled this growth \nwas Great Zimbabwe's influential role in an intercontinental trade network. Connected to several key city-states\nalong the East African Swahili Coast, it was part of the larger Indian Ocean\ntrade routes. The city generated its riches \nby controlling the sources and trade of the most prized items: gold, ivory, and copper. With this mercantile power, it was able\nto extend its sphere of influence across continents, fostering a strong Arab and Indian\ntrader presence throughout its zenith. Archaeologists have since pieced together\nthe details of this history through artifacts discovered on site. There were pottery shards\nand glassworks from Asia, as well as coins minted in the coastal\ntrading city of Kilwa Kisiwani over 1,500 miles away. They also found soapstone bird figures, which are thought to represent\neach of the city's rulers, and young calf bones,\nonly unearthed near the royal residence, show how the diet of the elite\ndiffered from the general population. These clues have also led to theories\nabout the city's decline. By the mid-15th century, the buildings at Great Zimbabwe\nwere almost all that remained. Archaeological evidence points\nto overcrowding and sanitation issues as the cause, compounded by soil depletion\ntriggered by overuse. Eventually, as crops withered\nand conditions in the city worsened, the population of Great Zimbabwe\nis thought to have dispersed and formed the nearby Mutapa\nand Torwa states. Centuries later, a new phase\nof Great Zimbabwe's influence began to play out in the political realm as people debated who had built\nthe famous city of stone. During the European \ncolonization of Africa, racist colonial officials claimed \nthe ruins couldn't be of African origin. So, without a detailed written \nrecord on hand, they instead relied on myths to explain\nthe magnificence of Great Zimbabwe. Some claimed it proved the Bible\nstory of the Queen of Sheba who lived in a city of riches. Others argued it was built by\nthe Ancient Greeks. Then, in the early 20th century\nafter extensive excavation at the site, the archaeologist David Randall-MacIver presented clear evidence \nthat Great Zimbabwe was built by indigenous peoples. Yet, at the time, the country's white \nminority colonial government sought to discredit this theory because it\nchallenged the legitimacy of their rule. In fact, the government actively\nencouraged historians to produce accounts that disputed\nthe city's African origins. Over time, however, an overwhelming\nbody of evidence mounted, identifying Great Zimbabwe as an African\ncity built by Africans. During the 1960s and 70s, Great Zimbabwe became an important symbol \nfor the African Nationalist movement that was spreading across the continent.

You get a lovely break in the elastic\nbands too, which is exciting. This is slice two. Or, it actually is slice two\nwhich has two slices, two parts. So you put this back together.\nAnd we can keep on going. Obviously, I'm going to want to use\nthe elastic band to put the cake... Yeah, That is perfect. That is going to stay\nso fresh for day three. Day three.\nBrady Haran: Actually do day three, Gab. Alex Bellos: Let's turn it around. I think this is going to be the slice\nfor day three.

Such a predicament would make many\npeople despair and curse their awful fate. But for Zeno of Cyprus, it became the\nfoundation of his life's work and legacy. The once wealthy merchant lost everything\nwhen he was shipwrecked in Athens around 300 BCE. With not much else to do,\nhe wandered into a book shop, became intrigued by reading about Socrates, and proceeded to seek out and study\nwith the city's noted philosophers. As Zeno began educating his own students, he originated the philosophy\nknown as Stoicism, whose teachings of virtue, tolerance,\nand self-control have inspired generations of thinkers\nand leaders. The name Stoicism comes \nfrom the Stoa Poikile, the decorated public colonnade where Zeno and his disciples gathered\nfor discussion. Today, we colloquially \nuse the word stoic to mean someone who \nremains calm under pressure and avoids emotional extremes. But while this captures important\naspects of Stoicism, the original philosophy was more\nthan just an attitude. The Stoics believed that \neverything around us operates according \nto a web of cause and effect, resulting in a rational structure\nof the universe, which they called logos. And while we may not always\nhave control over the events affecting us, we can have control over \nhow we approach things. Rather than imagining an ideal society, the Stoic tries to deal \nwith the world as it is while pursuing self-improvement\nthrough four cardinal virtues: practical wisdom, the ability to navigate complex situations\nin a logical, informed, and calm manner; temperance, the exercise of self-restraint \nand moderation in all aspects of life; justice, treating others with fairness even\nwhen they have done wrong; and courage, not just in extraordinary circumstances, but facing daily challenges\nwith clarity and integrity. As Seneca, one of the most famous\nRoman Stoics wrote, \"Sometimes, even to live \nis an act of courage.\" But while Stoicism focuses on \npersonal improvement, it's not a self-centered philosophy. At a time when Roman laws considered\nslaves as property, Seneca called for their humane treatment and stressed that we all share\nthe same fundamental humanity. Nor does Stoicism encourage passivity. The idea is that only people \nwho have cultivated virtue and self-control in themselves\ncan bring positive change in others. One of the most famous Stoic writers\nwas also one of Rome's greatest emperors. Over the course of his 19-year reign, Stoicism gave Marcus Aurelius the resolve\nto lead the Empire through two major wars, while dealing with the loss of many\nof his children. Centuries later, Marcus's journals would\nguide and comfort Nelson Mandela through his 27-year imprisonment during his struggle \nfor racial equality in South Africa. After his release and eventual victory,\nMandela stressed peace and reconciliation, believing that while the injustices\nof the past couldn't be changed, his people could confront them\nin the present and seek to build a better,\nmore just future. Stoicism was an active school \nof philosophy for several centuries in Greece and Rome. As a formal institution, it faded away, but its influence has continued\nto this day. Christian theologians, \nsuch as Thomas Aquinas, have admired and adopted its focus\non the virtues, and there are parallels between\nStoic Ataraxia, or tranquility of mind, and the Buddhist concept of Nirvana. One particularly influential Stoic\nwas the philosopher Epictetus who wrote that suffering stems not from the events in our lives,\nbut from our judgements about them. This has resonated strongly\nwith modern psychology and the self-help movement. For example, rational emotive\nbehavioral therapy focuses on changing \nthe self-defeating attitudes people form about \ntheir life circumstances. There's also Viktor Frankl's logotherapy. Informed by Frankl's own time\nas a concentration camp prisoner, logotherapy is based on \nthe Stoic principle that we can harness our will power\nto fill our lives with meaning, even in the bleakest situations."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is not a Stoic virtue:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Courage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Justice"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Faith"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Temperance"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Around what time was Stoicism founded, by Zeno of Citium?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "700 BCE"}, {"label": "B", "text": "300 BCE"}, {"label": "C", "text": "150 CE"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1450 CE"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the Stoic idea of logos?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The law of universal reason"}, {"label": "B", "text": "What the universe is made of"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It means \"the word\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "One of the Stoic virtues"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following historical figures was not a Stoic?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Epictetus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Seneca"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Marcus Aurelius"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Epicurus"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of these philosophies and schools of personal therapy do not have strong commonalities with Stoicism?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Freudian psychoanalysis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Buddhism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Logotherapy"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

In the process, they uncovered\na number of skeletons. One in particular belonged \nto a wealthy male who lived in the 11th or 12th century and died of leprosy between \nthe ages of 18 and 25. How do we know all this? Simply by examining some old,\nsoil-caked bones? Even centuries after death, skeletons carry unique features\nthat tell us about their identities. And using modern tools and techniques,\nwe can read those features as clues. This is a branch of science known as\nbiological anthropology. It allows researchers to piece together \ndetails about ancient individuals and identify historical events\nthat affected whole populations. When researchers uncover a skeleton, some of the first clues they gather,\nlike age and gender, lie in its morphology, which is the structure, appearance,\nand size of a skeleton. Bones, like the clavicle, \nstop growing at age 25, so a skeleton with a clavicle\nthat hasn't fully formed must be younger than that. Similarly, the plates in the cranium\ncan continue fusing up to age 40, and sometimes beyond. By combining these with some \nmicroscopic skeletal clues, physical anthropologists can estimate\nan approximate age of death. Meanwhile, pelvic bones reveal gender. Biologically, female pelvises are wider,\nallowing women to give birth, where as males are narrower. Bones also betray the signs \nof ancient disease. Disorders like anemia leave their traces\non the bones. And the condition of teeth \ncan reveal clues to factors like diet and malnutrition, which sometimes correlate with wealth\nor poverty. A protein called collagen can give us\neven more profound details. The air we breathe, water we drink, and food we eat leaves permanent traces \nin our bones and teeth in the form of chemical compounds. These compounds contain measurable\nquantities called isotopes. Stable isotopes in bone collagen\nand tooth enamel varies among mammals dependent on where they lived\nand what they ate. So by analyzing these isotopes, we can draw direct inferences regarding \nthe diet and location of historic people. Not only that, but during life, bones undergo a constant cycle\nof remodeling. So if someone moves from one place\nto another, bones synthesized after that move will also reflect the new isotopic \nsignatures of the surrounding environment. That means that skeletons can be used\nlike migratory maps. For instance, between 1-650 AD, the great city of Teotihuacan in Mexico\nbustled with thousands of people. Researchers examined the isotope ratios\nin skeletons' tooth enamel, which held details of their diets\nwhen they were young. They found evidence for significant\nmigration into the city. A majority of the individuals\nwere born elsewhere. With further geological \nand skeletal analysis, they may be able to map where\nthose people came from. That work in Teotihuacan is also\nan example of how bio-anthropologists study skeletons in cemeteries \nand mass graves, then analyze their similarities \nand differences. From that information, they can learn\nabout cultural beliefs, social norms, wars, and what caused their deaths. Today, we use these tools to answer\nbig questions about how forces, like migration and disease, shape the modern world. DNA analysis is even possible in some\nrelatively well-preserved ancient remains. That's helping us understand how diseases\nlike tuberculosis have evolved over the centuries so we can build better treatments\nfor people today. Ancient skeletons can tell us a\nsurprisingly great deal about the past.

This progressive religious movement\nrose in popularity and gained support from some of San Francisco's \nmost prominent politicians. But in 1977, amidst revelations\nof brainwashing and abuse, Jones moved with several hundred followers to establish the commune of Jonestown \nin Guyana. Billed as a utopian paradise,\nthe colony was more like a prison camp, and when a congressional delegation\narrived to investigate its conditions, Jones executed his final plan. On November 18, 1978, 909 men,\nwomen, and children died after being forced to drink \npoisoned Flavor Aid. That grizzly image has since been\nimmortalized as shorthand slang for single-minded cult-like thinking, \"They drank the Kool-aid.\" Today, there are thousands of cults\naround the world. It's important to note two things\nabout them. First, not all cults are religious. Some are political, therapy-based, focused on self-improvement, or otherwise. And on the flip side, not all new religions are what \nwe're referring to as cults. So what exactly defines our modern\nunderstanding of cults, and why do people join them? Broadly speaking, a cult is a group\nor movement with a shared commitment to a usually\nextreme ideology that's typically embodied\nin a charismatic leader. And while few turn out as deadly\nas Jonestown or Heaven's Gate, which ended in a mass suicide \nof 39 people in 1997, most cults share some \nbasic characteristics. A typical cult requires a high level\nof commitment from its members and maintains a strict hierarchy, separating unsuspecting supporters\nand recruits from the inner workings. It claims to provide answers\nto life's biggest questions through its doctrine, along with the required recipe\nfor change that shapes a new member\ninto a true believer. And most importantly, it uses both\nformal and informal systems of influence and control\nto keep members obedient, with little tolerance for internal \ndisagreement or external scrutiny. You might wonder whether \nsome of these descriptions might also apply to established religions. In fact, the world \"cultus\" \noriginally described people who cultivated\nthe worship of certain gods by performing rituals \nand maintaining temples. But in time, it came to mean \nexcessive devotion. Many religions began as cults, but integrated into the fabric\nof the larger society as they grew. A modern cult, by contrast, separates\nits members from others. Rather than providing guidelines\nfor members to live better lives, a cult seeks to directly control them, from personal and family relationships, to financial assets \nand living arrangements. Cults also demand obedience \nto human leaders who tend to be highly persuasive people with authoritarian \nand narcissistic streaks motivated by money, sex, power,\nor all three. While a cult leader uses personal charisma\nto attract initial followers, further expansion works \nlike a pyramid scheme, with early members recruiting new ones. Cults are skilled at knowing \nwhom to target, often focusing on those new to an area, or who have recently undergone some\npersonal or professional loss. Loneliness and a desire for meaning make one susceptible to friendly people\noffering community. The recruitment process can be subtle, sometimes taking months\nto establish a relationship. In fact, more than two-thirds\nof cult members are recruited by a friend, family member, or co-worker whose invitations are harder to refuse. Once in the cult, members are subjected\nto multiple forms of indoctrination. Some play on our natural inclination to\nmimic social behaviors or follow orders. Other methods may be more intense using techniques of coercive persuasion\ninvolving guilt, shame, and fear. And in many cases, members may\nwillingly submit out of desire to belong and to attain the promised rewards. The cult environment discourages\ncritical thinking, making it hard to voice doubts when everyone around you is modeling\nabsolute faith. The resulting internal conflict,\nknown as cognitive dissonance, keeps you trapped, as each compromise makes it more \npainful to admit you've been deceived. And though most cults don't\nlead members to their death, they can still be harmful. By denying basic freedoms of thought,\nspeech, and association, cults stunt their members'\npsychological and emotional growth, a particular problem for children, who are deprived of normal\ndevelopmental activities and milestones. Nevertheless, many cult members\neventually find a way out, whether through their own realizations, the help of family and friends, or when the cult falls apart\ndue to external pressure or scandals. Many cults may be hard to identify, and for some, their beliefs,\nno matter how strange, are protected under religious freedom. But when their practices \ninvolve harassment, threats, illegal activities, or abuse, the law can intervene. Believing in something should not come\nat the cost of your family and friends, and if someone tells you to sacrifice\nyour relationships or morality for the greater good, they're most likely exploiting you\nfor their own."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "All cults are religious.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "One characteristic of a cult is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All the members are young"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Everyone lives together"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The cult requires a personal transformation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They will all end in a mass suicide like Jonestown"}, {"label": "E", "text": "It allows members to be free thinkers"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Cult indoctrination techniques include the use of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Guilt"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Shame"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fear"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Only guilt and shame"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Cult leaders tend to be:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Generous"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Authoritarian"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Persuasive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Only authoritarian and persuasive"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Most cult members are lonely people who get recruited by friendly strangers.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Yet it wasn't always this way. 100 million years ago, during a period\nknown as the Mid-Cretaceous, a gargantuan river system flowed\nacross the region from modern day Egypt to Morocco. The whole world at that time\nwould look rather different to us. The continents had yet to assume\ntheir current positions. Extreme temperatures were common and fierce storms made life unpredictable. Dinosaurs flourished on land, pterosaurs roamed the skies, and giant marine reptiles and sharks\nswam in warm seas. Small mammals, our ancestors,\nlived quite literally in the shadow of these extraordinary creatures. In this world of huge predators, the River of Giants, which is what some call this region\nof what is now northern Africa, stood out as particularly dangerous. In most ecosystems, it's lonely at\nthe top of the food chain. There usually isn't enough prey\nto sustain many predators. Yet an incredible variety of aquatic\nprey species in the river-based ecosystem may have allowed a large and diverse\npopulation of apex predators to coexist. We know this thanks to a wealth of fossils\nwe found in an area called the Kem Kem Beds. Many of the predators we've discovered\nhad head and body shapes that made them uniquely adapted\nto hunt the different types and sizes of aquatic prey. This allowed many Kem Kem predators to\ntake full advantage of the one abundant food source\nin this environment: fish. This also allowed them \nto avoid direct competition with the predators going after\nland-loving animals. Prey species in the river system had to\ncontend with attacks from all sides, including from above. Flying reptiles dominated the skies. Alanqa Saharica had a wingspan of\nup to nine meters, and long slender jaws that helped it\nsnatch fish and small terrestrial animals. At least seven different types \nof crocodile-like predators patrolled the waterways, including the roughly \nten-meter-long Elosuchus. And multiple species of T-rex-sized\ncarnivorous dinosaurs called theropods, lived side by side. In the River of Giants,\nSpinosaurus was king. This 15-meter-long dinosaur was even\nlonger than T-rex, with short muscular hind legs, a flexible tail, and broad feet. It's two-meter-high sail warned\nother creatures of its fearsome size and may have also been \nused to attract mates. Spinosaurus' long slender jaws were spiked\nwith conical teeth, perfect for swiftly clamping down\non slippery aquatic prey. This apex predator, \nas well as its ecosystem, is unparalleled in the history\nof life on Earth. All that's left of these \nfearsome predators are fossils. About 93 million years ago, \nsea levels rose, submerging the Kem Kem region\nin a shallow sea. Tens of millions of years later, an asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, and associated changes in climate wiped out the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and\nmany other groups of animals and plants, including their unique ecoysystems.

The guards check your bag so you, I don't\nknow, shoot a painting; you go up some fancy escalators, you see naked statues. And then it happens. You see a super ugly Medieval baby. Why do medieval babies look like ugly middle\naged men? This baby looks like he wants to tell you\nto that 'a boat is just a money pit'. It might seem like medieval artists were just\nbad at drawing. But it turns out that babies in medieval art\nare actually ugly for a reason. While there were breakthroughs in anatomy\nand perspective that happened later in the Renaissance, ugly medieval babies were an\nintentional choice before that time. If somebody told you to paint like Pablo Picasso\nand you gave them Norman Rockwell, you would have screwed up. And it's the same way for artists working\nin churches in Italy. It's because most of these babies were depictions\nof Jesus and Mary. They were influenced by the idea of the homunculus,\nwhich is Latin for little man. These babies looked like Benjamin Button because\nphilosophers believed Jesus was born perfectly formed and unchanged. The adult Jesus was represented in the baby\nJesus. Until the Renaissance, when everything changed. Generally, we think of the Middle Ages lasting\nfrom around the 5th to 15th century, and it kind of overlapped the beginning of the Renaissance\nin the 14th century. The Renaissance probably began in Florence\nItaly, but it's important to note that it unfolded over centuries and countries in a\ntime when everything moved slowly. So, it wasn't instant beautiful babies everywhere. Still, the change in style did happen, and\nit happened for a couple of reasons. Places like Florence were getting richer and\nchurches weren't the only places that could afford paintings. People could get their own babies painted,\nand they wanted them to look like cute chubby babies, not homunculi. And because the Renaissance was all about\nclassics, they looked at Greek and Roman art, which was all about idealized forms that ditched\nthe medieval abstraction for beauty. Anyway, the point is that after the Renaissance\ncherubs didn't seem out of place, and neither did cuter pictures of baby Jesus as the Renaissance\nspread through Europe. And it's kinda stayed that way since. We want babies who look like they need their\ncheeks pinched, not their prostates checked. We want them chubby and cute, and we want\nbabies that fit our ideals.

He reasoned that as the wheels spun, the mercury would flow to the bottom\nof each reservoir, leaving one side of the wheel\nperpetually heavier than the other. The imbalance would keep\nthe wheel turning forever. Bhaskara's drawing was one of\nthe earliest designs for a perpetual motion machine, a device that can do work indefinitely\nwithout any external energy source. Imagine a windmill that produced\nthe breeze it needed to keep rotating. Or a lightbulb whose glow provided\nits own electricity. These devices have captured many\ninventors' imaginations because they could transform \nour relationship with energy. For example, if you could build \na perpetual motion machine that included humans as part of its\nperfectly efficient system, it could sustain life indefinitely. There's just one problem. They don't work. Ideas for perpetual motion machines all violate one or more \nfundamental laws of thermodynamics, the branch of physics that describes\nthe relationship between different forms of energy. The first law of thermodynamics says\nthat energy can't be created or destroyed. You can't get out more energy\nthan you put in. That rules out a useful\nperpetual motion machine right away because a machine could only ever\nproduce as much energy as it consumed. There wouldn't be any left over\nto power a car or charge a phone. But what if you just wanted the machine\nto keep itself moving? Inventors have proposed plenty of ideas. Several of these have been variations\non Bhaskara's over-balanced wheel with rolling balls \nor weights on swinging arms. None of them work. The moving parts that make one\nside of the wheel heavier also shift its center of mass downward\nbelow the axle. With a low center of mass, the wheel just swings back and forth\nlike a pendulum, then stops. What about a different approach? In the 17th century, Robert Boyle\ncame up with an idea for a self-watering pot. He theorized that capillary action, the attraction \nbetween liquids and surfaces that pulls water through thin tubes, might keep the water cycling\naround the bowl. But if the capillary action is strong\nenough to overcome gravity and draw the water up, it would also prevent it from falling\nback into the bowl. Then there are versions with magnets,\nlike this set of ramps. The ball is supposed to be pulled\nupwards by the magnet at the top, fall back down through the hole, and repeat the cycle. This one fails because like\nthe self-watering pot, the magnet would simply hold\nthe ball at the top. Even if it somehow did keep moving, the magnet's strength \nwould degrade over time and eventually stop working. For each of these machines to keep moving, they'd have to create some extra energy to nudge the system \npast its stopping point, breaking the first law of thermodynamics. There are ones that seem to keep going, but in reality, they invariably turn out\nto be drawing energy from some external source. Even if engineers could \nsomehow design a machine that didn't violate the first law\nof thermodynamics, it still wouldn't work in the real world\nbecause of the second law. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that energy tends to spread out\nthrough processes like friction. Any real machine would have moving parts or interactions with air \nor liquid molecules that would generate tiny amounts\nof friction and heat, even in a vacuum. That heat is energy escaping, and it would keep leeching out, reducing the energy available\nto move the system itself until the machine inevitably stopped. So far, these two laws of thermodynamics have stymied every idea \nfor perpetual motion and the dreams of perfectly efficient\nenergy generation they imply. Yet it's hard to conclusively say we'll\nnever discover a perpetual motion machine because there's still so much we don't\nunderstand about the universe. Perhaps we'll find \nnew exotic forms of matter that'll force us to revisit the laws\nof thermodynamics. Or maybe there's perpetual motion\non tiny quantum scales. What we can be reasonably sure about\nis that we'll never stop looking.

People line the streets to watch\nas she proclaims her innocence. It doesn't matter. She's already been judged\nand found guilty. The sentence? Live burial. The underground chamber contains\na portion of bread, water, milk, and oil. She will have a lamp, a bed,\nand a blanket, but she won't emerge alive. At the threshold, the priestess pauses, claims her innocence one last time, then enters the chamber never\nto be seen again by the Roman people. The priestess is one \nof Rome's six Vestal Virgins, each carefully selected as children\nfrom Rome's most aristocratic families. But now with her death,\nthere are only five, and a new priestess must be chosen. The six-year-old Licinia witnessed\nthe spectacle, never suspecting that a few days later,\nshe'd be chosen as the next Vestal Virgin. Her age, her patrician family lineage, and her apparent good health makes her the best candidate to serve the\ngoddess Vesta in the eyes of the Romans. Her parents are proud that their\ndaughter's been chosen. Licinia is afraid,\nbut she has no choice in the matter. She must serve the goddess\nfor at least the next 30 years. For the first ten years \nof Licinia's service, she's considered in training,\nlearning how to be a Vestal Virgin. Her most important duty is keeping vigil\nover the flame of Vesta, the virgin goddess of the hearth. Vesta doesn't have a statue\nlike other Roman gods and goddesses. Instead, she's represented by the flame\nwhich burns day and night in her temple located next to the Forum in the center\nof the city. Like all Vestal priestesses, Licinia\nspends part of each day on shift, watching and tending to the flame. The flame represents two things. The first is the continuation of Rome\nas a power in the world. The Romans believed that if the flame\ngoes out, the city's in danger. The flame also symbolizes the continuing\nvirginity of Vesta's priestesses. For the Romans, a Vestal's virginity\nsignaled not only her castitas, or modest spirit and body, but also her ritual purity. So Licinia knows she must never\nlet the flame go out. Her life, the lives of her fellow Vestals, and the safety of Rome itself \ndepends upon it. Licinia learns to collect water each day\nfrom a nearby fountain to cleanse the temple. She learns the Fasti, the calendar\nof sacred rituals and she watches while the senior\npriestesses conduct sacrifices. By the time Licinia \ncompletes her training, she's 16 years old. Licinia understands that \nthe way she must act is a reflection of the goddess she serves. When it's her turn to collect the water,\nshe keeps her eyes lowered to the ground. When she performs sacrifices,\nshe focuses intently on the task. Licinia directs her energy towards\nbeing the best priestess she can be. She's worried that someday the state\nwill claim her life for its own purposes to protect itself from danger. Licinia could be accused of incestum,\nmeaning unchastity, at any time and be sacrificed whether\nshe's innocent or guilty. Licinia fully understands now why her\npredecessor was buried alive. Ten years ago, \nthe flame of Vesta went out. The priestesses knew that they couldn't\nkeep it a secret. The future of Rome depended upon it. They went to the chief priest\nand he opened an investigation to discover why the flame had failed. Someone came forward and claimed\nthat one of the Vestals was no longer a virgin. That was the beginning of the end. The accused protested her innocence,\nbut it wasn't enough. She was tried and found guilty. That Vestal's death was meant\nto protect the city, but Licinia weeps for what has been lost\nand for what she knows now. Her own path was paved by the death\nof another, and her life could be taken just as easily for something as simple \nas a flame going out."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where is the temple of Vesta located?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Next to the River Tiber"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Next to the Roman Forum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "On the Via Appia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "On the Esquiline Hill"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the most important duty of a Vestal Virgin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Learning the fasti (the calendar of sacred rituals)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cleansing the temple each day with water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Keeping vigil over the eternal flame"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Maintaining castitas (modest spirit and body)"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many Vestal Virgins served at the same time?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the minimum length of service for a Vestal Virgin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "25 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "30 years"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What items is a Vestal Virgin buried with?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A portion of bread, water, milk, and oil"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A book and a light to read it by"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A blanket and a plate of figs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A portion of fish, milk, and grain"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
