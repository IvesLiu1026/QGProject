Empathy fuels connection.   Sympathy drives disconnection.   It's very interesting.   Theresa Wiseman is a nursing scholar   who studied very diverse professions \n where empathy is relevant   and came up with \n four qualities of empathy.   Perspective taking - ability to take \n the perspective of another person,   or recognise their perspective \n as their truth.   Staying out of judgment -   not easy when you enjoy it \n as much as most of us do.   (AUDIENCE CHUCKLES)   Recognising emotion in other people, \n then communicating that.   Empathy is feeling WITH people.   I always think of empathy \n as this kind of sacred space.   When someone's in a deep hole \n and they shout from the bottom...   ..And we look and we say, \"Hey!\" \n And climb down...   Sympathy is, \"Ooh!\" \n (LAUGHTER)   \"It's bad, uh-huh?\" \n (LAUGHTER)   \"Uh... No. You want a sandwich?\"   Empathy is a choice \n and it's a vulnerable choice.   In order to connect with you,   I have to connect with something \n in myself that knows that feeling.   Rarely, if ever, does an empathic \n response begin with, \"At least...\"   (LAUGHTER)   Yeah. And we do it all the time \n because, you know what?   Someone shared something with us \n that's incredibly painful   and we're trying \n to \"silver lining\" it.   I don't think that's a verb, \n but I'm using it as one.   We're trying to put a silver lining \n around it.   So, \"I had a miscarriage.\"   \"At least you know \n you can get pregnant.\"   \"I think my marriage \n is falling apart.\"   \"At least you have a marriage.\"   (LAUGHTER)   \"John's getting kicked out \n of school.\"   \"At least Sarah is an A-student.\"   One of the things we do sometimes   in the face of very difficult \n conversations   is we try to make things better.   If I share something with you that's \n very difficult, I'd rather you say,   \"I don't even know what to say. \n I'm just so glad you told me.\"   Because the truth is, rarely can \n a response make something better.   What makes something better \n is connection.

But this can – curiously – have some awkward consequences. There’s a type of under-confidence that arises specifically when we grow too attached to our own dignity and become anxious around any situation that might seem to threaten it. We hold back from challenges in which there is any risk of ending up looking ridiculous which comprises, of course, almost all the most interesting situations. In a foreign city, we might grow reluctant to ask anyone to guide us to the nice bars, because they might think us an ignorant, pitiable, lost tourist. We might long to kiss someone but never let on out of a fear that they could dismiss us as a predatory loser. Or at work, we don’t apply for a promotion, in case the senior management deems us delusionally arrogant. In a concerted bid never to look foolish, we don’t venture very far from our cocoon, and thereby – from time to time at least – miss out on the best opportunities of our lives. At the heart of our under-confidence is a skewed picture of how dignified it is normal for a person to be. We imagine that it might be possible, after a certain age, to place ourselves beyond mockery. We trust that it's an option to lead a good life without regularly making a complete idiot of ourselves. One of the most charming books ever written in early modern Europe is called 'In Praise of Folly' by the Dutch scholar and philosopher, Erasmus. In its pages, Erasmus advances a hugely liberating argument. In a warm tone, he reminds us that everyone, however important and learned they might be, is a fool. No one is spared, not even the author. However well-schooled he himself was, Erasmus remained – he insists – as much of a nitwit as anyone else: his judgement is faulty, his passions get the better of him, he is prey to superstition and irrational fear, he is shy whenever he has to meet new people, he drops things at elegant dinners. This is deeply cheering, for it means that our own repeated idiocies don't have to exclude us from the best company. Looking like a prick, making blunders and doing bizarre things in the night doesn’t render us unfit for society; it just makes us a bit more like the greatest scholar of the northern European Renaissance. There’s a similarly uplifting message to be pulled from the work of Pieter Brueghel. His central work, 'The Dutch Proverbs,' presents a comically disenchanted view of human nature. Everyone, he suggests, is pretty much deranged: here’s a man throwing his money into the river; there’s a soldier squatting on the fire and burning his trousers; someone is intently bashing his head against a brick wall; someone else is biting a pillar. Importantly, the painting is not an attack on just a few unusually awful people-- it’s a picture of parts of all of us. Brueghel’s and Erasmus’s work proposes that the way to greater confidence isn’t to reassure ourselves of our own dignity-- it’s to grow at peace with the inevitable nature of our ridiculousness. We are idiots now, we have been idiots in the past, and we will be idiots again in the future... and that's OK. There aren’t any other available options for human beings to be. Once we learn to see ourselves as already, and by nature, foolish, it really doesn’t matter so much if we do one more thing that might make us look a bit stupid. The person we try to kiss could indeed think us ridiculous. The individual we asked directions from in a foreign city might regard us with contempt. But if these people did so, it wouldn’t be news to us-- they would only be confirming what we had already gracefully accepted in our hearts long ago: that we, like them – and every other person on the earth – are a nitwit. The risk of trying and failing would have its sting substantially removed. A fear of humiliation would no longer stalk us in the shadows of our minds. We would grow free to give things a go by accepting that failure was the acceptable norm. And every so often, amidst the endless rebuffs we’d have factored in from the outset, it would work: we’d get a kiss, we’d make a friend, we’d get a raise. The road to greater confidence begins with a ritual of telling oneself solemnly every morning before heading out for the day, that one is a muttonhead, a cretin, a dumbbell and an imbecile. One or two more acts of folly should, thereafter, not matter very much at all."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the central argument of Erasmus' In Praise of Folly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Everyone is a fool"}, {"label": "B", "text": "We should prioritize having fun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "People who think they are smart, are actually fools"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Thinking you are incompetent makes you a fool"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

This concept of being thankful has been stressed\nin religion and philosophy for a long time. Back in 1820 Scottish philosopher Thomas Brown\ndefined gratitude as “that delightful emotion of love to him who has conferred a kindness\non us.” But scientifically, gratitude doesn’t qualify\nas a basic emotion like joy, sadness or anger. There’s no universal facial expression for\nit. As an emotion, gratitude is a little hard to define. Today the Oxford Dictionary defines gratitude\nas “the quality or condition of being thankful; the appreciation of an inclination to return\nkindness.” And we’ve only really started to study gratitude scientifically in the past\n30 years. In a 2015 study, participants were asked to\nimagine how they would feel if a complete stranger saved their life. I mean, how would\nyou feel? The participants had to rate how grateful they were to strangers who provided\nthem with gifts of food and clothing – all while they had their brain scanned in an fMRI\nmachine. Researchers found their ratings of gratitude\npositively correlated with activity in brain areas associated with fairness and value judgements.\nIt makes sense because gratitude is often thought of as a moral emotion. There are even benefits in just noting how\ngrateful you are. Another study asked people to write down three things that went well\nthat day and why for one week. At the end of the week people were slightly happier than\nat the beginning, and over time, their happiness scores kept improving. After one month they\nwere 5% happier and after six months they were 9% happier. Just from one week of writing\na journal. A similar study with participants with heart\ndisease found that keeping a gratitude journal increased their heart health and quality of\nsleep, perhaps because it reduces stress. “Counting your blessings” quite literally\nmakes people happier and healthier. And some people are even hardwired to be more\nthankful. In a recent study of 77 couples, those with a particular genetic variation\nthat affects the secretion of oxytocin expressed more gratitude towards their partners. Oxytocin\nis thought to play a big role in promoting close social bonds, so gratitude is part of\nthe glue that keeps these relationships together. So if you think it’s the thought that counts,\nthink again. Science shows there are some pretty amazing benefits to our mind, body\nand relationships when we say those two small words – thank you."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "1.

Here's how we stop it", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/food-waste-causes-climate-change-here-s-how-we-stop-it", "transcript": {"en": "this video is sponsored by Skillshare curries burgers sushi pizzas tortillas as a species food is central not only to our survival but also to our cultures we love food but as much as we love food we also love to throw it away the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that globally almost one third of food produced for consumption never gets eaten and in the u.s. that number is even higher forty percent of the u.s. is available food supply gets wasted every year as a report from the NRDC notes that's like buying five bags of groceries at the store and then just leaving two of them in the parking lot every time you shop so today we're going to look at food waste with three questions why is excessive food waste happening what are its environmental consequences and how can we fix it if all the food currently getting thrown in the landfill every year was instead diverted into meals for those in need we'd be able to feed as many as 1.8 billion people on top of that food waste has been estimated to be responsible for roughly 8 percent of global emissions if it was a country it would rank third under China in the United States for yearly greenhouse gas emissions it's large emissions footprint not only comes from all the energy needed to ship process and produce the food that ends up in the trash but also from the potent methane fumes that food emits as it decomposes in landfills so food waste is one of the many issues at the crossroads of climate action and social justice but food doesn't just sprout out of the ground and then magically end up in the trash there's a long chain of business and consumer interactions that at any point might turn perfectly edible food into waste simply put food transforms into trash in two general areas as it travels from farm to wait before the point-of-sale and after the point-of-sale if we look at this chart the majority of the food waste generated in the United States comes after the point-of-sale but let's look at the food loss before that on farms and in grocery stores in order to understand how this all starts before I transitioned to making YouTube videos full time I worked in a number of food-related positions where I saw firsthand how the drive for perfect abundant produce perpetuated an unnecessary trend of food waste as a farmhand at a number of different farms when I saw insect bites on arugula leaves or blemishes on peppers and tomatoes I knew they were destined to rot all that time effort and fuel wasted because the farm manager knew that better-looking produce will always sell over and perfect ones these cosmetically challenged products as they've come to be known can often end up left on the ground by harvesters or even make their way to landfills and into piles of food that decomposes and generate harmful emissions but the aesthetics of produce are just one part of the picture market prices for food can also affect weather crops make it through the harvest according to one recent study that analyzed on-farm food loss in California thirty three point seven percent of produce remains unharvested every year that's the equivalent of growing 300 acres of cantaloupe and leaving 100 acres of it to decay in the fields which according to an article from civil eats is exactly what happened to 6th generation farmer Canon Michel Michel couldn't justify paying workers to pick the cantaloupe because the cost of labour packing and shipping would have been more than the price he could get for the fruit and even if the food does make it off farms it still has to navigate the gauntlet of grocery store aisles one of the best ways to sell food is through the illusion of abundance people shop visually and to most that last Apple on the Shelf was left there because there was something wrong with it not because it just happened to be the last one in order to appear abundant grocery stores often over buy food to trick people into purchasing items as a result produce inevitably goes to waste as it sits out all day like glorified window dressing farmer Delaney's iock explains this dilemma and the documentary just eat it and there is an hour left in the market that one bunch of chard would sit there and no one would buy but if I had 30 bunches of chard all like bursting out I probably sell like 25 so what is that saving people are totally impulse shopping so at the grocery store and farmers markets vendors face an uphill battle against the old saying pile it high and watch it fly they need to produce an excess of food to sell their goods but that excess can at times lead to more waste after the point of sale the plague of food waste continues indeed household restaurant and food service waste accounts for 69 percent of the United States's annual food waste as a consumer and lover of food I've tried hard to minimize my waste but it can be easy to cook or by excess that ends up in the compost or trash for a family of four household food waste costs one thousand eight hundred dollars annually and with the average plate size expanding by 36 percent since 1960 and with refrigerators growing 30 percent in volume since 1972 it's tempting to buy more food just to fill up the space over buying and the inevitable cleaning out the refrigerator activity that comes with it can also be attributed to buy one get one promotions or purchasing in our appliances supermarkets and even our plates are all nudging us to buy or in addition to over buying in the United States there's also a severe lack of clarity when it comes to dealing with expiration dates and spoiled goods there are no federal laws regulating cell buy or expiration dates as a result labels can mean basically anything depending on where you buy your food in Missoula Montana for example milk sell by date is set at 12 days after pasteurization even though the standard is 21 to 24 days that's because in most cases these dates are set by the milk producer and not a regulatory service as one grocery vendor in Missoula laments the 12 day sell by date tells a consumer nothing it's just an arbitrary number somebody came up with with no scientific backing whatsoever this lack of clear information regarding when a product actually goes bad means that households throw out perfectly edible food well before it expires in short there are marketing labeling cultural and psychological forces all coming to play in order to make food waste a large problem in the United States ultimately there are many vectors by which food becomes waste whether in your own home or even before it makes it onto a grocery store shelf but there is hope there are very tangible solutions to these problems at all levels of the supply chain at the individual level solutions look like creating a plan to use all the food you buy or using sites like eat by date to truly understand whether your food has expired and then composting it instead of throwing it in the trash you can even get involved with groups like Food Not Bombs which has local chapters all over the world that recover food from local restaurants and stores and give it to those in need on the supply side solutions look like reducing food demand by eliminating buy-one-get-one promotions donating food that's not fit for sale or even using boxes and props to maintain the illusion of abundance without needed excess produce and on a policy level this means actions like standardizing expiration dates to accurately reflect the science behind foodborne illnesses food waste is a preventable problem an addressing food waste means tackling both climate change and hunger in the process we don't necessarily need fancy farming technologies to create more food for people who go hungry we just need to work together on every level to more equitably distribute the resources we already have and in doing so we not only mitigate climate change but also create stronger communities when I started making YouTube videos my motion graphics

{"page": 2, "lesson": 7, "title": "Why do we have leap years?", "category": "Teaching & Education", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/5sOlU5xb", "transcript": {"en": "People have been keeping track of time, pretty much since people were people. At first we just needed to have an idea of what season it was, and maybe what season was coming up next, and around when. But after the invention of agriculture, it started being important to keep track of each day of the year. Once you start trying to count the days of the year though, it doesn't take long to notice a problem: You just can't make a consistent calendar with the same number of days every year, because there aren't a whole number of days in the year. That is why today's date exists! We have to add an extra day to the calendar every now and then and we do it on February 29th. The main issue is that the Earth's orbit and its rotation don't have anything to do with each other. When our planet spins once around on its axis we call that a day and when it completes a full orbit of the sun, we call that a solar year. Now it'd be nice if Earth always got back to the same place in its orbit after a set number of complete rotations, which would be an exact number of days... but it doesn't. Earth orbits the sun once every 365.2425 rotations, so if your calendar has a whole number of days, like 365 or 366 than you're counting either too few days or too many. And if you're counting wrong, then things like the solstices, the longest and shortest days of the year, which always happen at the same point in the Earth's orbit, will move around the calendar. That makes it a little tricky to plan for events that you want to happen on the same day every year, say a solstice celebration. And if that wasn't complicated enough, a lot of ancient cultures, like the Babylonians, Chinese, and Romans, used calendars based on the moon. But, the behavior of the moon, again, has nothing to do with our rotation or our orbit. The moon goes through a little more than 12 cycles, each a little more than 29 days, in the time that it takes for the Earth to go around the sun. And that means they had a similar problem: 12 lunar months a year is too few, but 13 lunar months in a year is too many. So most people using a lunar calendar would have 12 months most years but then, they'd add an extra month every couple of years to keep things, like harvest, around roughly the same solar date. Then there were the Romans, always trying to keep things interesting. Instead of having a system in place, for how often there should be an extra month, they left it up to their highest religious authority: the Pontifex Maximus. Which kinda worked for a while, at least until Julius Caesar came along. The Romans thought adding those extra months was super bad luck, so they didn't want to do it while they were at war, and Julius was at war all the time. So, the calendar got way off from where it should have been. Eventually, Caesar decided that the Romans should just use a brand new calendar, that relied on a set system of, when and where to add extra days. And that's how we got the Julian Calendar, which Western Europe and Christian churches used for a really long time. Most Julian years had 365 days, but like we said earlier, the year is about a quarter of a day longer than that, so every 4th year got an extra 366th day. Seems like a good fix, but things are not that simple. The four year system ends up slightly over-estimating the length of the year by about 10 minutes Something the designers of the Julian calendar knew about but they decided it wasn't worth complicating the calendar over. It's 10 minutes a year, what could go wrong? Well, 10 minutes a year, over a lot of years, can really add up. By the late 1500s, around 1600 years after Caesar the calendar was about 13 days off from where it should have been. That's when Pope Gregory XIII, the Pontifex Maximus of the Catholic Church at the time, decided that the Julian calendar needed an overhaul. So he put together the Gregorian calendar, the one that we still use today, which is really just the Julian Calendar with a couple of changes. The Gregorian calendar's new rules were: Every 4 years add an extra day, except, don't add it when the year is divisible by 100 except, actually, do add it if the year is divisible by 400. So 1700, 1800, and 1900, weren't leap years because they were all divisible by 100, but not by 400. The year 2000 was a leap year since 2000 is divisible by 400. And, of course, 2016 is a leap year as well. If we were still using the Julian calendar, 2016 would still be a leap year But the calendar would now be behind by 16 days So this video would have been uploaded on February 13th, 2016 not February 29th. so it wouldn't have made any sense. But the universe is complicated and does not care about our calendars. So the Gregorian calendar is still a little bit too long we will add a day about every 7,700 years, but don't hold your breath for a new calendar. The Gregorian calendar was only introduced when the Julian one was 13 days off from the true date. And that won't happen to the Gregorian calendar for another 100,000 years or so.

Though this might seem like an ideal solution, there is a big problem associated with it. We're likely to be so busy taking the pictures we forget to look at the world whose beauty and interest prompted us to take a photograph in the first place. These problems seem to be very much of today a consequence of the tiny phones in our pockets. But, they would notice right in at beginning of the history of photography when the average camera was the size of a grandfather clock. The first person to notice them was the english art critic John Ruskin He was very impressed by cameras at first, but gradually he grew very suspicious of them believing they blinded us of our surroundings To try to correct this blindness Ruskin recommended that all of us take up drawing not with the view to becoming great artists but simply because through the act of trying to recreate on paper what we see in the world we studied it in a way we never do when we simply take a photograph Summing up what he attempted to do in four years of teaching and writing manuals on drawing Ruskin wrote: \"Let two persons go out for a walk;\" \"the one a good sketcher, the other having no taste of the kind.\" \"Let them go down a green lane.\" \"There will be a great difference in the scene as perceived by the two individuals.\" \"The one will see a lane and trees; he will perceive the trees to be green,\" \"though he will think nothing about it;\" \"he will see that the sun shines, and that it has a cheerful effect,\" \"and that's all.\" \"But what will the sketcher see?\" \"His eye is accustomed to search into the cause of beauty,\" \"and penetrate the minutest parts of loveliness.\" \"He looks up, and observes how the showery and subdivided sunshine\" \"comes sprinkled down among the gleaming leaves overhead,\" \"till the air is filled with an emerald light,\" \"he would see here and there a bough is seen emerging from the veil of leaves,\" \"he would see the jewel brightness of the emerald moss,\" \"and the variegated and fantastic lichens, \" \"white and blue, purple and red, \" \"all mellowed and mingled into a single garment of beauty.\" \"Then come the cavernous trunks, and the twisted roots\" \"that grasp with their snake-like coils at the steep bank, \" \"whose turfy slope is inlaid with flowers of a thousand dyes.\" \"Is not this worth seeing?\" \"Yet if you are not a sketcher you will pass along the green lane,\" \"and when you come home again, have nothing to say or to think about it,\" \"but that you went down such and such a lane.\""}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "John Ruskin, an art critic, initially was very impressed with the camera, what happened later on?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "he recommended that all of us take up drawing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "he became suspicious of them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "he felt cameras blinded us to our surroundings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "only a and c are correct"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above are correct"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "John Ruskin, an art critic, initially was very impressed with the camera, what happened later on?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "he recommended that all of us take up drawing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "he became suspicious of them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "he felt cameras blinded us to our surroundings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "only a and c are correct"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above are correct"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

{"page": 2, "lesson": 10, "title": "How much sleep do you actually need?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/fZIQPgYm", "transcript": {"en": "Tired? We all know the feeling; irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are you didn't sleep enough last night, or the past few nights. But what exactly is \"enough sleep?\" And more importantly, can you ever \"catch up\" on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it's necessary to function efficiently and productively. After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to four, five, and eight hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with eight hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses of cognitive issues; however, those with six or four hours of sleep showed a steady decline. In fact, after only two weeks, the six hour group showed a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The four hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of leveling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as sleep debt. So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep. On the timescale of months to years, it is unknown whether brain function can be fully repaired, or if it causes permanent damage. Paradoxically, with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness or how tired you feel does eventually level off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time. So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that seven to eight hours of sleep is the average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep less than seven hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, not to mention a 12% higher risk of death. On the flip side, studies have shown that while sleeping more than eight hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and a 30% increased risk of mortality! So too much sleep may also be a bad thing. But variation most certainly exists, and our genetics play a large role. In fact, individuals genuinely unaffected by only six hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out these short sleepers have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person. Ultimately, while it's important to know the ideal average of seven to eight hours exists, let your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits all.

{"page": 2, "lesson": 11, "title": "What would happen if you stopped brushing your teeth?", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/xC6cEbLC", "transcript": {"en": "From twigs to electrical toothbrushes humans have been cleaning our teeth since the ancient Egyptians in 5000 BCE. But, what if you just straight-up stopped brushing your teeth at all for the rest of your life? Within minutes of stopping, the food debris and moist environment from your saliva creates an ideal environment for bacteria to survive. Streptococci is one of the most common bacteria found in our mouth and it's normally not harmful, until it metabolizes sugar or protein from food debris. But after a full day, these bacteria would have already produced significant amounts of plaque from sugars. Plaque is the slimy layer of biofilm that you can feel on your teeth when you \"accidentally\" forget to brush sometimes. And this plaque actually helps the bacteria adhere to your teeth, which allows them to produce even more plaque creating a cycle of bacteria and plaque build up. After a week, all this build-up will cause some pretty serious bad breath. Not to mention that the plaque begins to harden and form tartar that lead to your teeth appearing yellow. At this point, you're also causing significant damage to tooth enamel as the bacteria break down sugar to produce lactic acid. Enamel is the hard mineralized outer layer of the tooth. And once it breaks down, you can't make any more. After a month, your decaying teeth will form cavities. These holes in your teeth get deeper and deeper if left untreated, leading to gingivitis, an early form of gum disease. This is because the immune system attacks your gums and teeth in response to the bacteria build up. Your cavities will fill up with pus, which is a protein-rich fluid filled with dead white blood cells and your gums will be extremely sensitive at this point, turning red when you touch it and bleeding with any significant pressure. After an entire year of neglect, you now have Periodontitis. The inner layer of the gum and bone are broken down by enzymes and pull away from the teeth to form pockets, which only further allow collected food debris and bacteria to gather. This causes the immune system to go into overdrive and destroys your gums and ligaments, resulting in advanced Periodontitis where your teeth become loose and begin to fall out. Any longer, and the issues can spread beyond your mouth and into your blood, causing inflammation throughout your organs and increasing the likelihood of erectile disfunction, head and neck cancer, chronic heart disease, and even dementia development. Combine your lack of brushing with a poor diet high in processed foods, and especially sugar, which is much more common now than early Homo sapiens would have experienced, and you have a much more accelerated breeding ground for bacteria, putting your whole body's health at risk.

{"page": 2, "lesson": 12, "title": "Why 350°F is the magic number for baking", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/seetvP8i", "transcript": {"en": "You ever notice this instruction that’s\nin nearly every baking recipe? Preheating your oven to 350 degrees is sort\nof a basic requirement for baking in America. Our ovens even do it automatically as we turn\nthem on, but have you ever stopped and asked yourself ... What’s so special about this number? I love to bake, but I’m certainly not a\npastry chef, so let’s meet someone with a bit more experience. This is Michael Laiskonis, the creative director\nat the Institute of Culinary Education. He's a pastry chef. So temperature is really important in baking\nnot only to develop color and flavor, but also to control the moisture in our products. As the temperature rises and moisture is lost\nat the surface, we get browning and also the creation of flavor compounds that didn't exist\nin that product previously. This happens because of a chemical process\nknown as the maillard reaction, which occurs when proteins and sugars are\ntransformed by heat and moisture. When sugar molecules are exposed to the heat\nin your oven they start to reduce – or break down – and interact with the proteins. That’s when you can see \nyour pastry turning golden brown. But it’s not just about that physical transformation. You can taste the effects of the maillard\nreaction too – that's what gives us the flavors\nof the golden crust on a piece of bread or a nice sear on a steak or that mellow richness\nof, say, caramelized onions. The trick behind that reaction is to find the perfect temperature that sets\nit into action without over or under-doing it. These recipes might make you think that Maillard reaction occurs at 350 degrees, but actually ... So these Maillard reactions tend to occur at\na fairly low temperature – around 230 to 240 degrees Fahrenheit. You want to manipulate the rate at which\nthis reaction occurs both at the surface and internally to get the results you want. If we bake too cool, the entire cookie, for example, will dry out before\nwe get that surface drying that will lead to browning. If we bake things in too hot an oven, the opposite\noccurs and we get burning. To get it just right we preheat the oven to 350 degrees\nso the Maillard reaction has time to occur throughout the entire cookie. For most home cooks and to also account for\nthe fact that everyone's oven is slightly different, I think 350 is a great benchmark to work from. It’s a safe standard for most\npeople, but the number can also be altered to yield slightly different\nresults. Some pastry chefs might bake at 325 if they want a lighter colored cookie,\nand some push it to 375 for a crispier outside. A lot of things that contemporary bakers tend\nto forget is not too long ago, in history, we didn't have as much control over our ovens\nor being a pastry chef meant being able to build a fire and maintain an oven temperature. Before the 1900’s, when ovens didn’t have\ntemperature regulators, recipe writers instructed bakers to “cook in a moderate” “hot”\nor “slow” oven depending on the food. After the second world war, the temperature gauge was developed and it became widely popular across households. Modern ovens typically ranged from 200 to\n550 degrees, so over time, recipe writers converted these temperature guidelines to actual numbers -- they settled on the 350 mark for “moderate”\nwhich was the sweet spot for baking. Using these more specific numbers is really\na result of better oven design and better oven control. And the more you understand about what goes on inside your oven, the better results you'll get. And who doesn't want a better cookie? Hey everyone, thanks for watching. If you're interested in more food content, head on over our sister channel Eater.

Today is the day after Thanksgiving here in America. Traditionally, the day when we buy all the things! Actually, more traditionally at my house, it's the day when we don't leave the house; because Black Friday.. terrifies me. For people who aren't American, the very ominous-sounding Black Friday is an accident of history. So, back in 1621, it was hard livin' here in America; and the first English settlers had a really bountiful crop. Apparently. This is somewhat mythological... And, it was on a Thursday; and they were thankful! That inspired a holiday; which is a nice kind of idea for a holiday, where you just talk about the things that you're thankful for. And eat a bunch of food! You also eat a bunch of food. Until the 1860's, different states celebrated this holiday on different days. Until Abraham Lincoln said: \"This.. is the day! We're gonna have a national day.\"; and, the South was like: \"We're not even part of you anymore. What are you talking about?!\" But then, when we got back together again, that was good; and it became the national holiday. The fourth Thursday in November. Now, because it's a national holiday on the Thursday, you also sort of get that Friday as a de facto day off. 'Cause you don't want to go back to work for one day and then have the weekend; that's just dumb! In the '60's [1960's], because so many people were going on vacation on this day, or, to a lesser extent, going shopping; this became such a terrible traffic mess that police and taxi drivers started calling it \"Black Friday\". As stores, and also just general consumerist cultures, started pushing the idea of Christmas shopping further and further away from Christmas; the big block in the road, where you can't push it back any further, is Thanksgiving. 'Cause that's its own holiday. You can't start Christmas before Thanksgiving. And so, Black Friday became the official tipping point into the consumerist bonanza that is the holiday shopping season! Despite the fact that it has kind of this ominous-sounding name, it has been billed as the biggest and most important and best holiday shopping day of the year; which is actually not true. We are.. a nation of procrastinators; and thus, the biggest shopping day of the year is Christmas Eve. It seems a little bit upsetting that the day after we all get done telling the world why we should be satisfied with our lives, we are.. barraged with an advertising blitz showing us all of the things that we lack! At the same time, it is very important to the American economy. I mean, you can't really get angry at people for wanting to give each other things... And yes, DFTBA.com has its own Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals; and you can go to DFTBA.com and check those out now. It's also our 4th Anniversary of being a company, which is very exciting! And, to celebrate that fourth anniversary, all shipping within the United States this weekend, starting tomorrow, I think, is just $4.00! No matter what you buy!! But, I do think it's important that we don't just scrub the idea of satisfaction and thankfulness out of our brains as soon as we're done for Thanksgiving. And so, on this Black Friday, I want to continue being thankful. I'm thankful to my wonderful and supportive parents; to my beautiful, and intelligent, and hilarious wife. I'm thankful to my new Wii U. If you want to go to youtube.com/hankgames, you can see us playing the new Super Mario Brothers there soon. I'm thankful to all of my great friends here in Missoula and across the world. I'm thankful to finally have a robust and stable forum that can handle the weight of Nerdfighteria. There's a link in the description. I'm thankful to Youtube and Google for funding SciShow and Crash Course, and for supporting VlogBrothers, and all of our endeavors through the years. I'm thankful to Reddit , and QI, and Mental Floss magazine, for making sure that I keep learning interesting things. I'm thankful to Jonas Salk for giving away the patent to his polio vaccine to the world, so that it could be less expensive to manufacture; and Tim Berners-Lee for doing basically the same thing with the internet. I'm thankful to the Nerdcrafteria Minecraft server and Tumblr, and the Ning; and all the other places on the internet where Nerdfighters do Nerdfighter things. And, I'm thankful to all the wonderful, thoughtful, intelligent people who watch and support the things that I do on the internet; even when it's sappy, silly videos like this one. And I'm thankful, of course, for my brother who's always driving me to do new and interesting and difficult things; and who's raising a wonderful family, and who says wise and intelligent things on Tumblr. And John, I'll see you on Tuesday. *Music plays*"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Black Friday follows what holiday in the United States?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Thanksgiving, the fourth Thursday of the month"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Easter, the last Thursday of the month"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The first Friday after Christmas"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The first Friday after Independence Day"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the biggest shopping day of the year in the United States?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Black Friday"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Christmas Eve"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The day after Christmas"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Memorial Day"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

And contrary to popular belief, cranberries don't grow under\nwater. So - how do they grow? We're in southern New Jersey - one of\nAmerica's top three cranberry states. This region is called the Pine Barrens,\nand natural habitat for cranberries. Many of the same families have farmed the berries since the mid-1800s - like the Leigh brothers - this seventh generation\ncranberry farm. Cranberries grow on low trailing vines and sunken beds called bogs. The plants are perennial, meaning they survive year after year. Here the oldest vines are over 65 years old. Cranberries love this sort of sandy soil, and they take a long time to grow - 16 months. You can see here that while the berries are ripening, the buds for next year's crop are already growing on the\nvine. So farmers have to carefully nurture two seasons worth of cranberries\nat one time. Water is one of the most precious resources for cranberry farmers.\nThis 2,000 acre farm uses only a hundred and thirty acres to grow cranberries. The\nrest is a series of reservoirs and watersheds. The primary sources that is\nthe waiting river, which runs naturally along the farm, and we'll borrow the water\nduring the growing season, and put it back in when we're finished with it.\nWe're simply holding the keys for the following generations after harvest. So\nwhat's all this water for, if the cranberries grow in dry land? Well, twice\na year the farmers flood the bogs. First in December for the duration of winter. This is when the plants go dormant, and their blanket of water insulates the\nvines from harsh winter frost. In the spring, the bogs are drained, and the cranberries' pink flowers bloom. Nowadays, many farms like Lee brothers hire commercial bees to pollinate the fields. And by mid-June, the fruit begins to grow,\nthe berries start out green, turn white around August, and finally, red in the\nfall. The funny thing about cranberries is, they don't really sweeten as they\nripen like strawberries or blueberries. They're a naturally tart fruit, whether\nthey're red or white, and the color is just skin deep. See, the\ninside is white and it's crisp like an apple, and inside there are four air\nchambers, which means that cranberries can - float - and that brings us to the\nsecond time the bogs are flooded: for the October Harvest. A harvester drives through to knock the berries off the vines. Then, farmers wade into the bog, to corral\nthe floating berries to an elevator that sucks them up into a truck. Nearly all the cranberry farmers in New\nJersey belonged to the Ocean Spray Cooperative, which grows over 60% of the\nworld's cranberries. These berries will be frozen and processed into craisins\nand cranberry juice. Remember, cranberries are tart, so a lot\nof cranberry products have added sugar, to make them sweet. But around\nThanksgiving, you can find whole cranberries (fresh or frozen) in the\nsupermarket, and you can easily turn these beauties into a killer cranberry\nsauce. You can even mold the sauce, and\nrefrigerate it for that fresh-from-a-can look, except this stuff is a whole lot\nbetter for you - and it tastes a whole lot better too..."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Annually, how much of America's total cranberry harvest is consumed around Thanksgiving?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "15%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "25%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Most cranberries harvested in the US are processed into juice, sauce, and dried, sweetened snacks.

That’s because coffee, bread, cheese, beer\n– even chocolate! – are home to millions of microbes. In fact, these foods only acquire the tastes,\nsmells, and textures we love because of tiny bacteria and fungi. The vast majority of microbes – about 99%\n– are actually quite harmless to humans. But the other 1% are nasty enough that our\nancestors – and the ancestors of various other mammals and birds – evolved a natural\nrepulsion to stuff that might harbor nasty germs. In general, we think rotten stuff looks and\nsmells disgusting, which, considering what's at stake, isn’t overly cautious. Fortunately, if friendly microbes get to our\nfood first, they can keep the bad guys at bay. Meat left out on the counter provides the\nperfect conditions for pathogens to flourish: it’s warm, moist, and protein-rich, just\nlike our bodies. But with some micromanagement – adding lots\nof salt, for instance – we can help harmless, salt-tolerant microbes like Lactobacillus\noutcompete their dangerous but salt-sensitive relatives. A few unrefrigerated months later, we get\nsalami, rather than Salmonelli! Our ancestors stumbled on this kind of controlled\nspoilage thousands of years ago – either by lucky accidents or out of serious desperation\n– and we humans have been intentionally spoiling food ever since. Not only to keep our food safe to eat, but\nalso because the microbes we culture can transform it, almost magically, into awesome deliciousness. Yeast, for example, gorge on the sugary starch\nin bread dough, then burp out carbon dioxide that helps give loaves their lift. In a more exotic transformation, bacteria\nand fungi take turns munching on piles of cacao, mellowing out bitter polyphenols and\nhelping create the complex and delicious taste of chocolate. And deep in cheese caves, mold spores populate\nsmall holes and cracks in soon-to-be blue cheese, while their relatives munch through\nthe rest of the blob, digesting big protein and fat molecules into a host of smaller aromatic\nand flavor compounds, that give the final product its smoothness and rich, funky flavor. But to some, stinky cheese is about as appetizing\nas licking someone’s toes. Which isn’t that far off, since the bacteria\nthat make some cheeses super-stinky are the same ones that cause foot odor. Yum? Even so, these flavors tend to grow on us:\nnot just literally but also figuratively. The more we’re exposed to particular microbial\nfunks – from our first taste of the flavor compounds in amniotic fluid forward – the\nmore we tend to like them. As a result, people around the world have\nsome very different ideas about how to microbe-ify foods – but every culinary culture involves\nfermentation in one way or another. And if we didn’t let food spoil just a little\nbit, we’d have no sauerkraut, soy sauce, pickles, or prosciutto. Not to mention kefir, kimchi, kombucha, koumiss,\nkatsuobushi - and plenty of other delicacies that don’t start with K. What’s more,\nspoiled food may well have changed far more than our tastes – historical evidence suggests\nthat, when our ancestors gave up their wandering ways and settled down to grow grain, it was\nlikely for love of either bread or beer. Whatever the case, one thing is clear: without\nthe help of friendly fermenting microbes, we humans would  be terribly uncultured."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Some foods acquire different ____________________ due to microbes.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "taste"}, {"label": "B", "text": "texture"}, {"label": "C", "text": "smells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "True or false?

who lives in a poor neighborhood he has a friend named kevin who lives in a wealthy neighborhood all of jamal's neighbors are african-american and all of kevin's neighbors are white because jamal school district is mostly funded by property taxes his school is not very well funded his classrooms are overcrowded his teachers are underpaid and he doesn't have access to high quality tutors or extracurricular activities kevin school district is also funded by property taxes so his school is very well funded his classrooms are never crowded his teachers are very well paid and he has access to high quality tutors and lots of extracurricular activities kevin and jamal live only a few streets away from each other so how come they're growing up in such different worlds with such different opportunities for success the answer has to do with america's history of systemic racism to understand it better let's look at what life was like for kevin and jamal's grandparents decades after the civil war many government agencies started to draw maps dividing cities into sections that were either desirable or undesirable for investment this practice was called redlining and it usually blocked off entire black neighborhoods from access to private and public investment banks and insurance companies use these maps for decades to deny black people loans and other services based purely on race historically speaking owning a home and getting a college education is the easiest way for an american family to build wealth but when jamal's grandparents wanted to buy a house the banks refused because they lived in a neighborhood that was redlined so jamal's grandparents were not able to buy a home and because colleges could prevent them from attending through legal segregation their options for higher education were really scarce kevin's grandparents on the other hand got a low interest loan to buy their first house and get accepted into a handful of top universities which traditionally only accepted white students this opened up a wealth of opportunities that they were able to pass on to their kids and grandkids even as late as the 1980s an investigation into the atlanta real estate market showed that banks were more willing to lend to low-income white families than to middle or upper-income african-american families as a result today for every hundred dollars of wealth held by a white family black families have five dollars and four cents a 2017 study confirms that redlining is still affecting home values in major cities like chicago today this explains how kevin and jamal inherited vastly different circumstances unfortunately the story doesn't end there a big part of systemic racism is implicit bias these are prejudices in society that people are not aware that they have let's go back to kevin and jamal against all odds jamal manages to be the only student from his high school to get accepted into a great university the same one that kevin and his high school friends are attending but after kevin and jamal both graduate jamal notices that his resume isn't drawn as much interest as kevin's even though they graduated from the same program with the exact same gpa unfortunately for jamal studies show that resumes with white sounding names get twice as many callbacks as identical resumes with black sounding names implicit bias is one of the reasons why the black unemployment rate is twice the rate of white unemployment even among college graduates today you can see evidence of systemic racism in every area of life the disparities in family wealth incarceration rates political representation and education are all examples of systemic racism unfortunately the biggest challenge with systemic racism is that there's no single person or entity responsible for it which makes it very hard to solve so what can you do the first thing you can do is work towards becoming more aware of your own implicit biases what are some prejudices that you might hold that you're not aware of second let's acknowledge that the consequences of slavery and jim crow loss are still affecting access to opportunity today as a result we should support systemic changes that create more equal opportunities for everyone increasing public school funding and making it independent from property taxes would be a great start so that poor and wealthy districts can receive equal access to resources systemic problems require systemic solutions luckily we're all part of the system which means that we all have a role to play in making it better

{"page": 2, "lesson": 18, "title": "The taxonomy of candy", "category": "Anthropology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/XrdZdIJI", "transcript": {"en": "[Emily}: Hey! So taxonomy is a totally complicated, really interesting field of science responsible for the naming and classification of things and we started to kind of get into this topic with our previous episode on \"What is a Species\", where we look into species definitions and concepts but I thought it would be really fun to do a hands-on experiment and there's nothing better than getting a couple of expert taxonomists in on the game.   [Olivier]: I'm Olivier Rieppel. I'm the Roe family curator of evolutionary biology here at the Field Museum in Chicago. [Janet]: I'm Janet Voight. I'm a MacArthur Associate Curator here at the Field Museum in the Intergrative Research Center. [Larry]: My name is Larry Heaney. I am the Negaunee Curator of Mammals at the Field Museum at the Field Museum of Natural History. [Margaret]: My name's Margaret Thayer. I'm a curator emeritus at the Field Museum I study insects, particularly beetles. [Emily]: And we wanted to get them to look at something in-depth that maybe they hadn't considered classifying before. Skittles! Peanut M&Ms! Peanut butter M&Ms! Nerds! Plain M&Ms! Starbursts! Reese's Pieces! Jellybeans! Chocolate-covered peanuts! Chewy Jolly Rancher thingies! Starburst jellybeans! And we had some black licorice, but I lost it. That's right--we're doing the taxonomy of candy. [Brain Scoop intro music] [Olivier]: If you want to classify things--and that can be anything, I mean, organisms you classify according to illusionary relationships With candy, or office furniture, or whatever you classify according to similarities. [Janet]: the art of taxonomy requires that you actually separate that new thing that you think you've found as much as you can from every other species that looks like it. [Larry]: I like chocolate-covered candy.\n[Emily]: OK. [Larry]: And so we could group it together that way. [Emily]: So, essentially, all of these on this side, and we can move the Nerds over here. [Larry]: And that one too.\n[Emily]: Yup.\n[Larry]: Yup.\n[Larry]: Can I have one of those? [Emily]: Yes, feel free. [Margaret]: I think investigating their contents would be an important thing to look at. It's not quite as hard as it looks. [Emily]: Oh wow! [Margaret]: That has some kind of jelly material in it. (chewing) I don't usually use this test for specimens, but...(both laugh) [Emily]: Do you eat the beetles that you study?\n[Margaret]: No, not normally. [Margaret]: We occasionally sniff them, but that's all. \n[Emily]: Oh. [Olivier]: Here are the roundish things, the big ones, and then the smaller roundish things would be more closely related to that batch here than to any of the others. [Janet]: Right now I'm approaching these jars as collections made of what's likely the same species. The collections were made at one spot, at one time. [Emily]: You went to the river, put the jar in the water, and it was filled with Reese's Pieces. [Janet]: Yeah.\n[Emily]: OK.\n[Janet]: In La-La Land, I mean, but...\n(both laugh) [Larry]: So we could group things together, put the chocolate ones together that way OR we could take the red ones and put those together.\n[Emily]: Allll of the red ones. [Margaret]: That would be like taking a whole bunch of different red birds and putting them all together because they're red but one of them is a cardinal and one is some kind of duck, and you know...*muttering*..they're not related at all, so.... [Emily]: They're not even close.\n[Margaret]: Yeah. [Emily]: So would you put those with the other bean shapes, here?\n[Olivier]: So these are the bean shapes, here... [Olivier]: And then you have the bean shaped, you have the rounded, that go closer, that go over with the bean shaped... And you have the small rounded, that go closer with those... [Janet]: So just flipping through these, I'm seeing these Reese's Pieces: different colors, but the shape is amazingly uniform. These, with a strange letter \"M\", have some damage--I see their guts are actually chocolate. So my hypothesis is that each of these things, despite being a different color, actually has guts of chocolate. [Emily]: So you think that the red Skittles and the red Jolly Ranchers, and the red black-covered licorice, as gross as it is, can all be one thing. [Larry] (eating candy): Absolutely.\nThat's the thing about candy. You can put it together, you can group them any way you want.\n[Emily]: Mm-hmm\n[Larry]: Doesn't matter. [Olivier]: The way they are mixed up, you can't classify them in colors, because there is all colors in one. [Emily]: Right.\n[Olivier]: So, not many characters to go with. [Emily]: I have insider knowledge: I have done extensive work on the taxonomy of Jelly Bellies. [Margaret]: (laughing)\n[Emily]: And I can tell you that there are 36 different flavors in here. [Emily]: What would you make of something like that? [Margaret]: Well it could be that, uh, if we worked out the taxonomy of these things, we might decide that the Jelly Bellies were a genus unto themselves. And those 36, 37 flavors were different species of Jelly Bellies. [Emily]: Oh wow.\n[Margaret]: Similarly, those other jelly bean things, that would be another way to interpret those as well. [Emily]: They're like the same family.\n[Margaret]: *clears throat* Yeah. [Emily]: They're in the jelly bean family.\n[Margaret]: The jelly bean family, right. [Emily]: I want to organize candy in a way where I can reach my hand in and shove them all in my face You can't do that with the red candy because then you've got like the peanut M&M and then the cinnamon Jelly Belly. [Larry]: Cinnamon and peanut butter actually would go together well.... [Larry]: You can try that.\n[Emily]: Um, I'm okay. [Emily]: I'm alright.\n*both start laughing* [Janet]: So you slap out your pen and your paper and your computer and you say, \"Why are they different?\" So you add all those up and then you go back and look in the literature For previously published descriptions of things that are kind of like this. \n[Emily]: Uh-huh [Janet]: In the same genus, let's say---or maybe in related genera, because sometimes a genus isn't as good as you think it is... [Emily]: nyeah...\n[Janet]: But then you read those, and you look at them, and if you're kind of confused, then you try and get a hold of specimens, so that way...\n[Emily]: And then it keeps kinda going. [Olivier]: The goal of classification, in terms of organisms, the goal of classification is to bring out their evolutionary relationships. [Larry]: What makes organisms so different is that our classifications of those is based on their relationships, on their ancestors. We don't put red bats and red foxes together. We COULD put red candy together! It makes perfect sense, why not? But we don't do it with red bats and red foxes because they DON'T share a common ancestor except way way way way WAY back. [Olivier]: Yeah, there's very many ways to classify things, and it's an interesting problem. Why there should be so many ways to classify things, and what these different classification things say about the world. [Emily]: And what does it say about us as people--\n[Olivier]: as people, exactly. [Emily]: For choosing the ways, ways that we choose [Olivier]: Which means to say, is it us bringing order to the world? Or does the world come to us in an ordered way? [Olivier]: And probably is the first way around.\n[Emily]: Oh wow. Now you're going into the philosophical rabbit hole."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Taxonomy is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a numeric system to calculate taxes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the classification of things"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the naming of things"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both b and c"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "You are looking at different organisms that have been collected from your local ecosystem.

The latin name for pumpkins is Cucurbita pepo,\nwhich just means gourd melon, a truly uninspired bit of naming.\nLike all fruit, pumpkins are both a trick and a treat – The seeds are hidden inside a delicious,\nbrightly covered package So animals to will eat them, \nand then spread them around. Pumpkin seeds (or pepitas) have evolved tough\nshells that can survive the exciting journey through an animal's\ndigestive tract. In Russia, some believe that eating pumpkin\nseeds can help get rid of parasitic worms. It's\nnot clear if that really works in humans but there is a real published study in which\npumpkin seeds helped de-worm ostriches. Pumpkins come from the Americas - they were\nactually one of the first plants domesticated here 8-10 thousand years ago.\nWhen the pilgrims arrived in 1620 they ate a lot of pumpkins.\nThey even wrote a poem about. That rhyme scheme was not great, but maybe that’s because the pilgrims were also making\na lot of beer with their pumpkins. Pumpkin beer was already a thing way back in the 17th century Sorry hipsters! People once thought they could get rid of freckles\nby putting mashed-up pumpkin on there faces. And in all fairness that probably did distract\nfrom the freckles. Explorers soon brought pumpkins back to europe.\nIt was only 1697 when a Frenchman incorporated a pumpkin into\nthe popular folktale we know as Cinderella. That was actually a very specific variety\nof pumpkin - a red pumpkin – and there are lots of other colors. Yellow, white, even blue. And all pumpkins start out green – their\nskin is full of green chlorophyll that photosynthesizes just like in a leaf. As the pumpkin ripens, the chlorophyll breaks down, and other pigments like orange carotene\nbecome visible. You know how they gas green\ntomatoes to turn them red? It's called ethylene  - and its given off\nby a lot of ripening fruits. So if you have an unripe green pumpkin and\nyou want to change its color, put it in a bag with some old apples\nand wait a few days.

Well that expression is a bit misguided. During the day, some kinds of bats can see almost as well as humans. But when the sun goes down, nocturnal bats rely on their ears more than their eyes to navigate. This special navigation process is called echolocation. In echolocation, bats use a combination of the voice, ears, and echoes to create a perceptual map that allows them to \"see\" in the dark. You might be wondering where an echo comes from. An echo is the reflection of sound reaching a listener. Sound is a vibration that ripples away from its source in waves. The rate at which this vibration occurs is called its frequency. Sound waves at high frequencies are high-pitched. Humans can hear sounds at frequencies between 20 and 20,000 waves per second and don't perceive pitches outside that range. Bats, on the other hand, can hear and produce sound at frequencies over 100,000 waves per second- way beyond the range of human hearing. Here, we've slowed down a bat's chirp, so you can hear it! This chrip is the first step in the process of bat echolocation, the primary sound that the bat will use to detect information about its surroundings. The bat listens as the chirp leaves its body and bounces off its surroundings. When the sound returns to the bat, the cartilage of the outer ear funnels the sound waves into the ear canal. The waves then reach the eardrum, which vibrates in response. These vibrations are transferred further into the ear to the basilar membrane, which runs the length of the cochlea. If you uncoil the cochlea and the basilar membrane, they would look like this. Each area of the membrane moves in response to a particular frequency. Then, the cochlea converts these vibrations into nerve impulses for the brain to interpret. The bad echolocate so fast that it can track down a dinner of insects moving around in complete darkness. Special muscles in its throat make it possible for the bat to chirp 160 to 190 times per second! Because it receives so much information at once, it has to differentiate relevant information from signal clutter. To do this, the bat emits chirps of varying frequency patterns, each of which echoes off objects differently depending on the object's size, shape and distance from the bat. Then, by analyzing resulting echo intensities, it creates a mental map of its surrounding physical space. When looking for prey, the bat first sends out low-frequency chirps over a wide range. Llarger objects will reflect more intense echoes, but it's often the smaller objects, like insects that the bat is targeting. Once a bat receives low-intensity echoes from small potential prey, it will remit a high frequency chirp directed toward it. When both high-and low-frequency echoes return to the bat, it is able to ignore the now-irrelevant, low-frequency ways that reflect from the trees or rocks that surround its meal. To gauge how far away a given object is, the bat analyzes the time delay between when it hears its chirp and perceives the resulting echo. Directional information comes from comparing information the bat receives in each ear. For example, let's imagine that a bat's chirp echoes back from an insect to this side of the bat. Since this ear is closer to the insect, it will receive the sound before the other ear. By interpreting the difference between when it receives the echo in each ear, the bat can guide itself towards the insect. Bat are only one type of animal that use echolocation. killer whales, dolphins, porpoises and some birds echolocate as well. Scientists who developed sonar and radar got their ideas from the study of echolocation in bats and whales. The U.S. Navy and other research groups are especially interested in echolocation because it could lead to even more technology!

Well, yes - and if you don't think so, here's\nwhy these terrifying creatures are worth avoiding at all costs! As if you need another reason to hate mosquitoes\n- when they bite humans they can leave larvae of the parasitic Filarial Worm. These worms live and grow in our bodies, sometimes\ntaking years to mature into full adults, leaving only inconspicuous rashes and sores. Years later, they work together to block the\nvessels of your lymphatic system, creating a build-up of fluid and leading to diseases\nlike elephantiasis. This is one of the leading causes of disability\nin the world. Another worm worth hating is the pinworm. Pinworm eggs are often eaten because of contaminated\nor dirty hands. The eggs hatch and mature in your gut, at\nwhich point the adult female exits the anus to lay a new batch of eggs on the surrounding\nskin. Your butthole becomes a nest! This causes intense itching, often leading\nto re-contaminated hands or fingernails, which can end up in your mouth again, restarting\nthe cycle. Feel like scratching your bum? Do yourself a favour and wash those hands\nand fingernails! On the other side of the body, live the lovely\npubic lice - sometimes called 'crabs'. Though it's not uncommon to find these buggers\nin your eyebrows, beard or even eyelashes. The itching is from an allergic reaction to\ntheir saliva, and it'll take treatment with medication or shaving it all off to get rid\nof them. Of course, abstinence or no sex works well\nas a preventative measure, along with not sharing your undies with other people. Some parasites are meant for marine animals,\nbut end up in humans out of the goodness of our...gut? The Anisakis Nematode infects humans after\neating raw or undercooked fish - like sushi - which contains the larvae. The worms penetrate our gut wall and cause\nabdominal pain, nausea and even vomiting. But, nobody really wins this one, as the nematode\ncan't mature in a human gut and eventually dies. The Tongue Biter is another marine parasite. This tongue eating louse finds a suitable\nfish and chews off it's tongue, only to cling on to the stub in it's place. Here they stay feeding on the fishes blood,\nall the while mating and dispersing their progeny into the ocean. And finally, the wonderful cordyceps which\nare fungi known for creating zombie ants. The fungus takes over the ants body and mind,\nmaking it leave the colony and begin climbing upward to a more ideal temperature and humidity. The ant then bites onto a stem or leaf and\ngets locked into position until it dies. At which point, the fungus bursts through\nthe ants head and spreads outward. Could such a parasite ever affect humans? For everyone's sake, we hope not! Our friends at James Cook University helped\nus put this horrifying list of parasites together, with special help from parasitologist Dr Kate\nHutson. JCU is one of the world's leading institutions\nfocusing on the tropics with an opportunity to study in a diverse physical environment\nunparalleled by any university in the world. I actually studied there for a semester abroad! If you want to learn more, be sure to head\nover to their website jcu.edu.au - link in the description!
