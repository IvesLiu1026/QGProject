How can that be? The answer lies in the bail system— which isn’t doing \nwhat it was intended to do. The term \"bail\" refers to the release\nof people awaiting trial on condition that they return \nto court to face charges. Countries around the world \nuse many variations of bail, and some don’t use it at all. The U.S. bail system relies primarily \non what’s called cash bail, which was supposed to work like this: When a person was accused of a crime, the judge would set \na reasonable price for bail. The accused would pay this fee \nin order to be released from jail until the court reached \na verdict on the case. Once the case ended, \nwhether found guilty or innocent, they’d get the bail money back \nif they made all their court appearances. The rationale behind this system \nis that under U.S. law, people are presumed innocent\nuntil proven guilty— so someone accused of a crime \nshould not be imprisoned unless they’ve been convicted of a crime. But today, the bail system in the U.S. doesn’t honor the presumption\nof innocence. Instead, it subverts peoples’ rights\nand causes serious harm, particularly to people \nin low-income communities and communities of color. A key reason why is the cost of bail. In order for cash bail \nto work as intended, the price has to be affordable\nfor the accused. The cost of bail wasn’t meant to reflect\nthe likelihood of someone’s guilt— when bail is set, the court \nhas not reviewed evidence. Under exceptional circumstances, \nsuch as charges of very serious crimes, judges could deny bail \nand jail the accused before their trial. Judges were supposed to exercise \nthis power very rarely, and could come under scrutiny\nfor using it too often. Setting unaffordably high bail \nbecame a second path to denying people pretrial release. Judges' personal discretion \nand prejudices played a huge role in who they chose to detain this way. Bail amounts climbed higher and higher, \nand more and more defendants couldn’t pay— so they stayed in jail. By the late 19th century, these circumstances led to the rise \nof commercial bail bond companies. They pay a defendant’s bail, in exchange\nfor a hefty fee the company keeps. Today, the median bail is $10,000— a prohibitively high price \nfor almost half of Americans, and as many as nine out of ten defendants. If the defendant can’t pay, they may apply for a loan \nfrom a commercial bail bond company. It’s completely up to the company \nto decide whose bail they’ll pay. They choose defendants they think \nwill pay them back, turning a profit of about\n$2 billion each year. In fact, in the past 20 years, pretrial detention has been the main\ndriver of jail growth in America. Every year, hundreds of thousands \nof people who can’t afford bail or secure a loan\nstay in jail until their case is resolved. This injustice disproportionately affects\nAmericans who are Black and Latino, for whom judges often set higher bail than for white people accused\nof the same offenses. Unaffordable bail puts even innocent\ndefendants in an impossible position. Some end up pleading guilty to crimes \nthey did not commit. For minor offenses, the prosecution \nmay offer a deal that credits time already spent in jail toward \nthe accused’s sentence if they plead guilty. Often, the time they’ve already spent in\njail is the total length of the sentence, and they can go home immediately—\nbut they leave with a criminal record. Defending their innocence, meanwhile, can mean staying in jail indefinitely\nawaiting trial— and doesn’t guarantee \nan innocent verdict. Bail may not even be necessary\nin the first place. Washington, D.C. largely abolished\ncash bail in the 1990s. In 2017, the city released 94% \nof defendants without holding bail money, and 88% of them returned\nto all their court dates. The nonprofit organization, \nThe Bail Project, provides free bail assistance to thousands\nof low-income people every year, removing the financial incentive\nthat bail is designed to create. The result? People come back \nto 90% of their court dates without having any money on the line, and those who miss their court dates \ntended to because of circumstances like child care,\nwork conflicts, or medical crises. Studies have also found that holding\npeople in jail before trial, often because they cannot\nafford cash bail, actually increases the likelihood\nof rearrests and reoffending. The damage of incarcerating people \nbefore their trials extends to entire communities\nand can harm families for generations. People who are incarcerated \ncan lose their livelihoods, homes, and access to essential services— all before they’ve been convicted \nof a crime. It’s also incredibly expensive: American taxpayers spend \nnearly $14 billion every year incarcerating people \nwho are legally presumed innocent. This undermines the promise \nof equal justice under the law, regardless of race or wealth. The issues surrounding cash bail \nare symptomatic of societal problems, like structural racism and over-reliance\non incarceration, that need to be addressed. In the meantime, \nreformers like The Bail Project are working to help people trapped \nby cash bail and to create a more just and humane\npretrial system for the future."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When is cash bail set during the legal process?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "As an alternative to serving a sentence, after you’ve been convicted of a crime."}, {"label": "B", "text": "As a way to get out if you are in prison."}, {"label": "C", "text": "After you’ve a been accused of a crime, but before you’ve had your day in court."}, {"label": "D", "text": "After you decide not to plead guilty."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the purpose of cash bail as originally intended?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To punish you financially for committing a crime."}, {"label": "B", "text": "To create an incentive to return to court until a judge decides the case."}, {"label": "C", "text": "To pay the court back for the legal fees associated with prosecuting a case."}, {"label": "D", "text": "To raise funds for police departments."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When do you get cash bail back?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "At the end of your case, whether you are found guilty or innocent, so long as you came back for your court dates."}, {"label": "B", "text": "At the end of your case, but only if you are found innocent."}, {"label": "C", "text": "You don’t get it back.

{"page": 80, "lesson": 2, "title": "4 signs of emotional abuse - Viann Nguyen-Feng", "category": "Emotional Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/4-signs-of-emotional-abuse-viann-nguyen-feng", "transcript": {"en": "Emotional abuse can be\nincredibly damaging, increasing a person’s chances \nof developing depression and anxiety sometimes for decades after the fact. Broadly speaking, emotional abuse involves\none person controlling another by undermining their sense of self-worth\nand personal agency. But emotionally abusive behaviors can be\nsubtle and difficult to spot, both from within \nand outside the abusive relationship. That’s partly because emotional abuse\noften exploits or creates power imbalances \nbetween individuals, especially in relationships\nwhere safety, care, and trust are supposed to be guaranteed, like the relationship between\na caregiver and a child, healthcare provider and patient,\nteacher and student, or intimate partners. It’s especially insidious because \nit often makes people doubt their perceptions \nof their own mistreatment. So let’s walk through some of the most\ncommon signs of emotional abuse, to make these behaviors and patterns\neasier to spot in real life. First, the content of someone’s words: criticism that’s out of proportion\nto a situation, excessively harsh or personal,\nor makes sweeping generalizations or baseless negative predictions \nfor the future is a warning sign of emotional abuse. Statements like, “You always make\nsuch stupid decisions,” “You never do anything right,” \nand “Nobody else will ever love you,” aren’t constructive; \nthey’re never warranted, and someone’s use of them is a red flag. Second, tone and non-verbal cues: yelling, ignoring and showing contempt\nthrough body language are all ways to degrade someone. Dismissive behaviors like eye rolling,\nglaring, or refusal to make eye contact, along with refusing to speak to someone\nor acknowledge their presence— sometimes called “the silent treatment”— can all feature in patterns \nof emotional abuse. These behaviors can painfully transform the meaning of spoken statements \nthat might otherwise seem benign. Third, how someone reacts\nto being told they’ve said or done something hurtful \ncan give important insight: do they apologize sincerely \nand act differently in the future, or do they dismiss and minimize\nthe pain they’ve caused? It’s common for abusers to try \nto undermine their target’s perceptions of events— this is sometimes referred \nto as “gaslighting.” Following up demeaning,\nhumiliating, or threatening remarks with comments that dismiss\nthe impact of those remarks, like “I’m just trying to help you \nimprove yourself— you should be grateful,” or “It’s really you that’s selfish \nand manipulative— you’re hurting me,” are examples of this behavior. Lastly, when someone directs any \nof these behaviors at you, take note of whether this is part \nof a pattern of behavior from them. A one-time incident of name-calling\nor a demeaning insult might not be emotional abuse, while repetition over time can have \na much more serious impact. Both frequency, how often these behaviors\noccur in a given period of time, and duration, or how long they last, \nwhether days or years, can contribute \nto the severity of the abuse. It’s also important to remember \nthat abusers rarely engage in abusive behaviors 100% of the time— moments of kindness or calm \ndon’t invalidate moments of abuse, but are actually part of the cycle\nof emotional manipulation. So what can you do if you think you\nor someone you care about is experiencing emotional abuse? Maintaining interpersonal ties with people\nother than the abuser is crucial, as abusers often try to isolate \ntheir targets from others close to them. If you think you might be experiencing\nemotional abuse, consider sharing your experiences\nwith a trusted friend or relative to get outside support. Or you can seek local or national\nconfidential advocacy centers that can provide helpful resources. And if you think someone you know\nis being emotionally abused, check in with them. Let them know you’re thinking of them and that you're ready to listen\nwhenever they'd like to share. While emotional abusers may convince\npeople that they deserve to be mistreated, nobody does: everyone deserves\nkindness and respect."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is the most fitting example of criticism that is a sweeping generalization?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Comments such as, “You never do anything right.”"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Statements such as, “Nobody else will ever love you.”"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Refusal to make eye contact while refusing to acknowledge one’s presence."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Remarks that undermine one’s perceptions of events."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following is the most fitting example of a baseless negative prediction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Comments such as, “You never do anything right.”"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Statements such as, “Nobody else will ever love you.”"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Refusal to make eye contact while refusing to acknowledge one’s presence."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Remarks that undermine one’s perceptions of events."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is the most fitting example of dismissive behavior in the form of “silent treatment”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Comments such as, “You never do anything right.”"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Statements such as, “Nobody else will ever love you.”"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Refusal to make eye contact while refusing to acknowledge one’s presence."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Remarks that undermine one’s perceptions of events."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is the most fitting example of “gaslighting”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Comments such as, “You never do anything right.”"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Statements such as, “Nobody else will ever love you.”"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Refusal to make eye contact while refusing to acknowledge one’s presence."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Remarks that undermine one’s perceptions of events."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Emotional abuse includes which of the following components?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Content of someone’s words"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tone and nonverbal cues"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both of A and B"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

I'd run home from the bus stop\nafter school and practice for hours. Every Saturday, my mom and I\nwould wake up at four in the morning to catch a train to New York\nso I could study at Juliard. Here's a throwback to eight-year-old me\nperforming the violin. Some questionable fashion choices\nfrom young Maya here, not going to lie. But anyway, when I was a teenager,\nmy musical idol, Itzhak Perlman, invited me to be his private student. And my big dream of becoming\na concert violinist felt within reach. But then one morning when I was 15, I was practicing this tricky\ntechnical passage. I struggled to get it right, and I overextended my finger\non a single note. I heard a popping sound. I’d permanently damaged\nthe tendons in my hand, and my dream was over. I share this story because unexpected change\nhappens to all of us. An accident or an illness, a relationship that suddenly ends. Today, I'm not a violinist,\nbut I'm a cognitive scientist. And I'm interested in how we respond\nto exactly this kind of change. I spent the past two decades\nstudying the science of human behavior. And today I host a podcast called\n\"A Slight Change of Plans\" -- (Audience cheers) glad you guys like it -- where I interview people\nfrom all over the world about their life-altering experiences. I started this podcast because change\nis scary for a lot of us, am I right? For one, it is filled with uncertainty, and we hate uncertainty. Research shows that we're more stressed when we're told we have a 50 percent\nchance of getting an electric shock than when we're told we have\na 100 percent chance. It's wild, right? I mean, we'd rather be sure\nthat a bad thing is going to happen than to have to deal with any uncertainty. Change is also scary\nbecause it involves loss of some kind. By definition, we're departing\nfrom an old way of being and entering a new one. And when we experience a change that we wouldn't\nhave chosen for ourselves, it's easy to feel\nthat our lives are contracting, that were more limited than before. But when we take this perspective, we fail to account for an important fact. That when an unexpected\nchange happens to us, it can also inspire\nlasting change within us. We become different people\non the other side of change. What we're capable of, what we value\nand how we define ourselves, these things can all shift. And if we can learn to pay close attention\nto these internal shifts, we may just find that rather\nthan limiting us, change can actually expand us. Alright, today I'm going to share with you\nthree questions you can ask yourself the next time life throws you\nthat dreaded curveball. In the moment, I know it's so easy\nto focus on what you've lost. And so I'm really hoping that you can use\nthese questions as tools to discover all that you might gain. Alright, let’s start\nwith question number one. This is inspired by a conversation\nI had on my podcast with a woman named Christine Ha, and it's about our capabilities. Christine was 24 when a rare autoimmune\ndisease left her permanently blind. At the time, she was learning to cook\nthe Vietnamese dishes that she had loved in childhood. But now cooking even simple\nmeals was tough. She told me that her\nfrustration peaked one day when she was making\na peanut butter and jelly sandwich. She struggled to align\nthe two slices of bread and sticky jelly dripped all over\nher hands and onto the counter. She threw the sandwich into the trash, and she felt really defeated\nby the limited future that she imagined for herself. Since Christine lived alone though, she had no choice but to keep at it. She remembers her delight\nwhen she successfully cut an orange for the first time and when she scrambled an egg\nwithout burning it. As she spent more hours in the kitchen, she realized that cooking was far more\nmulti-sensory than she had thought. While she couldn't see\nif the garlic had browned, she could rely on the smell\nand the sizzling sounds in the pan. But Christine also realized\nsomething bigger. Something new was emerging within her. At the start of her vision loss\nshe had cooked just to get by. I mean, it was really\njust a practical thing. But now she was thrilled\nby the challenge of it all. She tackled harder and harder\nrecipes over the years and eventually became\nthe first-ever blind contestant on the TV show \"Master Chef.\" And guess what? She won the entire damn thing. (Laughs) Christine's a rock star. She's an amazing, amazing person. This brings us to the first question\nthat you can ask yourself the next time you face\nsomething unexpected. \"How might this change\nchange what you're capable of?\" When we predict how we'll respond\nto any given change, we tend to imagine what our present-day\nselves will be like in that new situation. Research by the psychologist Dan Gilbert\nshows that we greatly underestimate how much we'll change in the future, even though we fully acknowledge\nwe've changed considerably in the past. Our psychology continually\ntricks us into believing that who we are, right now,\nin this very moment, is the person that's here to stay. But the person meeting the challenges\nafter an unexpected change will be different. You will be different. Today, Christine is a world-renowned chef. She goes by the nickname The Blind Cook, and she owns three restaurants in Texas. And importantly, she's really curious about what else\nshe can achieve without vision. These days, you can find her\nsnowboarding and rock climbing on the weekends. Christine shared with me something that she could never have imagined\nthinking before all this. That if given the choice today, she would choose not to have\nher vision restored. Though she did tell me\nshe'd like it back for a moment because she really wants to know\nwhat Justin Bieber looks like. (Laughter) Alright, let's move on\nto the second question. This one is about our values, and it's inspired by a conversation I had with a science journalist\nnamed Florence Williams. One evening about five years ago, Florence and her husband were hosting\na dinner party for their friends. As she was preparing the salad,\nher husband handed her his phone so that she could read\nan email from a relative. But he'd mistakenly\npulled up the wrong email. What Florence saw instead was a lengthy note from her husband, confessing his love to another woman. I know. Florence’s 25-year marriage\ncame to an end, and she told me that she was taken aback by the physical and emotional\nintensity of her heartbreak. She said it felt like she'd been plugged\ninto a faulty electrical socket. Since Florence is a problem\nsolver by nature, she instinctively saw her heartbreak\nas a problem to solve and develop a year-long,\nsystematic plan to try and fix it. Florence tried a bunch of things. She took solo trips into the wilderness, she tried a range\nof experimental therapies, She even went to the Museum\nof Broken Relationships, which I promise is the thing. You name it, she tried it. But by the end of the year, none of these remedies\nhad healed her broken heart. And so Florence had no choice but to entertain\na new philosophy altogether. Maybe a broken heart\nwas not a problem to solve. And maybe closure wasn't the answer. Research by the psychologist\nDacher Keltner shows that when we reduce our need\nfor what's called cognitive closure, the desire to arrive at clear\nand definitive answers, our capacity to feel joy\nand beauty expands. Florence told me that when she freed\nherself from this goal-oriented mindset, a mindset, by the way,\nthat she had valued for so much of her life\nup until this point, she began to find unexpected\ndelight in the unknown. This leads us to the second question\nyou can ask yourself the next time you face\nsomething unexpected. How might this change\nchange what you value? The unexpected implosion\nof Florence's marriage has permanently shifted the way\nthat she sees her life. From a puzzle in need of solutions to a more serendipitous path of discovery. Now, when Florence goes hiking, she's just as likely to sit still,\nfeeling the breeze, as she is to try and make the summit. She no longer makes five-year plans. And she's comfortable not knowing\nall the answers around her heartbreak. By the way, I was texting\nwith Florence the other day, and she's currently in a very\nhappy relationship. If her ex-husband is listening to this,\nI just want him to know she's doing great, buddy. (Laughter) Alright, now on to question number three. This one is about how we define ourselves. It's about our self-identities. And it comes from my personal story\nof change with the violin. When my injury took\nthe violin away from me, I found myself grieving\nnot just the loss of the instrument, but also the loss of myself. For so long, the violin had defined me, that without it, I wasn't sure\nwho I was or who I could be. I felt stuck. I'd later learned that this phenomenon\nis known as identity paralysis. It happens to a lot of us\nwhen we face the unexpected. Who we think we are and what we're about\nis suddenly called into question. But I since realized\nthat there was something different, something more stable that I could\nhave anchored my identity to. And this brings us to that third\nand final question. How might this change\nchange how you define yourself? When I re-examine\nmy relationship with the violin, I discovered that what I really missed\nwasn't the instrument itself, but the fact that music\nhad given me a vehicle for connecting emotionally with others. I remember as a little kid\nplaying for people and feeling kind of awestruck that we might all feel\nsomething new together. What this means for me today is that I no longer anchor\nmy identity to specific pursuits like being a violinist\nor a cognitive scientist or a podcaster. Instead, I anchor my identity\nto what lights me up about those pursuits, what really energizes me. And for me, it's a love\nof human connection and understanding. I now define myself not by what I do, but why I do it. Look, unexpected change comes for us all,\nwhether we like it or not. And when it does, it can really suck. But I'm hoping that if we can stay open\nto how we might internally change, how we might expand, it can help us weather the storm. Life recently threw me\na new slight change of plans. I've always wanted to be a mom, but becoming one has been difficult and my husband and I\nhave had to navigate pregnancy losses and other heartbreaks over the years. And now I'm not sure what will happen. But I'm using these three questions\nto help me during this tough time. I'm asking myself\nhow this unexpected challenge might change what I'm capable of, what I value, and how I define myself. I'm still figuring things out. But what I can tell you right now is that I'm imagining a future me who is expanding her definition\nof what it means to parent. Who's perhaps finding what she craved\nfrom motherhood in other places. At a minimum, this exploration has allowed me to loosen my grip on the identity\nof Mom just a bit. And I found it freeing. I'm beginning to see change\nwith more possibility. And I'm hoping you can, too. Thank you so much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

You've been studying and playing for days,\nbut you still don't feel ready for either. So, what can you do? Well, you can drink another cup of coffee and spend the next few hours \ncramming and practicing, but believe it or not, you might be better off closing the books,\nputting away the music, and going to sleep. Sleep occupies nearly \na third of our lives, but many of us give surprisingly\nlittle attention and care to it. This neglect is often the result \nof a major misunderstanding. Sleep isn't lost time, or just a way to rest \nwhen all our important work is done. Instead, it's a critical function, during which your body balances\nand regulates its vital systems, affecting respiration and regulating everything from circulation\nto growth and immune response. That's great, but you can worry about \nall those things after this test, right? Well, not so fast. It turns out that sleep \nis also crucial for your brain, with a fifth of your body's \ncirculatory blood being channeled to it as you drift off. And what goes on \nin your brain while you sleep is an intensely active period \nof restructuring that's crucial for how our memory works. At first glance, our ability to remember things \ndoesn't seem very impressive at all. 19th century psychologist \nHerman Ebbinghaus demonstrated that we normally forget\n40% of new material within the first twenty minutes, a phenomenon known\nas the forgetting curve. But this loss can be prevented \nthrough memory consolidation, the process by which\ninformation is moved from our fleeting short-term memory\nto our more durable long-term memory. This consolidation occurs with the help\nof a major part of the brain, known as the hippocampus. Its role in long-term memory formation was demonstrated in the 1950s\nby Brenda Milner in her research with \na patient known as H.M. After having his hippocampus removed, H.M.'s ability to form new short-term memories\nwas damaged, but he was able to learn physical tasks\nthrough repetition. Due to the removal of his hippocampus, H.M.'s ability to form long-term memories\nwas also damaged. What this case revealed,\namong other things, was that the hippocampus \nwas specifically involved in the consolidation of\nlong-term declarative memory, such as the facts and concepts\nyou need to remember for that test, rather than procedural memory, such as the finger movements\nyou need to master for that recital. Milner's findings, along with work \nby Eric Kandel in the 90's, have given us our current model \nof how this consolidation process works. Sensory data is initially transcribed and temporarily recorded in the neurons\nas short-term memory. From there, it travels to the hippocampus, which strengthens and enhances \nthe neurons in that cortical area. Thanks to the phenomenon\nof neuroplasticity, new synaptic buds are formed,\nallowing new connections between neurons, and strengthening the neural network where the information will be returned\nas long-term memory. So why do we remember\nsome things and not others? Well, there are a few ways to influence the extent and effectiveness \nof memory retention. For example, memories that are formed\nin times of heightened feeling, or even stress, will be better recorded due to \nthe hippocampus' link with emotion. But one of the major factors contributing\nto memory consolidation is, you guessed it, a good night's sleep. Sleep is composed of four stages, the deepest of which are known\nas slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement. EEG machines monitoring\npeople during these stages have shown electrical impulses moving between the brainstem,\nhippocampus, thalamus, and cortex, which serve as relay stations \nof memory formation. And the different stages of sleep\nhave been shown to help consolidate different types of memories. During the non-REM slow-wave sleep, declarative memory is encoded \ninto a temporary store in the anterior part of the hippocampus. Through a continuing dialogue \nbetween the cortex and hippocampus, it is then repeatedly reactivated, driving its gradual redistribution\nto long-term storage in the cortex. REM sleep, on the other hand, with\nits similarity to waking brain activity, is associated with the consolidation\nof procedural memory. So based on the studies, going to sleep three hours after \nmemorizing your formulas and one hour after practicing your scales\nwould be the most ideal.

The crowd holds its breath, and, at the crucial moment,\nshe misses the shot. That competitor just experienced \nthe phenomenon known as \"choking,\" where despite months, \neven years, of practice, a person fails right when it matters most. Choking is common in sports, where performance often occurs \nunder intense pressure and depends on key moments. And yet, performance anxiety \nalso haunts public speakers, contestants in spelling bees, and even world-famous musicians. Most people intuitively\nblame it on their nerves, but why does being nervous \nundermine expert performance? There are two sets of theories, which both say that primarily, choking \nunder pressure boils down to focus. First, there are the distraction theories. These suggest that performance suffers \nwhen the mind is preoccupied with worries, doubts, or fears, instead of focusing its attention\non performing the task at hand. When relevant and irrelevant thoughts \ncompete for the same attention, something has to give. The brain can only process \nso much information at once. Tasks that challenge working memory, the mental “scratch pad” we use to temporarily store phone numbers \nand grocery lists, are especially vulnerable to pressure. In a 2004 study, \na group of university students were asked to perform math problems, some easy, others more complex \nand memory-intensive. Half the students completed both problem\ntypes with nothing at stake, while the others completed them \nwhen calm and under pressure. While everyone did well \non the easy problems, those who were stressed \nperformed worse on the more difficult, \nmemory-intensive tasks. Explicit monitoring theories make up \nthe second group of explanations for choking under pressure. They’re concerned with how pressure can cause people to overanalyze\nthe task at hand. Here, the logic goes that \nonce a skill becomes automatic, thinking about its precise mechanics \ninterferes with your ability to do it. Tasks we do unconsciously seem to be\nmost vulnerable to this kind of choking. A study on competitive golfers compared \ntheir performance when instructed to simply focus on\nputting as accurately as possible, versus when they were primed \nto be acutely aware of the mechanics of their putting stroke. Golfers usually perform \nthis action subconsciously, so those who suddenly tuned in \nto the precise details of their own moves also became worse \nat making accurate shots. Choking may not be inevitable \nfor everyone though. Research suggests that some are\nmore susceptible than others, especially those who are self-conscious, anxious, and afraid of being judged \nnegatively by others. So, how can we avoid choking \nwhen it really counts? First, it helps to practice \nunder stressful conditions. In a study on expert dart players, researchers found that those \nwho hadn’t practiced under stress performed worse when anxious, compared to those who had \nbecome accustomed to pressure. Secondly, many performers extol the \nvirtues of a pre-performance routine, whether it’s taking a few deep breaths, repeating a cue word, or doing a rhythmic sequence of movements. Studies on golfing, bowling, \nand water polo find that short rituals can lead \nto more consistent and accurate performance under pressure. And thirdly, researchers have shown that having an external focus \non the ultimate goal works better than an internal focus, where someone is tuned into the mechanics \nof what they’re doing. A study of experienced golfers revealed \nthat those who hit chip shots while focused on the flight of the ball performed significantly better than those\nwho focused on the motion of their arms. So, perhaps we can modify \nthat age-old saying: practice, under pressure, with focus, and with that glorious end goal in sight, makes perfect."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "“Choking” generally occurs among athletes, musicians, and other performers at what level?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "International-level"}, {"label": "B", "text": "National-level"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Amateur-level"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All levels"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "According to distraction theories, which situations would most likely cause you to choke?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Worrying about missing a shot"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Worrying about what the audience thinks of your talk"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Worrying about whether you’ll have enough time to finish a test"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Explicit monitoring theories predict that you would be more likely to choke if you ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Paid close attention to what your shoulder, elbow, wrist, and fingers were doing while throwing a dart"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Focused your attention on the target as you threw the dart"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both paid close attention to your limbs and focused your attention on the target"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neither paid close attention to your limbs or focused your attention on the target"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following characteristics describe an individual who would be most susceptible to choking?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Extroverted"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Introverted"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Anxious"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Depressed"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is an effective way to prevent choking?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spend more time practicing the skill"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pay closer attention to the mechanics of a skill"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Practice in high-pressure situations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Jeyasingam", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/a-brief-history-of-antidepressants-neil-r-jeyasingam", "transcript": {"en": "In the 1950s, \nthe discovery of two new drugs sparked what would become a multibillion \ndollar market for antidepressants. Neither drug was intended \nto treat depression at all— in fact, at the time, many doctors \nand scientists believed psychotherapy was the only approach \nto treating depression. The decades-long journey of discovery\nthat followed revolutionized our understanding \nof depression— and raised questions \nwe hadn’t considered before. One of those first two antidepressant\ndrugs was ipronaizid, which was intended to treat tuberculosis. In a 1952 trial, \nit not only treated tuberculosis, it also improved the moods of patients who had previously been diagnosed \nwith depression. In 1956, a Swiss clinician observed \na similar effect when running a trial for imipramine, \na drug for allergic reactions. Both drugs affected a class \nof neurotransmitters called monoamines. The discovery of these \nantidepressant drugs gave rise \nto the chemical imbalance theory, the idea that depression is caused\nby having insufficient monoamines in the brain’s synapses. Ipronaizid, imipramine, \nand other drugs like them were thought to restore that balance by increasing the availability \nof monoamines in the brain. These drugs targeted several\ndifferent monoamines, each of which acted on a wide range\nof receptors in the brain. This often meant a lot of side effects, including headaches, grogginess, \nand cognitive impairments including difficulty with memory, \nthinking, and judgment. Hoping to make the drugs more targeted \nand reduce side effects, scientists began studying existing \nantidepressants to figure out which specific monoamines \nwere most associated with improvements in depression. In the 1970s, several different\nresearchers converged on an answer: the most effective antidepressants \nall seemed to act on one monoamine called serotonin. This discovery led to the production\nof fluoxetine, or Prozac, in 1988. It was the first of a new class of drugs called Selective Serotonin \nReuptake Inhibitors, or SSRI’s, which block the reabsorption of serotonin,\nleaving more available in the brain. Prozac worked well \nand had fewer side effects than older, less targeted antidepressants. The makers of Prozac also worked \nto market the drug by raising awareness \nof the dangers of depression to both the public \nand the medical community. More people came to see depression \nas a disease caused by mechanisms beyond \nan individual’s control, which reduced the culture of blame \nand stigmatization surrounding depression, and more people sought help. In the 1990s, the number of people being\ntreated for depression skyrocketed. Psychotherapy and other treatments\nfell by the wayside, and most people were treated \nsolely with antidepressant drugs. Since then, we’ve developed a more nuanced\nview of how to treat depression— and of what causes it. Not everyone with depression responds \nto SSRIs like Prozac— some respond better to drugs \nthat act on other neurotransmitters, or don't respond to medication at all. For many, a combination \nof psychotherapy and antidepressant drugs is more effective than either alone. We’re also not sure why antidepressants\nwork the way they do: they change monoamine levels within\na few hours of taking the medication, but patients usually don’t feel\nthe benefit until weeks later. And after they stop \ntaking antidepressants, some patients never experience \ndepression again, while others relapse. We now recognize that we don’t\nknow what causes depression, or why anti-depressants work. The chemical imbalance theory \nis at best an incomplete explanation. It can’t be a coincidence that almost all\nthe antidepressants happen to act on serotonin, but that doesn’t mean serotonin deficiency\nis the cause of depression. If that sounds odd, \nconsider a more straightforward example: steroid creams can treat rashes\ncaused by poison ivy— the fact that they work doesn’t mean\nsteroid deficiency was the cause of the rash. We still have a ways to go in terms \nof understanding this disease. Fortunately, in the meantime, \nwe have effective tools to treat it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The first antidepressants were initially designed to treat", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tuberculosis and Allergic Reactions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "High Blood Pressure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Heart Failure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Depression"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Some of the common side effects of early antidepressants were", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Memory impairment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Judgement impairment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Headaches and grogginess"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Difficulty with thinking"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The Chemical Imbalance Theory first referred to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Serotonin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Noradrenaline"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Monoamines"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dopamine"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Choline"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Most antidepressants act on serotonin.

And during my years as a therapist there, there was one question I always reviewed\nbefore meeting with a new client. It asked this: What is your purpose in life? Defined as a central motivating life aim,\nsomething you're trying to accomplish. Now, to be fair,\nthis is a difficult question. Identifying a single purpose\nin life feels really hard. It also feels consequential. Many people spend years searching for\nand developing their purposes, and some never find it. But typically we see responses like this: to be an engaged parent, to make meaningful change in my community, to build a career I'm proud of, to live for a long time,\njust keeping it simple. But then there was the answer\nof one young woman who I worked with. Before meeting with her, as I always did, I flipped to see\nhow she described her purpose. And she wrote this: \"To avoid being noticed by other people.\" This young woman, a bright, witty,\ncompassionate high schooler, decided that her purpose in life was to make sure that other people\ndid not know that she existed. This is the power of social anxiety. At its core, social anxiety\nis about the fear of being rejected. When we feel socially anxious, we become hyper-focused\non how we are appearing to others. We scan the room looking for signs\nof threat and disapproval, signs we might have slipped up\nand are at risk for rejection. And then we seek comfort\nin signs of approval, smiles, head nods, laughs and so on. And while social anxiety\ncan be exhausting, it exists for a reason. Social anxiety tries\nto protect us from rejection, and it does that by tuning us in\nto the nuances and norms and dynamics of a social group so we can match our behavior\nto fit in with them and ultimately avoid being rejected. This is a good thing\nbecause humans are social. We exist in social groups, we rely on each other\nwhether or not we like that, but also more simply\nbecause rejection is painful. Take a moment to think\nabout your own rejection experiences, however cringeworthy, we all have them. Maybe you were ghosted after a first date. Been there. Maybe you were rejected\nfrom your dream job. Maybe you were ousted from a friend group. Rejection's unpleasant. And social anxiety\ntries to protect us from it. But social anxiety becomes problematic when it begins to interfere\nwith the life you want to live. And this happens\nwhen your fear of rejection becomes intertwined\nwith your view of yourself. When you believe you will be rejected because you think you have\nsome inherent flaw, deficiency or failing of character. You were ghosted after that first date, and you believe it's because you were not\nlovable or attractive enough. You were turned down from your dream job, and you believe it's because you were not\nintelligent or competent enough. You were ousted from that friend group, and you believe it’s because you were not\ninteresting or funny enough. Our fear of rejection is really\na fear of being less than. Less than we want to be, less than we think we should be or less than we believe\nsociety wants us to be. Now, over time, this belief system can develop\ninto social anxiety disorder. When a person has social anxiety disorder, they become overly concerned\nabout other people scrutinizing them, evaluating them harshly\nand ultimately rejecting them. So much so that they begin to construct\ntheir lives around avoiding rejection. Because if you can avoid being\nnoticed by other people, then those people have fewer data\npoints on which to reject you. Now, social anxiety disorder is one of the most common\nmental illnesses in the world. In the United States alone, more than 12 percent of Americans\nat some point in their lives will have diagnosable\nsocial anxiety disorder. That's roughly 40 million people. Now worldwide, the estimates\nare lower, they're four percent, which in and of itself is interesting. But based on current population estimates, four percent of the world\nis roughly 300 million people that will potentially have\nsocial anxiety disorder at some point in their lifetime. And despite how prevalent it is,\nit's widely misunderstood, widely misdiagnosed and often missed entirely. This is because several myths\nabout social anxiety pervade our culture. The first myth is that people\nwith social anxiety are happier alone. The stereotype of someone\nwith social anxiety as a recluse who'd rather be hiding away\nalone in their bedroom than out interacting with the world. And this is simply not true. In research conducted in my lab, we find that people\nwith social anxiety disorder desire strong, healthy,\nintimate relationships to the same degree\nas those without mental illness. And they do socialize, they’re not robotic aliens. And when they socialize, they often enjoy doing so. In fact, when we ask people\nwith social anxiety how happy they are, they report feeling happier\nwhen they are with other people than when they're alone. This is because not all social\ninteractions are stressful. Maybe someone feels\nsocially anxious with friends but not their romantic partner. Or they feel anxious with strangers\nand acquaintances but not people like their\nneighbors or coworkers. So even though some\ninteractions are stressful, people with social anxiety are not devoid\nof the basic desire for human connection. They just have trouble obtaining it\nin certain situations with certain people. OK, so maybe then people\nwith social anxiety do socialize, and when they do, they enjoy it. But it's with a small,\ntight-knit group of people. And really, social anxiety is about\navoiding the spotlight. And this is the second myth. Social anxiety is not necessarily\nabout a fear of public performance. While this is true of some people, other people with social anxiety\nfind performing in front of others less anxiety-provoking than smaller, more intimate conversations, like when they have to carry\na conversation one on one. Many people with social anxiety\nexcel in careers that are intertwined with social\nevaluation and social performance. Modeling, acting, sports. In May of 2021, Naomi Osaka declined to participate\nin press conferences of the French Open. She courageously and preemptively shared that they exacerbated her social anxiety. Shortly thereafter, she received a wave\nof public backlash and scrutiny. She goes on to play her first match, of course, wins, and then she withdraws\nfrom the French Open. Many people were perplexed about how someone\ncould have social anxiety and also be the number one ranked\ntennis player in the world, lead a fashion campaign\nwith Nike -- good choice -- and don the cover of Sports\nIllustrated in a swimsuit. In an interview the year prior\ndiscussing her social anxiety, Osaka explained: \"On the court is completely different. I love playing at Arthur Ashe\nbecause it’s the biggest stadium, and you feel the rumble of the crowd. You kind of feel like a gladiator\nbecause it’s super-big and there are so many people\nwatching your match. But off the court, if I was ever thrown into a situation where I had to speak\nin front of 100 people, I feel like I would start shaking.\" There is no one-size-fits-all\nprofile of social anxiety. Just like people who are depressed\nhave different collections of symptoms at different times for different reasons, social anxiety looks different\nin different people. And last and maybe\nthe most problematic myth. That social anxiety\nis fleeting and harmless. Social anxiety is not just\nsomething you grow out of. It doesn't magically disappear when you graduate\nmiddle school or high school. Without intervention, many people struggle\nwith social anxiety for years, for decades. And social anxiety can influence\nevery aspect of a person's life. It can influence the hobbies they choose, maybe opting for solo activities\nlike reading, writing, rather than things like team sports. It can influence\nthe careers people pursue. Maybe opting for careers\nwith more individual, like computer time, versus things like sales\nor customer service. And social anxiety could influence\npeople's everyday lives. Ricky Williams, star NFL running back, Heisman-winning running back, dazzled millions of people\non the football field every week. And yet he shared that he struggled\nwith social anxiety, and because of it, he had difficulty interacting\nwith teammates, running everyday errands where he'd have to interact with people and even interacting\nwith his own daughter. The real tragedy of social anxiety is that it robs individuals\nof their greatest resource: other people. Other people help us overcome adversity, like recovering from illness\nor after you bomb a job interview. Other people help us celebrate milestones like showing up to the birth of our child\nor a wedding or a graduation. And other people help us overcome loss, like grieving the death of a loved one. Our fear of rejection gets in the way\nof obtaining and appreciating the benefits of being accepted,\nthe benefits of other people. And in our modern world, it is harder than ever\nto manage social anxiety. We are more connected today\nthan any time in human history, and yet we are lonelier, more depressed and more socially anxious than ever. We have endless tools to socialize, and yet we're seeing\na decaying social connection. In a rapid amount of time, our social structures have been\nupended and rewritten. Technology and social media\nhave created new standards for social relationships and interactions: \"Do I post it, do I share it,\ndo I like it, do I love it?\" We create these bizarre\nextensions of ourselves through curated profiles and now avatars. We try to make sense of unlimited feedback from a massive and often\ninvisible audience. And the costs of social\nblunders are higher. Things you do and things you say\ncan live online forever and subject you to unforgiving scrutiny, reputation loss and even job loss. It is a tough time to have social anxiety. But the world will become more,\nnot less, connected, and the influence of technology\nand social media will grow, not shrink. Now is the time to address social anxiety. And here's how. The first and maybe easiest thing\nwe can do is identify early. Early detection is critical because of those who go on\nto develop social anxiety disorder, more than half will have developed it\nbefore their 14th birthday. More than half. And social anxiety puts people at risk for developing other\nmental illnesses later on. Of adults who were diagnosed\nwith both social anxiety disorder and a mood disorder like depression, social anxiety came first\n70 percent of the time. Of adults who were diagnosed\nwith both social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder, social anxiety came first. It was developed first approximately\n80 percent of the time. What these data suggests\nis that social anxiety starts early, and it puts people at risk\nfor developing other mental illnesses. But here's the incredible part. Social anxiety can be reliably\nand accurately flagged by asking just a few simple questions. Questions like: \"Is your fear of rejection\namong one of your worst fears?\" And \"Does your fear of rejection\nget in the way of doing things that you'd otherwise\nwant to be or enjoy doing?\" The cost of asking these questions\nis like 30 seconds and zero dollars. We don't have to create\nnew infrastructures. We don't have to upend existing ones. We can embed early detection programs\ninto our existing structures like at schools, new year orientation, one-on-one counselor meetings and in primary care settings. Because if a doctor\ncan screen for depression, then she can also screen\nfor social anxiety. Early detection and then appropriately intervening can significantly alter\nthe trajectories of young people. The second thing we can do\nis harness our platforms. One of the benefits of living\nin this hyperconnected world is that a single person\ncan have a ton of power. They can use their platforms to create\nmeaningful and lasting social change. I mentioned Ricky Williams and Osaka, who have used their platforms to share\nabout their social anxiety. And just from these two people,\nwe’ve seen a ripple effect. In response to Osaka's announcement, Viola Davis, Oscar, Emmy, Tony-award winning actress, shared that she struggles\nwith social anxiety. A woman whose job it is as an actress to embody and express\nthe complexities of people in very vulnerable and very public ways. But frankly, these celebrities are not\nthe poster children for social anxiety. They're just three\nof the millions who suffer, who were brave enough to talk about it. And we can do the same with our platforms,\nhowever big or small. In our schools, in our workplaces, in our communities and in our homes. Because regular, candid and forthcoming\nconversations about mental illness ultimately reduce stigma, correct harmful myths and get people the help that they need. The last thing that we can do\nis foster social courage. Addressing social anxiety is not\nabout preventing or avoiding rejection. Addressing social anxiety\nis about fostering social courage. Being socially courageous\nmeans pursuing experiences and knowing that your chances\nof rejection are not zero. In fact, the chances that you get rejected\nat some point in your life, at some point this year, are high. And worse, you may be rejected\nas a function of who you are. Things about yourself\nthat you cannot change. Where you come from, what you look like or who you love. Being socially courageous\nmeans pursuing experiences because they are important to you and knowing that the successes\nof those pursuits are not contingent\non your worth as a human being. Being socially courageous\nmeans knowing your worth and finding people and social groups that love and accept that person. And being socially courageous\nmeans asking that person out, applying for that job, speaking up at that meeting or that party or giving that big talk on that big stage, knowing that rejection lurks\naround the corner. But the opportunity for growth\nand for purpose shines brighter. A purpose not defined by ensuring\nthat you go unnoticed in this world, but a purpose that makes you feel\nmost alive, most present and most authentically you.

(Laughter) It was my first time eating\nNigerian \"jollof.\" (Laughter) Actually, in all seriousness, I was going through a lot\nof personal turmoil. Faced with enormous stress, I suffered an anxiety attack. On some days, I could do no work. On other days, I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry. My doctor asked if I'd like to speak\nwith a mental health professional about my stress and anxiety. Mental health? I clammed up and violently\nshook my head in protest. I felt a profound sense of a shame. I felt the weight of stigma. I have a loving, supportive family and incredibly loyal friends, yet I could not entertain\nthe idea of speaking to anyone about my feeling of pain. I felt suffocated\nby the rigid architecture of our African masculinity. \"People have real problems, Sangu. Get over yourself!\" The first time I heard \"mental health,\" I was a boarding school student\nfresh off the boat from Ghana, at the Peddie School in New Jersey. I had just gone through\nthe brutal experience of losing seven loved ones\nin the same month.

(Laughter) Like Okonkwo in \"Things Fall Apart,\" we African men neither process\nnor express our emotions. We deal with our problems. (Applause) We deal with our problems. I called my brother and laughed\nabout \"Oyibo\" people -- white people -- and their strange diseases -- depression, ADD and those \"weird things.\" Growing up in West Africa, when people used the term \"mental,\"\nwhat came to mind was a madman with dirty, dread-locked hair, bumbling around half-naked on the streets.

According to the World\nHealth Organization, mental health is about being able to cope with the normal stressors of life; to work productively and fruitfully; and to be able to make\na contribution to your community. Mental health includes our emotional,\npsychological and social well-being. Globally, 75 percent\nof all mental illness cases can be found in low-income countries. Yet most African governments invest less than one percent\nof their health care budget in mental health. Even worse, we have a severe shortage\nof psychiatrists in Africa. Nigeria, for example,\nis estimated to have 200 -- in a country of almost 200 million. In all of Africa, 90 percent of our people\nlack access to treatment. As a result, we suffer in solitude, silenced by stigma. We as Africans often respond\nto mental health with distance, ignorance, guilt, fear and anger. In a study conducted by Arboleda-Flórez, directly asking, \"What is the cause\nof mental illness?\" 34 percent of Nigerian respondents\ncited drug misuse; 19 percent said divine wrath\nand the will of God -- (Laughter) 12 percent, witchcraft and spiritual possession. But few cited other known\ncauses of mental illness, like genetics, socioeconomic status, war, conflict or the loss of a loved one. The stigmatization against mental illness often results in the ostracizing\nand demonizing of sufferers. Photojournalist Robin Hammond\nhas documented some of these abuses ... in Uganda, in Somalia, and here in Nigeria. For me, the stigma is personal. In 2009, I received a frantic call\nin the middle of the night. My best friend in the world -- a brilliant, philosophical,\ncharming, hip young man -- was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I witnessed some of the friends\nwe'd grown up with recoil. I heard the snickers. I heard the whispers. \"Did you hear he has gone mad?\" (Kru English) \"He has gone crazy!\" Derogatory, demeaning commentary\nabout his condition -- words we would never say\nabout someone with cancer or someone with malaria. Somehow, when it comes to mental illness, our ignorance eviscerates all empathy. I stood by his side\nas his community isolated him, but our love never wavered. Tacitly, I became passionate\nabout mental health. Inspired by his plight, I helped found the mental health\nspecial interest alumni group at my college. And during my tenure as a resident\ntutor in graduate school, I supported many undergraduates\nwith their mental health challenges. I saw African students struggle and unable to speak to anyone. Even with this knowledge\nand with their stories in tow, I, in turn, struggled, and could not speak to anyone\nwhen I faced my own anxiety, so deep is our fear of being the madman. All of us -- but we Africans especially -- need to realize that our mental struggles\ndo not detract from our virility, nor does our trauma taint our strength. We need to see mental health\nas important as physical health. We need to stop suffering in silence. We must stop stigmatizing disease and traumatizing the afflicted. Talk to your friends. Talk to your loved ones. Talk to health professionals. Be vulnerable. Do so with the confidence that you are not alone. Speak up if you're struggling. Being honest about how we feel does not make us weak; it makes us human. It is time to end the stigma\nassociated with mental illness. So the next time your hear \"mental,\" do not just think of the madman. Think of me. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

What is it about these connections\nthat make them so unique? Before we dive into the science, \nlet’s first observe one in action. If I could somehow design\na best friend, you know, put together all the ideal qualities\nof my perfect match, that person would pale \nin comparison to Priya. She can turn any situation \ninto a good time— chemistry lab, band practice. What I’m trying to say is I never laugh\nharder than when I’m with Priya. And she’s always there for me. Like last year after I got dumped by Te—\nyou know what? I don’t even want to mention their name. It felt like my whole world\nwas crashing down. But as soon as I told Priya, boom,\nshe was at my door. I was a wreck, \nbut she sat there with me and listened. We’re always on the same page; it’s as if we can read each other’s minds! And we can talk for hours— about anything. I know my mom would say she has\nthe phone bills to prove it. If it seems like friendships formed\nin adolescence are particularly special, that’s because they are. Early childhood, adolescent, \nand adult friendships all manifest a little differently in part because the brain works \nin different ways at those stages of life. Adolescence is a unique time when\npeer relationships take focus, and thanks to the developing brain, there are changes in the way you value, \nunderstand, and connect to friends. Teenage friends can seem\nattached at the hip. Scientists describe adolescence\nas a social reorientation as teenagers begin to spend \nas much or more time with their friends \nthan with their parents. This drive to hang with pals may be due \nto changes in the brain’s reward center, known as the ventral striatum. Its activation makes hanging\nout with others enjoyable and motivates you to spend\nmore time with them. Neuroimaging studies show that this region\nis highly reactive during your teenage years, which may explain why adolescents \nseem to place a higher value on social interactions \nthan children or adults. Teenage friendships can also\nfeel more intimate than the friendships of your childhood. This deeper connection is possible thanks\nto improvements in what scientists call Theory of Mind. Theory of Mind is the ability \nto understand others’ emotions, thoughts, motivations, and points of view, and to realize that they may\nbe different from your own. While it may seem intuitive, this ability hinges on the careful\ncoordination of various brain regions, sometimes referred to as the social brain. Babies begin to develop Theory of Mind\naround 18 months or so. Before that, it’s thought they believe\nthat everyone perceives and knows exactly what they know. It was once considered to be \nfully developed by age five, but scientists now know \nthat Theory of Mind continues to improve and mature\nwell into your teenage years and beyond. Likewise, regions within the social brain\nshow increased connectivity during adolescence compared \nwith childhood. As a result, teens can better understand\ntheir friend’s perspectives, allowing for deeper connections \nto flourish. In the closest friendships, it can almost feel as if you’re\nmetaphysically connected— two bodies and minds, perfectly in sync. And there is science to this! Your ability to connect with others\nsomewhat depends on the coordination of actions, emotions,\nphysiology, and thoughts. This is what psychologists call\ninterpersonal synchrony. You first show signs of the ability\nto sync with others as infants— synchronizing movements \nand babbling with your parents. As you get older and spend more time \noutside the home, you increasingly show this synchrony\nwith your peers. For example, imagine walking\ndown the street with a friend. Often without consciously thinking, you stroll at the same pace\nand follow the same path. You and your best friend may \nnot be only on the same page, but also scientifically, in step."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "According to the video, which age is particularly special when it comes to friendship?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Early childhood"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Adolescence "}, {"label": "C", "text": "Early adulthood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Middle age"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which part of the brain is know as the reward center?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hypothalamus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Amygdala"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ventral Striatum"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Frontal lobe"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is Theory of Mind?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The ability to understand other people's emotions, thoughts, motivations, and points of view"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The ability to recognize yourself in the mirror"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The ability to grasp abstract concepts"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The ability to visualize the future"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "According to the video, people begin to develop Theory of Mind around:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "6 months"}, {"label": "B", "text": "18 months"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2 years old"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5 years old"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Your ability to connect with others depends on:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Actions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Emotions and Thoughts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Physiology "}, {"label": "D", "text": "A coordination of all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Aaronson", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-causes-panic-attacks-and-how-can-you-prevent-them-cindy-j-aaronson", "transcript": {"en": "The body becomes its own corset. Past, present, and future \nexist as a single force. A swing without gravity soars \nto a terrifying height. The outlines of people and things \ndissolve. Countless poets and writers \nhave tried to put words to the experience of a panic attack— a sensation so overwhelming, many people \nmistake it for a heart attack, stroke, or other life-threatening crisis. Though panic attacks don’t cause \nlong-term physical harm, afterwards, the fear of another attack \ncan limit someone’s daily life— and cause more panic attacks. Studies suggest that almost a third of us will experience at least one \npanic attack in our lives. And whether it’s your first, \nyour hundredth, or you’re witnessing someone else \ngo through one, no one wants to repeat the experience. Even learning about them can \nbe uncomfortable, but it’s necessary— because the first step to preventing \npanic attacks is understanding them. At its core, a panic attack \nis an overreaction to the body’s normal physiological response \nto the perception of danger. This response starts with the amygdala, the brain region involved \nin processing fear. When the amygdala perceives danger, it stimulates \nthe sympathetic nervous system, which triggers the release of adrenaline. Adrenaline prompts an increase \nin the heart and breathing rate to get blood and oxygen \nto the muscles of the arms and legs. This also sends oxygen to the brain, \nmaking it more alert and responsive. During a panic attack, this response is exaggerated \nwell past what would be useful in a dangerous situation, causing a racing heart, heavy breathing, \nor hyperventilation. The changes to blood flow \ncause lightheadedness and numbness in the hands and feet. A panic attack usually peaks \nwithin 10 minutes. Then, the prefrontal cortex \ntakes over from the amygdala and stimulates \nthe parasympathetic nervous system. This triggers the release of a hormone \ncalled acetylcholine that decreases the heart rate \nand gradually winds down the panic attack. In a panic attack, the body’s \nperception of danger is enough to trigger the response we would\nhave to a real threat— and then some. We don't know for sure \nwhy this happens, but sometimes cues in the environment \nthat remind us of traumatic past experience \ncan trigger a panic attack. Panic attacks can be part \nof anxiety disorders like PTSD, social anxiety disorder, OCD, \nand generalized anxiety disorder. Recurring panic attacks, \nfrequent worry about new attacks, and behavioral changes \nto avoid panic attacks can lead to a diagnosis \nof a panic disorder. The two main treatments \nfor panic disorder are antidepressant medication \nand cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. Both have about a 40% response rate— though someone who responds to one \nmay not respond to the other. However, antidepressant medications \ncarry some side effects, and 50% of people relapse \nwhen they stop taking them. CBT, meanwhile, is more lasting, \nwith only a 20% relapse rate. The goal of CBT treatment for panic \ndisorder is to help people learn and practice concrete tools \nto exert physical, and in turn mental, control over the sensations and thoughts \nassociated with a panic attack. CBT begins with an explanation of the \nphysiological causes of a panic attack, followed by breath and muscle exercises \ndesigned to help people consciously control breathing patterns. Next comes cognitive restructuring, which involves identifying \nand changing the thoughts that are common during attacks— such as believing you’ll stop breathing, \nhave a heart attack, or die— and replacing them \nwith more accurate thoughts. The next stage of treatment is exposure \nto the bodily sensations and situations that typically trigger a panic attack. The goal is to change the belief, \nthrough experience, that these sensations and situations \nare dangerous. Even after CBT, taking these steps \nisn’t easy in the grip of an attack. But with practice, these tools \ncan both prevent and de-escalate attacks, and ultimately reduce the hold of panic \non a person’s life. Outside formal therapy, many panickers find relief from the same \nbeliefs CBT aims to instill: that fear can’t hurt you, \nbut holding on to it will escalate panic. Even if you’ve never had a panic attack, understanding them will help you identify \none in yourself or someone else— and recognizing them is the first step \nin preventing them."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How frequently do panic attacks occur in the population?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "98%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What part of the brain controls our fear response?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Amygdala"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Frontal Cortex"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hippocampus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Brain Stem"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following are true in panic disorder?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fear of getting another panic attack for at least one month"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Having daily panic attacks is required for the diagnosis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A and D"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Avoiding at least one situation for fear of getting a panic attack"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What treatments are effective for panic disorder?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nutritional supplements"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exercise"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Antidepressant Medication (ADM)"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both CBT and ADM"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The main goals of CBT are to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Learn to manage bodily sensations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Change your thinking"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Learn to stop fearing and avoiding situations that previously invoked panic attacks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Lynchings like these were happening \nall over the American South, often without any subsequent legal \ninvestigation or consequences for the murderers. But this time, a young journalist and \nfriend of the victims set out to expose the truth \nabout these killings. Her reports would shock the nation and launch her career as an \ninvestigative journalist, civic leader, and civil rights advocate. Her name was Ida B. Wells. Ida Bell Wells was born into slavery \nin Holly Springs, Mississippi on July 16, 1862, several months before\nthe Emancipation Proclamation released her and her family. After losing both parents and a brother \nto yellow fever at the age of 16, she supported her five remaining siblings by working as a schoolteacher \nin Memphis, Tennessee. During this time, she began working as a journalist. Writing under the pen name “Iola,” by the early 1890s she gained \na reputation as a clear voice against racial injustice and become co-owner and editor of the Memphis Free Speech \nand Headlight newspaper. She had no shortage of material: in the decades following the Civil War, Southern whites attempted to reassert \ntheir power by committing crimes against Black people including suppressing their votes, vandalizing their businesses, \nand even murdering them. After the murder of her friends, Wells launched an investigation \ninto lynching. She analyzed specific cases through \nnewspaper reports and police records, and interviewed people who had lost \nfriends and family to lynch mobs. She risked her life \nto get this information. As a Black person investigating racially \nmotivated murders, she enraged many of the same southern \nwhite men involved in lynchings. Her bravery paid off. Most whites had claimed and \nsubsequently reported that lynchings were responses to criminal\nacts by Black people. But that was not usually the case. Through her research, Wells showed that these murders \nwere actually a deliberate, brutal tactic to control or punish \nblack people who competed with whites. Her friends, for example, had been lynched when their grocery store became popular enough to divert business \nfrom a white competitor. Wells published her findings in 1892. In response, a white mob destroyed \nher newspaper presses. She was out of town when they struck, but they threatened to kill her \nif she ever returned to Memphis. So she traveled to New York, where that same year she re-published \nher research in a pamphlet titled Southern Horrors: Lynch Law \nin All Its Phases. In 1895, after settling in Chicago, she built on Southern Horrors in a longer \npiece called The Red Record. Her careful documentation of the horrors \nof lynching and impassioned public speeches \ndrew international attention. Wells used her newfound fame \nto amplify her message. She traveled to Europe, where she rallied European outrage against\nracial violence in the American South in hopes that the US government and public\nwould follow their example. Back in the US, she didn’t hesitate to confront powerful \norganizations, fighting the segregationist \npolicies of the YMCA and leading a delegation \nto the White House to protest discriminatory \nworkplace practices. She did all this while \ndisenfranchised herself. Women didn’t win the right to vote \nuntil Wells was in her late 50s. And even then, the vote was primarily \nextended to white women only. Wells was a key player in the battle \nfor voting inclusion, starting a Black women’s \nsuffrage organization in Chicago. But in spite of her deep commitment \nto women’s rights, she clashed with white leaders \nof the movement. During a march for women’s \nsuffrage in Washington D.C., she ignored the organizers’ attempt \nto placate Southern bigotry by placing Black women in the back, and marched up front alongside\nthe white women. She also chafed with other \ncivil rights leaders, who saw her as a dangerous radical. She insisted on airing, in full detail, \nthe atrocities taking place in the South, while others thought doing so would be \ncounterproductive to negotiations with white politicians. Although she participated in the founding \nof the NAACP, she was soon sidelined \nfrom the organization. Wells’ unwillingness to compromise any \naspect of her vision of justice shined a light on the weak points \nof the various rights movements, and ultimately made them stronger— but also made it difficult for her \nto find a place within them. She was ahead of her time, waging a tireless struggle \nfor equality and justice decades before many had even begun \nto imagine it possible."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Ida B Wells was born into slavery in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Chicago, IL"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Birmingham, AL"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Holly Springs, MS"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Selma, AL"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Jackson, MS"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In an effort to end discriminatory hiring practices, Wells led a delegation to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Capitol Building"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The White House"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Statue of Liberty"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wall Street"}, {"label": "E", "text": "The Liberty Bell"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Wells was a founding member of which civil rights organization:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "SNCC"}, {"label": "B", "text": "AARP"}, {"label": "C", "text": "NAACP"}, {"label": "D", "text": "National Urban League"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Ida B.

I want to watch the sky change\nand turn orange and pink and purple as day dies into night. I want to hear the wind\nfluttering through the leaves and smell very faintly,\nnag champa amber incense, but very faintly, because scent\ncan be tough on a dying body. I want to die with socks on my feet\nbecause I get cold. And if I die with a bra on,\nI'm coming to haunt everybody. (Laughter) I will terrorize you\nand that is a threat, OK? I want to die in my own bed,\nat my own home, with my loved ones nearby who are talking amongst themselves\nand comforting each other for this very big thing\nthat's about to happen in their lives. I want to die with all my affairs in order so my loved ones\nhave nothing to worry about but their grief after I die. I want to die empty, devoid of all of the skill, gift, talent and light that I carry in this body and satiated, full of the richness\nof this one unique human ride. And when my loved ones notice\nthat I have released my last breath, I want them to clap. I want them to clap because I died well, but I died well only because I lived well. Now, will it happen this way? Probably not. Realistically, I mean, even\nwith all this rah-rah death talk I talk, I'm probably going to go\nkicking and screaming. (Laughter) Unless we choose, the date, place, manner and time of our death\nwill remain a mystery. Then why think about it at all? Death creates context for our lives. My entire life is leading up\nuntil that point. How we die creates the period\nat the end of the sentence, but it is the period that makes\nit a sentence at all. Imagine for a moment your 847th birthday. OK, try. I mean, you're probably pushing\n30, 40, 50, 60, 70 in this room. Imagine 847 of them. So you’re sitting there\nand your body is raggedy. Because unless they cure aging, I promise you, you do not\nwant to be immortal. I promise, you're going\nto be begging for death. So it's your 847th birthday. Here they come with a cake. No candles on it, because it would\nburn the house down. And now here they come,\nsinging that same tired song. \"Happy birthday to you,\"\nyou would be so over it. And if it was a Stevie Wonder version,\nthat song is already 45 minutes long, you'd be extra over it. (Laughter) Nobody wants that. We count birthdays now\nbecause they're finite. They're special. They mark the passage of time,\nand one day, we won't have any more time. And I find that to be\na really useful fact. I think it's healthy for us\nto think about our death. And you might say, of course I do,\nbecause I'm a death doula. I wanted us to embrace thinking\nabout our mortality. I spend a lot of time thinking about,\ntalking about, helping people prepare and teaching death doulas. Death doulas offer non-medical\nand holistic care for the dying person, the circle of support\nand the community through the process. I want to acknowledge first\nwhat a privilege it is for people to be able to know about\nand afford and hire a death doula. We're working on it. And next, what a privilege it is for me to even be able to imagine my own death. It says that I have a sense of safety. My basic bodily needs are met. And I have safety in my body,\nmy mind and in my life, even despite the skin I wear. That wasn't always the case. I came to this work by serendipity, by circumstance, but mostly by necessity. A little over ten years ago, I was practicing law at the Legal\nAid Foundation of Los Angeles, and I grew depressed. Not like, \"Oh my God, I'm so depressed,\" but like, for real depressed,\nlike, \"can't get out of bed\" depressed, \"can't shower\" depressed,\ncan't find hope, \"can find a smile,\nbut can't really find joy,\" type of depressed. I took a medical leave of absence,\nso I went to Cuba, and I met a woman there, a fellow traveler on the bus,\nwho had uterine cancer. We spent the 14-hour bus ride talking\nabout her life and also her death. And it was a highly\nilluminating conversation. I heard firsthand how hard it was for her to even be able to talk about her fears\naround mortality and her disease because people censored\ntheir own discomfort with mortality rather than make space for her. I took the invitation, however,\nto think about my mortality and looked at my life from the perspective\nof my death for the very first time. And it was grim,\nI did not like what I saw. I noticed then that I had to live life on my own terms because I was the only one who was going\nto have to contend with all the choices that I'd made at my death. Not long after I came back from Cuba, my brother-in-law,\nPeter Saint John, became ill. And not too long after that,\nthey couldn't cure him anymore. So I went to New York, where he and my sister\nand my niece were, and along with Peter's family\nand my family and his friends, we ushered him to the end of his life. Being present for Peter's death is one of the greatest gifts\nI've ever been given. Not only did I get to care for somebody\nwho I loved so dearly, but it also grew my capacity\nfor compassion. I knew, intellectually, that there were\nthousands of other people that were walking through\nthe same thing at the same time. And it also hinted at the things\nthat I've been talking about in Cuba. Everybody was uncomfortable\nwith the fact that he was going to die, even the medical care team. I knew that there should be somebody, somebody who was there,\nsomebody who could be with us to walk alongside us. Somebody who could listen to us,\noffer resources, hold our hands, hold our hearts, bear witness to our pain,\nhelp us sort through information, tell us that we were doing\nthe best that we could with the worst that we were dealt. But I couldn't find anybody. So I became that someone for other people. I sit deep in the trench with folks\nas they prepare for death. There's no fixing or saving anything because there's no fixing\nor saving grief or death. It just is, I meet people\nwhere they are at. My goal is to help them\nanswer the question: \"What must I do to be at peace with myself so that I may live presently\nand die gracefully, holding both at the same time?\" When I'm thinking about my present life from the vantage point\nof my graceful death, I can see very clearly who I want to be, how I want to spend my time and what of me I'll leave behind. It allows me to consciously\ncurate my life right now and also figure out\nmy little \"whys\" right now. Because what are we waiting for, anyway? Like, death? I used to think dying people\nhad it all figured out, though. I used to think that they'd lay there\nwith their hands like this because we all know this is like,\nuniversal dying person pose. So they'd lay there\nwith their hands like this, and there'd be a little\nglimmer in their eye, they'd be like, \"Oh, yes, finally,\nit all makes sense.\" Turns out it's not like that at all,\nit doesn't look like that. Hollywood has lied to us,\nwe know that already. Cinderella was unconscionable,\nbut this is just flagrant. It's not like that at all. It's way too much work to be doing\nwhile you're dying. So it doesn't look like that,\nthere's no secret, there's nothing magically\nyou'll find out then. This is it, there's nothing to figure out,\nno big secret at all. Many of my clients also reached\nthe end of their lives wishing that they had more time. But I'm always curious,\nmore time for what? What else would they do\nwith the time that they had? It's rarely to go see Machu Picchu,\nOK, I'll tell you that. Can I tell you a story? OK, so this client is a composite, very many clients shoved together\nbecause as juicy as their stories are, it's not my responsibility\nor job to tell them. So this is many clients together, and I find that it's an easy\ncomposite to make because it's universally applicable. This applies whether or not somebody\nhas worked their entire life or sits on a big trust fund\nor works three jobs to keep the lights on. You might find bits\nof yourself in this story. This client is somebody who had\na decent amount of privilege, but not without adversity, of course,\nbecause she's human. She had a great job, great career,\nhad been a real trailblazer. Kids who she loved, who she was proud of, good friends, traveled a bunch, did a bunch of great things in her life,\nhad plenty of romance and love. She was doing OK. The girl who had everything. And then came a plot twist. That plot twist\nwas an aggressive bone cancer that was likely going to kill her. And with that plot twist came a sense\nof pointlessness to her life. She couldn’t figure out what she’d been\ndoing for the past 60-odd years because she'd been so busy doing. While she was healthy, it was about the next career milestone\nor what's happening with the kids next or the next trip. When she was sick, more of the same. Next doctor's appointment,\nnext scan, next medication. She was so busy distracting herself\nfrom like, the difficulty that she found in her life, staying out of her body so that she didn't have to be present\nwith what was going on. It was always out there,\nshe was always looking out there. But death was coming to remind her\nthat she had no more \"out theres.\" That it was always only right here, where there is nothing at all to do but simply to be. We zoomed out on her life\nto look at what she enjoyed, to see where she placed value, because from there we can figure out\nwhere we place meaning. And it turns out it wasn't about the kids\nor the work or the money. It was about the little things. Her hands in the soil. Her garden. Building a fire, reading books and food. She loved to eat, but she had dieted most of her adult life. The sound at all familiar to anybody? OK, if it does, this is for you, OK? If you take nothing away, hear this: you are going to die,\nso please eat the cake. Eat the cake, order the dessert, eat the french fries, eat the brownies. Eat everything you want to, just eat it,\nbecause you're going to die. One day, you won't be able to anymore. At this point in her disease process,\nchemotherapy had ravaged her taste buds, so she had to rely on her sense of smell\nto get pleasure out of eating. And she ate. She did it as much as she could because she knew she wouldn't\nbe able to for much longer. She ate as much as cancer would allow, and when her body\ncould no longer process food, we placed her favorite\npassion fruit soufflé right on her lip, and she would lick it and smile. She lived more in the last\neight months or so of her life with the help of hospice\nthan she had before. She was finally present,\nat home in her body, delighting in the richness\nof the sensory experience we have by virtue of these fantastical bodies\nthat we will die in. These bodies that we will die in. She was also really curious\nabout her legacy. What, if anything, she'd leave behind. But leaving a legacy isn't optional. We're doing it every single day. You're doing it with every smile,\nevery word, every kind word, every harsh word, every action, every inaction,\nevery dollar you spend. You're telling the people\nwho are paying attention exactly who you are, and that is what they'll tell of you\nwhen you are gone. At her funeral, despite all of her career accomplishments,\nnobody talked about any of that. They talked about who she was,\nnobody cared about what she'd done. When we focus on our productivity, we highlight what we have\nto do to feel worthy, rather than who we get to be, where worthiness is our birthright and we are human. (Applause) We're human. Messily, magically, fantastically, beautifully, briefly, perfectly human. Now humans are meaning-making machines. We can make a story out of anything\nand make it sound good. So why not then make meaning\nout of the magic of the mundane? And absolve ourselves\nof the responsibility of trying to have some grand life purpose? Why not just give ourselves\npermission to be fully human, to be fallible, to be messy,\nto be here while we're here? I mean, is nobody else\ntripping out over the fact that we're on a giant blue rock\nspinning through space? Y'all don't trip about that,\nbecause I do regularly. (Laughter) And then what really trips me out\nis that while that's going on, we're getting bent\nout of shape over traffic. Please let the cars merge, OK? Can we agree universally\nwe're going to let people merge? Let them merge, let them merge. Let them merge. It requires nothing of you,\njust to give them a little bit of time. And in fact, it's probably taking\nmore time off your life by all the high blood pressure\nwhen you don't want to let them merge. Just let them in, it'll be fine,\neverybody's fine, it's OK. Hold life lightly. We've got to hold life\nreally, really lightly. We are all dying. We're all dying. Now I can understand why people\nmaybe don't want to talk about death or think about it. It's uncomfortable. It's sad, it's scary, icky. Acknowledging your death means\nthat you are not the center of the story, and that is disquieting\nto the very fragile human ego. Acknowledging your mortality also means\nacknowledging our powerlessness and lack of control we have in life. Also icky. It also means surrendering\nto the big \"I don't knows\" of life and also the really big \"I don't knows\" of \"what, if anything,\nhappens after we die?\" But since we don't know, why not imagine something absurd, something glorious, something huge? A vision that actually serves you rather than makes you\nwant to recoil in fear. We could. You want to hear my working theory? It's absurd, OK? And please remember, even though I might\nkind of look like Miss Cleo, I don't know anything about what happens\nafter we die, alright? This is just an idea, OK. So I'm on my deathbed. On the outside, they are clapping. On the inside -- well, I've hit\nmy death pose, all right? I'm in my death pose. On the inside, I'm starting to feel\neverything I ever felt in this body, all at the same time. It's all starting to gather up\nin my body all at the same time. Like that one time I was 11\nand I stepped on a frog. I mean, poor frog, and I felt so bad, but I was barefoot, ew, like, I can still feel it\nsquishing up between my toes. Yuck. (Laughter) When you bite into an orange\nand the juice squirts into your mouth, and then there's the little\nbite in your jaw, there's a little bite in your jaw\nbecause it's sour. Or when you first bite\ninto a fried plantain. Or getting into clean sheets,\nthat feeling gathering in my body, all the feelings,\ngetting into a hot shower, listening to a song that you love\nfor the very first time, I'm hearing Stevie Wonder \"As\" playing, how I feel my spirit\nwhen I see the color yellow. Just all these feelings\nare starting to roll up in my body. My niece’s laughter, my nephew\ntrying to teach me how to Dougie. It did not go well. It didn't go well,\nI still don't know how to do it. How I can look into my partner's eyes and just by looking into his eyes,\nI can feel love in my body. All these feelings are starting\nto gather up in my body. At the same time, I'm also feeling\nevery little bit of pain I've ever felt physically and emotionally. I'm feeling all the sensations,\nI'm feeling anger, feeling rage, feeling frustration,\nfeeling grief, feeling sadness, feeling all those things\ngathering up in my body. I'm feeling despair, desperation, sadness. I'm feeling insecurity. All the crippling doubt, I'm feeling all the failures,\nall the disappointments. Every single time I thought\nI couldn't make it through the day, It's all starting to gather up in my body. I'm also remembering\nevery single time I did get up. So I'm also feeling all the hope, all the joy, all the awe, all the mystery, all the freedom that I feel in this body. But most of all, I'm also\nfeeling all of the love, all the aching love\nthat underwrites it all. And when I cannot take it anymore, I am saturated with this\nexperience that I've had, poof, I explode into a cosmic orgasm. Audience: Yes! AA: Yes. And like a pinata that's broken open, pieces of glitter start\nto fall from the sky. Glitter confetti, falling, falling. Orange, pink, purple,\nyellow, turquoise, everything. Gold, silver, falling, falling, falling,\nlike a really soft snow shower. Falling everywhere. In larger concentrations\non the people who loved me. And in lesser concentration\non those people whose lives I touched. And then the rest of it\njust gets reabsorbed into a big undulating glitter wave that goes on all around\nas far as I can see, for all of eternity that envelops\nand encompasses us all. Maybe it's just glitter. Could it be? It could be anything. All I know is at that point,\nall I believe is at that point, when the glitter, all the pieces of me\nhave been reencompassed, the I that I think of myself as, Alua Adwoba Arthur, having this one single\nsolitary human experience, has been reenveloped\ninto all that ever was and all that ever will be, And it is complete. And I am safe. I am still far from where I was in Cuba. At that point, my death\nwould have come as a relief. An ending to my pain and to my suffering and a way out of this life that I couldn't\nquite figure out how to get into. If I'm to die today, I know that my death\nwill come as a celebration. As a culmination of a life\nlived in and loved. A life that's worth dying from. After the last decade\nspent supporting people as they think through their lives\nand prepare for their death, I know, I trust that the real gift\nin being with our mortality is the sheer wonder that we live at all. That's all I got. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

I was from a low-income community,\nI had grown up in Mississippi, we'd moved from Mississippi to Georgia so my parents could pursue their degrees\nas United Methodist ministers. We were poor, but they didn't think\nwe were poor enough, so they were going for permanent poverty. (Laughter) And so, while they studied at Emory, I studied at Avondale,\nand I became valedictorian. Well, one of the joys of being\nvaledictorian in the state of Georgia is that you get invited\nto meet the governor of Georgia. I was mildly interested in meeting him. It was kind of cool. I was more intrigued by the fact\nthat he lived in a mansion, because I watched a lot\nof \"General Hospital\" and \"Dynasty\" as a child. (Laughter) And so I got up that morning,\nready to go to visit the governor. My mom and my dad,\nwho were also invited, got up, and we went outside. But we didn't get in our car. And in the South,\na car is a necessary thing. We don't have a lot of public transit,\nthere aren't a lot of options. But if you're lucky enough\nto live in a community where you don't have a car, the only option is public transit. And that's what we had to take. And so we got on the bus. And we took the bus from Decatur\nall the way to Buckhead, where the Governor's Mansion sat\non this really beautiful acreage of land, with these long black gates\nthat ran the length of the property. We get to the Governor's Mansion, we pull the little lever\nthat lets them know this is our stop, we get off the bus, my mom, my dad and I,\nwe walk across the street. We walk up the driveway,\nbecause there are cars coming up, cars bringing in students\nfrom all across the state of Georgia. So we're walking along the side. And as we walk single file along the side, my mom and dad sandwiching me to make sure\nI don't get hit by one of the cars bringing in the other valedictorians, we approach the guard gate. When we get to the guard gate,\nthe guard comes out. He looks at me,\nand he looks at my parents, and he says, \"You don't belong here,\nthis is a private event.\" My dad says, \"No, this is my daughter,\nStacey. She's one of the valedictorians.\" But the guard doesn't look\nat the checklist that's in his hands. He doesn't ask my mom for the invitation that's at the bottom\nof her very voluminous purse. Instead, he looks\nover our shoulder at the bus, because in his mind, the bus is telling\nhim a story about who should be there. And the fact that we were too poor\nto have our own car -- that was a story he told himself. And he may have seen\nsomething in my skin color, he may have seen something in my attire; I don't know what went through his mind. But his conclusion was\nto look at me again, and with a look of disdain, say, \"I told you, this is a private event.\nYou don't belong here.\" Now, my parents were studying to become\nUnited Methodist ministers, but they were not pastors yet. (Laughter) And so they proceeded\nto engage this gentleman in a very robust discussion\nof his decision-making skills. (Laughter) My father may have mentioned that he was going to spend eternity\nin a very fiery place if he didn't find my name\non that checklist. And indeed, the man checks\nthe checklist eventually, and he found my name,\nand he let us inside. But I don't remember meeting\nthe governor of Georgia. I don't recall meeting\nmy fellow valedictorians from 180 school districts. The only clear memory I have of that day was a man standing in front\nof the most powerful place in Georgia, looking at me and telling me\nI don't belong. And so I decided, 20-some-odd years later, to be the person\nwho got to open the gates. (Cheers) (Applause) Unfortunately, you may have read\nthe rest of the story. It didn't quite work out that way. And now I'm tasked with figuring out:\nHow do I move forward? Because, you see, I didn't just want\nto open the gates for young black women who had been underestimated\nand told they don't belong. I wanted to open those gates\nfor Latinas and for Asian Americans. I wanted to open those gates\nfor the undocumented and the documented. I wanted to open those gates\nas an ally of the LGBTQ community. I wanted to open those gates for the families that have to call\nthemselves the victims of gun violence. I wanted to open those gates wide\nfor everyone in Georgia, because that is our state,\nand this is our nation, and we all belong here. (Cheers) (Applause) But what I recognized\nis that the first try wasn't enough. And my question became:\nHow do I move forward? How do I get beyond the bitterness\nand the sadness and the lethargy and watching an inordinate amount\nof television as I eat ice cream? (Laughter) What do I do next? And I'm going to do what I've always done. I'm going to move forward,\nbecause going backwards isn't an option and standing still is not enough. (Applause) You see, I began my race for governor by analyzing who I was\nand what I wanted to be. And there are three questions\nI ask myself about everything I do, whether it's running for office\nor starting a business; when I decided to start\nthe New Georgia Project to register people to vote; or when I started the latest action,\nFair Fight Georgia. No matter what I do,\nI ask myself three questions: What do I want? Why do I want it? And how do I get it? And in this case, I know what I want. I want change. That is what I want. But the question is: What change do I want to see? And I know that the questions\nI have to ask myself are: One, am I honest about the scope\nof my ambition? Because it's easy to figure out\nthat once you didn't get what you wanted, then maybe you should\nhave set your sights a little lower, but I'm here to tell you\nto be aggressive about your ambition. Do not allow setbacks to set you back. (Applause) Number two, let yourself\nunderstand your mistakes. But also understand their mistakes, because, as women in particular, we're taught that if something\ndoesn't work out, it's probably our fault. And usually, there is something\nwe could do better, but we've been told\nnot to investigate too much what the other side could have done. And this isn't partisan -- it's people. We're too often told\nthat our mistakes are ours alone, but victory is a shared benefit. And so what I tell you to do\nis understand your mistakes, but understand the mistakes of others. And be clearheaded about it. And be honest with yourself\nand honest with those who support you. But once you know what you want, understand why you want it. And even though it feels good,\nrevenge is not a good reason. (Laughter) Instead, make sure you want it because there's something\nnot that you should do, but something you must do. It has to be something\nthat doesn't allow you to sleep at night unless you're dreaming about it; something that wakes you up in the morning\nand gets you excited about it; or something that makes you so angry, you know you have to do\nsomething about it. But know why you're doing it. And know why it must be done. You've listened to women\nfrom across this world talk about why things have to happen. But figure out what the \"why\" is for you, because jumping from\nthe \"what\" to the \"do\" is meaningless if you don't know why. Because when it gets hard,\nwhen it gets tough, when your friends walk away from you, when your supporters forget you, when you don't win your first race -- if you don't know why,\nyou can't try again. So, first know what you want. Second, know why you want it, but third, know how\nyou're going to get it done. I faced a few obstacles in this race. (Laughter) Just a few. But in the pursuit, I became the first black woman\nto ever become the nominee for governor in the history of the United States\nof America for a major party. (Cheers) (Applause) But more importantly, in this process, we turned out 1.2 million\nAfrican American voters in Georgia. That is more voters than voted on the Democratic side\nof the ticket in 2014. (Applause) Our campaign tripled the number of Latinos who believed their voices mattered\nin the state of Georgia. We tripled the number of Asian Americans who stood up and said,\n\"This is our state, too.\" Those are successes that tell me\nhow I can get it done. But they also let me understand\nthe obstacles aren't insurmountable. They're just a little high. But I also understand that there are three things\nthat always hold us hostage. The first is finances. Now, you may have heard,\nI'm in a little bit of debt. If you didn't hear about it,\nyou did not go outside. (Laughter) And finances are something\nthat holds us back so often, our dreams are bounded\nby how much we have in resources. But we hear again and again the stories of those who overcome\nthose resource challenges. But you can't overcome\nsomething you don't talk about. And that's why I didn't allow them\nto debt-shame me in my campaign. I didn't allow anyone to tell me\nthat my lack of opportunity was a reason to disqualify\nme from running. And believe me, people tried\nto tell me I shouldn't run. Friends told me not to run. Allies told me not to run. \"USA Today\" mentioned\nmaybe I shouldn't run. (Laughter) But no matter who it was, I understood that finances are often\na reason we don't let ourselves dream. I can't say that you will always\novercome those obstacles, but I will tell you,\nyou will be damned if you do not try. (Applause) The second is fear. And fear is real. It is paralyzing. It is terrifying. But it can also be energizing, because once you know\nwhat you're afraid of, you can figure out how to get around it. And the third is fatigue. Sometimes you just get tired of trying. You get tired of reading\nabout processes and politics and the things that stop you\nfrom getting where you want to be. Sometimes, fatigue means that we accept\nposition instead of power. We let someone give us a title\nas a consolation prize, rather than realizing we know what we want\nand we're going to get it, even if we're tired. That's why God created naps. (Laughter) But we also learn in those moments that fatigue is an opportunity\nto evaluate how much we want it. Because if you are beaten down, if you have worked as hard as you can, if you have done everything\nyou said you should, and it still doesn't work out, fatigue can sap you of your energy. But that's why you go back\nto the \"why\" of it. Because I know we have to have women\nwho speak for the voiceless. I know we have to have people\nof good conscience who stand up against oppression. I know we have to have people who understand that social justice\nbelongs to us all. And that wakes me up every morning, and that makes me fight even harder. Because I am moving forward,\nknowing what is in my past. I know the obstacles they have for me. I know what they're going to do, and I'm fairly certain they're energizing\nand creating new obstacles now. But they've got four years\nto figure it out. (Laughter) (Applause) Maybe two. (Cheers) (Applause) But here's my point: I know what I want, and that is justice. I know why I want it, because poverty is immoral,\nand it is a stain on our nation. And I know how I'm going to get it: by moving forward every single day. Thank you so much. (Cheers) (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Every twig represented a person \nin his village who died because of King Leopold’s horrific regime\nin the Congo— all in the name of rubber. Chief Lontulu separated the twigs \ninto four piles: tribal nobles, men, women, and children— then proceeded\nto name the dead of one-by-one. His testimony joined hundreds of others\nto help bring an end to one of the greatest atrocities \nin history. Beginning in the late 1800s, European countries participated in the\nso-called “Scramble for Africa.” They colonized 90% of the continent, exploiting African resources \nand enriching their countries. Belgium had recently become\nan independent kingdom. Its ruler, Leopold II, \nwanted to acquire what he called “a slice of this magnificent \nAfrican cake.” Meanwhile, he read colonial explorer \nHenry Morton Stanley’s reports about traveling through Africa. Stanley emphasized \nthe Congo basin’s majesty. So, in 1879, Leopold contracted him\nto return to the Congo. There, Stanley deceived leaders \ninto signing some 450 treaties allowing for land use. Leopold persuaded the US and European\npowers to grant him ownership of the Congo, pledging to protect free trade \nin the region. And on May 29, 1885, a territory more than\n80 times the size of Belgium and home to 20 million people was declared\nhis own private colony— by no one it actually belonged to. Leopold lost no time consolidating power \nin what he called the Congo Free State. He claimed land, raised an army, and forced many Congolese men\nto complete unpaid labor. Things got even worse when, in 1887, a Scottish inventor redeveloped\nthe pneumatic tire, creating a massive international\nmarket for rubber. The Congo had one of the world’s\nlargest supplies. Leopold seized the opportunity, requiring villages to meet \never-greater rubber quotas. Congolese men had to harvest\nthe material from wild vines. As supplies drained, they walked for days\nto gather enough. Leopold’s army entered villages and held \nwomen and children hostage until the impossible quota was met. Soldiers sexually violated women \nand deprived children of food and water. Congolese people rebelled— they refused to cooperate, \nfought Leopold’s soldiers, hid in the forests, \nand destroyed rubber vines. Leopold’s army responded to resistance \nor failure to meet quotas with unflinching torture and executions. Because guns and ammunition\nwere expensive, officers ordered soldiers to prove they \nused their bullets in the line of duty by removing a hand from anyone \nthey killed. However, many soldiers hunted \nusing their guns. To avoid harsh penalties and account \nfor lost bullets, they cut off living people’s hands. They also used this practice\nas punishment. If rubber quotas weren’t met, soldiers would sever people’s hands\nand bring them to their commanders instead of rubber. The regime dramatically upended\ndaily life and agriculture, causing widespread starvation and disease. Meanwhile, King Leopold built monuments \nand private estates with the wealth he extracted. Soon, people brought international\nattention to the horrific abuses of Leopold’s Congo Free State. In 1890, American journalist \nGeorge Washington Williams accused King Leopold of “deceit, fraud, \nrobberies, arson, murder, slave-raiding,\nand [a] general policy of cruelty.” In 1903, Diplomat Roger Casement \nwrote a report that corroborated the nature and scale of the atrocities. It was published the following year. In response, Leopold appointed his own \ncommission to investigate the accusations. They heard numerous witness statements \nin the Congo— Chief Lontulu’s included. The report only confirmed the worst. Facing pressure, Leopold relinquished \ncontrol of the Congo to the Belgian government in 1908. But this did not mean justice. The Belgian state awarded Leopold\n50 million francs “in testimony for his great sacrifice \nin favor of the Congo.” He died the following year. Crowds booed his funeral procession. For more than 50 years following,\nthe Congo remained a Belgian colony, until declaring independence in 1960. That year, the Congo elected its first\nprime minister, Patrice Lumumba. But months later, he was unseated \nin a US and Belgium backed coup. In early 1961, Lumumba was assassinated \nunder Belgian supervision. The coup launched the country \ninto a decades-long dictatorship. Around 10 million Congolese people \nare thought to have died during Leopold’s occupation and looting \nof the Congo. Despite this devastation, calls \nfor reparations have gone unanswered.

She had no experience \nwith the legal system, no money, and no power \nin the eyes of the court. Ignoring the jury’s scorn, Truth said she was there to fight for\ncustody of her five-year-old son Peter, who’d been illegally sold \nto an enslaver in Alabama. As the trial played out \nover the next several months, Truth raised funds, \nstrategized with lawyers, and held her faith. Finally in the spring of 1828, \nPeter was returned to her care— but Truth’s work was far from over. She would dedicate \nthe rest of her life to pursuing justice and spiritual understanding. Truth was born into slavery \nas Isabella Baumfree in the late 18th century\nin Ulster County, New York. Although New York state had announced \nthe abolition of slavery in 1799, the emancipation act was gradual. Those who were currently enslaved were forced to serve a period of \nindentured servitude until their mid-20s. Throughout this period, \nenslavers repeatedly sold Baumfree, tearing her from her loved ones. Often, she was explicitly prevented \nfrom pursuing new relationships. Eventually, she married an enslaved man \nnamed Thomas, with whom she had three children. She was desperate to keep \nher new family together— but the slow progress of abolition \nthreatened this hope. Baumfree’s enslaver, John Dumont, \nhad promised to free her by 1826. When he failed to keep his word, \nBaumfree fled for her safety. During the escape, she was only able \nto rescue her youngest daughter Sophia, while her other children \nremained in bondage. It would be two years before \nshe regained custody of Peter. After that, she would wait \nanother two years before she saw any of her other children. During this time, \nBaumfree found solace in her faith and became increasingly dedicated \nto religious reflection. After settling in Kingston, New York, she joined a Methodist community \nthat shared her political views. She continued her practice of speaking \naloud to God in private, and one night, her evening prayers\ntook on even more sacred significance. Baumfree claimed to hear the voice \nof God, telling her to leave Kingston, and share her holy message with others. Though she never learned to read or write, Baumfree became known \nas an electrifying orator, whose speeches drew on \nBiblical references, spiritual ideals, \nand her experience of slavery. Her sermons denounced the oppression \nof African Americans and women in general, and became prominent in campaigns \nfor both abolition and women’s rights. In 1843, she renamed herself \nSojourner Truth and embarked on a legendary \nspeaking tour. Truth saw her journey \nas a mission from God. Her faith often led her \nto the nation’s most hostile regions, where she spoke to bigoted audiences \nas the only Black woman in the crowd. Truth was confident God would protect her, but some crowds responded \nto her bravery with violence. During one of her sermons, a mob of white men threatened to set \nfire to the tent where she was speaking. In her memoir, Truth recalled steeling \nherself to confront them: “Have I not faith enough to go out \nand quell that mob… I felt as if I had three hearts! And that they were so large, \nmy body could hardly hold them!” She placated the men with song and prayer,\nuntil they had no desire to harm her. Truth’s speeches impacted thousands of\npeople in communities across the nation, but her activism went far beyond\npublic speaking. During the Civil War, she became involved\nwith the Union Army, recruiting soldiers and organizing \nsupplies for Black troops.

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/we-need-to-talk-about-an-injustice-bryan-stevenson", "transcript": {"en": "[Music] [Applause] well this is a really extraordinary honor for me I spend most of my time in jails in prisons on death row I spend most of my time in very low-income communities and the projects and places where there's a great deal of hopelessness and being here at Ted and and seeing the stimulation hearing it has been very very energizing to me and one of the things that's emerged in my short time here is that Ted has an identity and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world and sometimes when it comes through Ted it has meaning and power that it doesn't have when it doesn't and I mention that because I think identity is really important and we've had some fantastic presentations and I think what we've learned is that if you're a teacher your words can be meaningful but if you're a compassionate teacher they can be especially meaningful if you're a doctor you can do some good things but if you're a caring doctor you can do some other things so I want to talk about the power of identity and I didn't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do I I I actually learned about this from my grandmother I grew up in a house uh that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch and that matriarch was my grandmother that she was tough she was strong she was powerful uh she was the end of every argument in our family uh she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family uh she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved her parents were born ens slavery in Virginia in the 1840s she was born in the 1880s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world and my mother my grandmother was tough but she was also loving when I would see her as a little boy she'd come up to me and she'd give me these hugs and she'd squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she'd let me go and an hour or two later if I saw her she'd come over to me and she'd say Brian do you still feel me hugging you and if I said no she'd assault me again and if I'd say yes she'd leave me alone and then she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her and the only challenge was that she had 10 children my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her it'd be difficult to get her time and attention my cousins would be running around everywhere and I remember uh when I was about 8 or 9 years old waking up one morning going into the living room and all of my cousins were running around and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me and at first I thought we were playing a game and I would look at her and I'd smile but she was very serious and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said come on Brian you and I going to have a talk and I remember this just like it happened yesterday and never will forget it she she took me out back and she said Brian I'm going to tell you something but you don't tell anybody what I tell you I said okay Mom she said now you you make sure you don't do that I said sure then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said I want you to know I've been watching you and she said I think you're special she said I think you can do anything you want to do I will never forget it and she then she said I just need you to promise me three things Brian I said okay Mom she said the first thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always love your mom she said that's my baby girl you have to promise me now you'll always take care of her well I adored my mom so I said yes Mama I'll do that then she said the second thing I want you to promise me is that you'll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing and I thought about it and I said yes Mama I'll do that then finally she said the third thing I want you to promise me is that you'll never drink alcohol well I was 9 years old so I saides Mama I'll do that I grew up in the country in the rural South and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister year younger when I was about uh 14 or 15 one day my brother came home and he had this six-pack of beer I don't know where he got it and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some and they offered it to me and I said no no no no that's okay y'all go ahead I'm not going to have any beer my brother said come on we're doing this today you always do what we do I had some your sister had some have some beer I said no I don't feel right about that y'all go ahead y'all go ahead and then my brother started staring at me he said what is what's wrong with you have some beer then he looked at me real hard he said oh I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you I I I said well what are you talking about he says oh mama tells all the grandkids that they're special I I I was devastated and I'm going to admit something to you I'm going to tell you something I probably shouldn't I know this is might be broadcast broadly but I'm I'm 52 years old and I'm going to admit to you that I've never had a drop of alcohol I I I don't I don't say that because I think that's virtuous I say that because there is power in identity when we create the right kind of identity we can say things to the world around us that they don't actually believe make sense we can get them to do things that they don't think they can do when I thought about my grandmother of of course she would think all her grandkids were special my grandfather was in prison during prohibition my male uncles died of alcohol rated diseases and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to well I've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago in 1972 there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons today there are 2.3 million the United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world we have 7 million people on probation and parole and mass incarceration in my judgment has fundamentally changed our world in poor communities and communities of color there is this despair there is this hopelessness that is being shaped by these outcomes one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail in prison on probation or Parole in urban communities of across this country Los Angeles Philadelphia Baltimore Washington 50 to 60% of all young men of color in jail or prison or on probation and parole our system isn't just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race they're also distorted by poverty we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent wealth not culpability shapes outcomes and yet we seem to be very very comfortable the politics of fear and anger has made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems we've been disconnected it's interesting to me we're looking at some very interesting developments in our work my state of Alabama like a a number of states actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction right now in Alabama 34% of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote we're actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchise ment will be as high as it's been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act and there is this stunning silence I represent children a lot of my clients are very young the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13-year-old children to die in prison we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country and we're actually doing some litigation only country in the world I represent people on death row it's interesting this question of the death penalty uh in many ways we've been taught to think that the real question is do people deserve to die for the crimes they've committed and that's a very sensible question but there's another way of thinking about where we are and our identity the other way of thinking about it is not do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit but do we deserve to kill I mean it's fascinating death penalty in America is defined by error for every nine people who have been executed we've actually identified one innocent person who's been exonerated and released from death throw a kind of astonishing a rate one out of nine people innocent I mean it's fascinating and and and in aviation we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem it's not our problem it's not our burden it's not our struggle well I talk a lot about these issues I talk about u a race and this question of whether we deserve to kill and it's interesting when I teach my students about African-American history I tell them about slavery I tell them about terrorism the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II we don't really know very much about it but for African-Americans in this country that was an ERA defined by Terror in many communities people had to worry about being lynched they had to worry about being bombed it was the threat of Terror that shaped their lives and these older people come up to me now and they say Mr Stevenson you give talks you make speeches you tell people to stop saying we're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation's history after 9/11 they tell me to say know tell them that we grew up with that and that era of terrorism was of of course was followed by segregation and Decades of racial subordination and and apartheid then and yet we have in this country this Dynamic where we really don't like to talk about our problems we don't like to talk about our history and because of that we really haven't understood what it's meant to do the things we've done historically and we're constantly running into each other we're constantly creating tensions and conflicts we have a hard time talking about race and I believe it's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa uh people understood that we couldn't overcome our partti without a commitment to Truth and Reconciliation in Rwanda even after the genocide there was this commitment but in this country we haven't done that I was giving this lecture in in Germany some lectures in Germany about the death penalty it was fascinating because one of the uh Scholars stood up after the presentation and said well you know it's deeply troubling to hear what you're talking about I said we don't have the death penalty in Germany and of course we can never have the death penalty in Germany and the room got very quiet and this woman said uh there's no way with our history we can ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings it would be unconscionable for us to in intentional deliberate way set about executing people and I thought about that what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people especially if they were disproportionately Jewish I couldn't bear it it would be unconscionable and yet in this country in the states of the Old South we execute people we are 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched and yet there is this disconnect well I believe that our identity is at risk that when we actually don't care about these difficult things the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated we love Innovation we love technology we love creativity we love entertainment but ultimately those realities are shadowed by suffering abuse degradation marginalization and for me it becomes necessary to integrate the two because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful more committed more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world and for that mean for me that for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor the disadvantaged those who will never get to Ted but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives you know ultimately we all have to believe things we haven't seen we do as rational as we are as committed to intellect as we are Innovation creativity uh development comes not from the ideas and our mind alone they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart and it's that mind heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be tent attentive to all the bright and dazzly things but also the dark and difficult things vak H the great Czech leader talked about this he said uh when we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression we wanted all kinds of things but mostly what we needed was hope and orientation of the spirit a willingness to sometimes be in Hopeless places and be a witness well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even Ted communities have to be engaged in there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering to Poverty to exclusion to unfairness to Injustice now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don't pay attention to this it will get to you I had the great privilege when I was a young lawyer of meeting Rosa Parks and Miss Parks used to come back to mongery every now and then and she would get together with two of her dearest friends these older women Johnny Carr who was the uh organizer of the Montgomery Bus Boycott amazing African-American woman and Virginia dur a white woman whose husband Clipper dur represented Dr King and these women would get together and just talk and every now and then miss Carr would call me and she'd say Brian Miss Parks is Coming to Town we're going get together and talk do you want to come over and listen and I'd say yes ma'am I do and she said well what are you going to do when you get here I said I'm going to listen and I'd go over there and I would I would just listen it would be so energizing and so empowering and one time I was over there listening to these women talk and after a couple of hours Miss Parks turned to me and she said now Brian tell me what the Equal justice initiative is tell me what you're trying to do I began giving her my wrap I said well we're trying to challenge Injustice we're trying to help people who've been wrongly convicted we're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of Criminal Justice we're trying to end life without parole sentences for children we're trying to do something about the death penalty we're trying to reduce the prison population we're trying to end mass incarceration I gave her my whole WAP and when I finished she looked at me and she [Music] said she said that's going to make you tired tired tired and that's when Miss car Lean Forward she put her finger in my face and says that's why you've got to be brave brave brave and I actually believe that the Ted Community needs to be more courageous we need to find ways to to embrace these challenges these problems the suffering because ultimately our Humanity depends on everyone's Humanity I've learned very simple things doing the work that I do it's just taught me very simple things I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done I believe that for every person on the planet I think if somebody tells a lie they're not just a liar I think if somebody takes something that doesn't belong to them they're not just a thief I think even if you kill someone you're not just a killer and because of that there's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of this globe that the opposite of poverty is not wealth I don't believe that I actually think in too many places the opposite of poverty is Justice and finally I believe that despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating we will ultimately not be judged by our technology we won't be judged by our design we won't be judged by our intellect and reason ultimately you judge the character of a society not by how they treat the rich and the powerful and the privileged but by how they treat the poor The Condemned the incarcerated because it's in that Nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are I sometimes get out of balance I'll end with this story I sometimes push too hard I do get tired as we all do sometimes those ideas get ahead of our kind of thinking in ways that are important and I've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to to do these very harsh sentences and I go to the jail and I see my client who's 13 and 14 and he's been certified to stand TR as an adult and I keep start thinking well how did that happen how can a judge turn you into something that you're not and the judge has certified him as an adult but I see this kid and I and I was up too late one night and I started thinking well gosh if the judge can turn you into something that you're not the judge must have magic power I said yeah Brian the judge has some magic power you should ask for some of that and because I was up too late and wasn't thinking real straight I'd started working on a motion and I had a client who was 14 years old a young poor black kid and started working on the this motion with and the head of the motion was a motion to try my poor 14-year-old black male client like a privileged white 75-year-old corporate executive and I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct there was a crazy line in there about how there's no conduct in this County it's all misconduct and at the next morning I woke up and I thought did I dream that crazy motion or did I actually write it into my horror not only had I written it but I had sent it to court couple months uh went by and I just had forgotten all about it and I finally uh decided oh gosh I got to go to the court and do this crazy case and I got in my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed and I got in my car and I went to this Courthouse I was s oh this is going to be so difficult so so painful and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse and as I was walking up the steps of this Courthouse there was an older black man who was the janitor in this Courthouse when this man saw me he came over to me and he said who are you I said I'm a lawyer he saidou a lawyer I said yes sir and this man came over to me and he hugged me and he whispered in my ear he said I'm so proud of you and I have to tell you it was energizing it connected deeply with something in me about identity about the capacity of every person to contribute to community to perspective that is hopeful well I went into the courtroom and as soon as I walked inside the judge saw me coming in he said 'mr Stevenson did you write this crazy motion I saides sir I did and we started arguing people started coming in because they were just outraged i' had written these crazy things and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers before I knew it the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race that we were talking about poverty that we were talking about inequality and out of the corner of my eye I could see this janitor pacing back and forth and he kept looking through the window and he could hear all of this holler and he kept pacing back and forth and finally this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me almost at Council table about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court and this Deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older Blackman he said Jimmy what are you doing in this courtroom this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said I came into this courtroom to tell this young man keep your eyes on the prize hold on I've come to Ted because I believe that many of you understand that the moral Arc of the universe is long but it bends toward Justice that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with a visions of humanity compassion and justce Justice and more than anything for those of you who share that I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize hold on thank you very much Brian um so you heard and saw an obvious Desire by this audience this community to help you on your way and to do something on this issue other than writing a check what what could we do well there are opportunities all around us if you live in the state of California for example there is a referendum coming up this uh spring where actually there's going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment for example here in California we spend we're going to spend $1 billion on the death penalty in the next 5 years $1 billion uh and yet 46% of all homicide cases don't result in arrests uh 56% of all rape cases don't result so there's an opportunity to change that and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to uh law enforcement and and and safety and I think that opportunity exists all around us now there's been this huge decline in crime in in America over the last three decades and part of The Narrative of that is sometimes that it's about increased incarceration rates what would you say to someone who believed that well actually the violent crime rate has has remained relatively stable you know the the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn't really in violent crime categories it was this misguided War on Drugs that's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population a and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle for low-level property crimes rather than making them give those resources back back to the people who they victimized I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime not do less and I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one and I think that's the orientation that we have to change Brian you've you've struck a massive cord here you're an inspiring person thank you so much for coming to T thank you

We are not beasts and we do not intend \nto be beaten or driven as such... What has happened here \nis but the sound before the fury of those who are oppressed.” These words were spoken during \nthe 1971 Attica Prison Rebellion by one of its leaders, Elliott Barkley. At the time, Attica prison\nwas severely overcrowded. Its majority Black and Latino population\nfaced constant physical and verbal abuse. All prison guards were white. Some were members \nof white supremacist hate groups. Guards threw away letters \nthat weren’t written in English and prohibited Muslim religious services. They punished white prisoners \nfor fraternizing with non-white men. Prisoners were allowed one shower a week\nand one roll of toilet paper a month. Among those imprisoned at Attica were \nElliott Barkley, Frank Smith, and Herbert X. Blyden. “I’m dying here little by little \nevery day...” Barkley wrote his mother. She contacted authorities, \nbut nothing changed. He began writing a book\nabout life at Attica. Meanwhile, Smith worked a position \ncalled the “warden’s laundry boy” for 30 cents day. His grandmother had been enslaved. Because Smith and others were treated \nas less-than-human at the will of their keepers, they viewed \nprison as an extension of slavery. And Blyden had participated \nin prison strikes and rebellions. He and others saw the violence of prison\nas symptomatic of a societal problem where individuals are denied justice\nbased on their class and race. They felt people shouldn’t be stripped\nof their rights to health and dignity upon being sentenced. Instead, resources should go towards\nmeeting people’s basic needs to prevent crime in the first place. In the summer of 1971, Blyden co-founded \nthe Attica Liberation Faction. The group compiled a manifesto and petitioned \nCorrections Commissioner Russell Oswald and Governor Nelson Rockefeller\nfor better treatment. Though largely ignored, \nthey continued organizing. After activist George Jackson was killed \nat a California prison, 700 men at Attica participated \nin a silent fast. Just weeks later, on September 9th,\na spontaneous uprising began. A group of prisoners overpowered guards,\nsparking the Attica Rebellion. Prisoners broke windows, started fires,\nand captured supplies. They beat many guards. One of them, William Quinn,\nwould die from his injuries. Soon, over 1,200 prisoners had \nassembled in the yard with 42 hostages, preparing to demand change. They established a medical bay, \ndelegated men to prepare and ration food, protected and sheltered guards, \nand elected a negotiating committee. They appointed Blyden chief negotiator,\nSmith as security chief, and Barkely as a speaker. Later that day, Barkley presented \ntheir demands to the press. When his mother saw him on TV, \nshe was terrified. He was just days from being released. But she believed authorities \nwould want retribution. Over the next four days, prisoners\nheld negotiations with officials. They called for a minimum wage,\nrehabilitation programs, better education, and more. They promised all remaining hostages \nwould be safe if they were given amnesty \nfor crimes committed during the uprising. Meanwhile, Governor Rockefeller began\ncrisis talks with President Nixon. The president told his chief of staff\nthat the rebellion should be quelled to set an example \nfor other Black activists. Commissioner Oswald announced he’d\nmeet a number of the demands, but refused to guarantee amnesty. Prisoners refused to surrender. As warnings of an imminent siege mounted, they threatened to kill 8 hostages \nif attacked. Nevertheless, Rockefeller ordered\ntroops to retake the prison. Helicopters tear-gassed the yard. Troopers shot over 2,000 rounds \nof ammunition, killing 29 prisoners and 10 guards, \nand wounding many others. Witnesses say troopers found Barkley \nand shot him in the back. Officers stripped surviving men naked, \ntortured them, and deprived them of medical attention. Blyden was starved for days. Smith was sexually violated, \nburned with cigarettes, dragged into isolation, and beaten. Directly after the attack, \nGovernor Rockefeller thought prisoners were responsible for the deaths \nof the 10 guards. He called it\n“a beautiful operation.” President Nixon congratulated Rockefeller\nand told his chief of staff that the way to stop “radicals” \nwas to “kill a few.” But autopsies soon confirmed \nthat prisoners hadn’t killed any guards during \nthe attack, as threatened. Government forces had. Nixon told Rockefeller \nto stand his ground. Those who survived the massacre continued \nfighting for revolutionary change. Long after being released, Smith and Blyden campaigned \nfor social justice and prison abolition. The demands men made at Attica in 1971 remain at the core of ongoing protests—\nwithin and beyond prison walls."}, "multiple-choice": []}

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-we-must-confront-hard-historical-truths-hasan-kwame-jeffries", "transcript": {"en": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] not that long ago I received an invitation to spend a few days at the historic home of James Madison James Madison of course was the fourth President of the United States the father of the Constitution the architect of the Bill of Rights and as a historian I was really excited to go to this Historic Site because I understand and appreciate the power of place now Madison called his estate Montpelier and Montpelier is absolutely beautiful it's several thousand acres of rolling hills farmland and forests with absolutely breathtaking views of the Blue Ridge Mountains but it's a haunting beauty because Montpelier was also a slave labor camp you see James Madison enslaved more than 100 people over the course of his lifetime and he never freed a single soul not even upon his death the centerpiece of Montpelier is Madison's mansion now this is where James Madison grew up this is where he returned to after his presidency this is where he eventually died and the centerpiece of Madison's mansion is his library this room on the second floor where Madison conceived and conceptualized the Bill of Rights when I visited for the first time the director of Education Christian Coates who I do took me almost immediately to the library and it was amazing being able to stand in this place where such an important moment in American history happened but then after a little while there Christian actually took me downstairs to the cellars of the mansion now in the cellars of the mansion that's where the enslaved african-americans who managed the house spent most of their time it's also where they were installing a new exhibition on slavery in America and while we were there Christian instructed me to do something I thought was a little bit strange he told me to take my hand and place it on the brick walls of the cellar and to slide it along until I felt these impressions or ridges in the face of the brick now look I was gonna be staying on site on this former slave plantation for a couple days so I wasn't trying to upset any white people because when this was over I wanted to make sure that I could get out but as I'm actually sliding my hand along the cellar wall I couldn't help but think about my daughter's and my youngest one in particular who was only about 2 or 3 years old at the time because every time she hopped out of our car she would take her hand and slide it along the outside which is absolutely disgusting and then and then if I couldn't get to her in time she would take her fingers and pop them in the mouth which would drive me absolutely crazy so this is what I'm thinking about what I'm supposed to be a historian but then but then I actually do feel these impressions in the brick I feel these ridges in the brick and it takes a second to realize what they are what they are are tiny handprints because all of the bricks at James Madison's estate were made by the children that he enslaved and that's when it hit me that the library in which James Madison conceives and conceptualizes the Bill of Rights rests on a foundation of bricks made by the children that he enslaved and this is hard history it's hard history because it's difficult to imagine the kind of inhumanity that leads one to enslave children to make bricks for your comfort and convenience it's hard history because it's hard to talk about the violence of slavery the beatings the whippings the kidnappings the forced family separations it's hard history because it's hard to teach white supremacy which is the ideology that justified slavery and so rather than confront hard history we tend to avoid it now sometimes that means just making stuff up I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say that states rights was the primary cause of the civil war that would actually come as a surprise to the people who fought in the Civil War sometimes we try to rationalize hard history when people visit Montpelier and by people in this instance I mean white people when they visit Montpelier and learn about Madison enslaving people they often ask but wasn't he a good master a good master there is no such thing as a good master there is only worse and worse ER and sometimes we just pretend the past didn't happen I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say it's hard to imagine slavery existing outside of the plantation South no taint slavery existed in every American colony slavery existed in my home state of New York for 50 years after the American Revolution so why do we do this why do we avoid confronting hard history literary performer and educator Reggie Gibson had the truth of it when he said that our problem as Americans is we actually hate history what we love is nostalgia nostalgia we love stories about the past that make us feel comfortable about the present but we can't keep doing this George Santayana the Spanish writer and philosopher said that those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it now as a historian I spend a lot of time thinking about this very statement and in a sense it applies to us in America but in a way it doesn't because inherent in this statement is the notion that at some point we stop doing the things that have created inequality in the first place and the harsh reality is we have it consider the racial wealth gap wealth is generated by accumulating resources in one generation and transferring them to subsequent generations median white household wealth is $147,000 median black household wealth is $4,000 how do you explain this growing gap hard history my great-great-grandfather was born enslaved in Jasper County Georgia in the 1850s while enslaved he was never allowed to accumulate anything and he was emancipated with nothing he was never compensated for the bricks that he made my great-grandfather was also born in Jasper County Georgia in the 1870s and he actually managed to accumulate a fair bit of land but in the 19-teens Jim Crow took that land from him and then Jim Crow took his life my grandfather Leonard Jeffries senior was born in Georgia but there was nothing left for him there so he actually grew up in Newark New Jersey and he spent most of his life working as a custodian job discrimination segregated education and redlining kept him from ever breaking into the middle class and so when he passed away in the early 1990s he left to his two sons nothing more than a life-insurance policy that was barely enough to cover his funeral expenses now my parents both social workers they actually managed to purchase a home in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn New York in 1980 for $55,000 now Crown Heights at the time was an all-black neighborhood and it was kind of rough my brother and I often went to sleep by the mid-1980s hearing gunshots but my parents protected us and my parents also held on to that home for 40 years and they're still there but something quintessentially American happened about 20 years ago about 20 years ago they went to sleep one night in an all-black neighborhood and they woke up the next morning in an all-white neighborhood and as a result of gentrification not only did all their neighbors mysteriously disappear but the value of their home skyrocketed so that home that they purchased for $55,000 at 29% interest by the way that home is now worth 30 times what they paid it for 30 times do the math with me that's 55,000 times 30 carry two zeros that's a lot of money so that means as their single in sole asset when the time comes with them to pass that asset on to my brother and I that will be the first time in my family's history more than a hundred and fifty years after the end of slavery that there will be a meaningful transfer of wealth in my family and it's not because family members haven't saved having worked hard haven't valued education it's because of hard history so when I think about the past my concern about not remembering it is not that we will repeat it if we don't remember it my concern my fear is that if we don't remember the past we will continue it we will continue to do the things that created inequality and injustice in the first place so what we must do is we must disrupt the continuum of hard history and we can do this by seeking truth by confronting hard history directly by magnifying hard history for all the world to see we can do this by speaking truth teachers teaching hard history to their students to do anything else is to commit educational malpractice and parents have to speak truth to their children so that they understand where we have come from as a nation and finally we must all act on truth individually and collectively publicly and privately in small ways and in large ways we must do the things that will bend the arc of the moral universe towards justice to do nothing is to be complicit in inequality history reminds us that we as a nation stand on the shoulders of political Giants like James Madison but hard history reminds us that we as a nation also stand on the shoulders of enslaved African American children little black boys and little black girls who with their bare hands made the bricks that serve as the foundation for this nation and if we are serious about creating a fair and just society then we would do well to remember that and we would do well to remember them thank you [Applause]"}, "multiple-choice": []}

They all know he’s full of tales \nfrom Ghana, the land of their ancestors. But what they don’t know, Kwaku winks, is how their ancestors got those stories\nin the first place. Long ago, all stories belonged to Nyame,\nthe all-seeing Sky God. People on Earth were bored \nand knew nothing about their history. But one creature decided\nenough was enough. Anansi, the tricky, shapeshifting spider, resolved to bring the stories\ndown to Earth. He spun a web that stretched \ninto the clouds and climbed up to confront the Sky God. Crouching at Nyame’s feet,\nAnansi shouted at the top of his lungs that he had come to take ownership \nof the world’s stories. Looking down from his golden stool, Nyame hooted with laughter \nat the spider’s absurd request. Nyame told Anansi that he could have\nall the stories he wished— but only if he could complete\nan impossible task. If Anansi brought him \nOsebo the Leopard, Onini the Python, Mmoboro the Hornet, \nand Mmoatia the Forest Spirit, then he could take the stories. Anansi humbly accepted. Nyame didn’t see him grinning \nas he scuttled away. Back on Earth, Anansi grabbed \nhis magic bag and set to work. Anansi found Onini the Python\nbathing in the sun. Anansi scoffed that Onini \ncouldn’t be the longest animal, saying he looked no longer \nthan a piece of bamboo cane. Enraged, Onini stretched himself across\nthe bamboo to prove his lengthiness. Anansi quickly bound him tight-tight \nto each end and placed him in his bag. Next, Anansi dug a great pit \nin the middle of the path Osebo the Leopard usually prowled,\nand covered it with banana leaves. Sure enough, mighty Osebo soon fell in. Anansi scolded Osebo for his carelessness,\nbut offered to rescue him. As he helped Osebo out of the pit,\nAnansi swiftly jabbed him with his knife. Osebo fell back to the ground where Anansi wound him up\ntight-tight in spider thread. Then, Anansi heard Mmoboro \nand his hornets buzzing. He cautiously approached them. This would be tricky— their stings \ncould make someone swell up and die— but Anansi knew they hated rain. He filled his mouth with water \nand spat it at the swarm. As they panicked, Anansi urged the hornets\nto shelter in his gourd, where they found themselves trapped. Anansi had one more task:\nto capture Mmoatia the elusive and mischievous Forest Spirit. She usually hid herself deep in the woods,\nbut Anansi knew she was lonely. So, he made a little doll covered in sap\nand left it in her path. When she came upon it, \nMmoatia spoke to the doll but became enraged when it didn’t answer. She hit the disrespectful doll and her small fists stuck \nto its sticky surface. Anansi wrapped Mmoatia up tight-tight \nand scooped her into his bag along with the other creatures. Triumphantly, he climbed his web\nback into the clouds. When the Sky God saw that Anansi \nhad completed the impossible task, he was amazed. Nyame told Anansi \nthat he had earned the world’s stories. Dancing for joy, Anansi gathered them up,\nstuffed the stories into his bag, and descended to Earth. There, he scattered the stories \nthroughout the world for people to share. And they did, Kwaku tells the children. Generations have continued\ntelling and reimagining Anansi’s stories even after being stolen from Africa\nand enslaved. Anansi may be small, but “cunning’s\nbetter than strong,” Kwaku says, and tells the children to take Anansi’s \nstories with them wherever they go. Looking at his audience, Kwaku knows\nthat Anansi will persist as a symbol of resourcefulness \nand resistance in the face of oppression, and a testament to the enduring power\nof storytelling."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where did the Anansi stories originate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "From Europe "}, {"label": "B", "text": "From the Caribbean"}, {"label": "C", "text": "From Asia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "From America "}, {"label": "E", "text": "From Ghana (West Africa)"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "How did they end up being told in the Caribbean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They were brought to the Caribbean by Europeans"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They were brought to the Caribbean by enslaved people"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They were brought to the Caribbean by Christopher Columbus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They have always been told in the Caribbean  "}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What did Anansi want from the Sky-God Nyame?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A magic bag"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The be the most powerful spider in the world"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To find the cure for diseases "}, {"label": "D", "text": "To bring stories down to earth for everybody to enjoy "}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How did Anansi catch Mmoatia, the elusive and mischievous Forest Spirit?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By trapping her in his magic bag"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By trapping her in a gourd"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By tricking her into getting stuck on a sap-covered doll "}, {"label": "D", "text": "By tricking her into being eaten by the Sky-God"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does the Jamaican saying ‘cunning better than strong’ mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All cunning people are strong "}, {"label": "B", "text": "All strong people are cunning"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All strong people should avoid cunning people "}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is better to be cunning than it is to be strong"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 80, "lesson": 20, "title": "Learn to read Chinese ... with ease!", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/wJgVq9sO", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Joseph Geni\nReviewer: Morton Bast Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters. Ever since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language. But to an outsider, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China. Over the past few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so. I started thinking about how a new, fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years. Since we only have five minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simpler way. A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters. You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy. The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs, restaurant menus, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers. Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. You are ready? Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square. You get a mouth. This is a person going for a walk. Person. If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, \"Help! I'm on fire!\" -- This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame, but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you. This is a tree. Tree. This is a mountain. The sun. The moon. The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. I call these eight characters radicals. They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters. A person. If someone walks behind, that is \"to follow.\" As the old saying goes, two is company, three is a crowd. If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, \"It was this big.\" The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped. He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale. One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods. Three trees together, we create the forest. Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation. Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's \"idiot.\" (Laughter) Easy to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. Remember fire? Two fires together, I get really hot. Three fires together, that's a lot of flames. Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning. For us, the sun is the source of prosperity. Two suns together, prosperous. Three together, that's sparkles. Put the sun and the moon shining together, it's brightness. It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night. The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise. A door. Put a plank inside the door, it's a door bolt. Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions. Knock knock. Is anyone home? This person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading. On the left, we have a woman. Two women together, they have an argument. (Laughter) Three women together, be careful, it's adultery. So we have gone through almost 30 characters. By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32. The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32. So with very little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old. So after we know the characters, we start building phrases. For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain. It's a volcano. We know Japan is the land of the rising sun. This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan lies to the east of China. So a sun, origin together, we build Japan. A person behind Japan, what do we get? A Japanese person. The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other. In ancient China, that means in exile, because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains. Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out. A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The first eight radicals will allow you to build how many characters?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "16"}, {"label": "B", "text": "32"}, {"label": "C", "text": "64"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 80, "lesson": 21, "title": "How stretching actually changes your muscles - Malachy McHugh", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-stretching-actually-changes-your-muscles-malachy-mchugh", "transcript": {"en": "Here we have an athlete\npreparing for a game. They’ve put on their gear\nand done their warmup, and now it’s time for one\nmore routine— stretching. Typically, athletes stretch before\nphysical activity to avoid injuries like muscle strains and tears. But does stretching actually prevent\nthese issues? And if so, how long do the benefits\nof stretching last? To answer these questions, we need to know what's actually happening\nin the body when we stretch. There are two kinds of stretching\nour athlete might be doing. Dynamic stretches,\nwhich are controlled movements that engage a range of muscles\nthroughout the motion. And static stretches, \nwhere the stretcher holds a position to keep specific muscles\nat a fixed length and tension. Our athlete is currently doing\na static hamstring stretch— a 30 second interval \nwhere he pulls his hamstring beyond its usual range of motion. However, while we often think \nof stretching a muscle like stretching a rubber band, muscles are actually comprised\nof various tissue types, which interact to make a complex material. Rubber is elastic, meaning \nit resists being stretched and then returns to its original shape. But muscle is viscoelastic. This means that, in addition\nto those elastic qualities, muscle changes under the stress\nof being stretched. Let’s see this in action. At the large scale, this hamstring stretch\nis pulling on layers of protective tissue surrounding the muscle fibers, as well as the tendons that connect\nthis muscle to nearby bones. These tissues contain elastic proteins\nlike collagen and elastin, which allow them to slightly elongate\nover the duration of the stretch. At the smaller scale, these skeletal\nmuscle fibers are comprised of millions of sarcomeres— the smallest contracting unit\nof muscle tissue. Sarcomere’s long, fibrous proteins can\nrelax to elongate muscle fibers or they can contract to shorten them— pulling on tendons and protective tissue to create the force\npropelling our athlete’s body. And when those tissues have\nbeen stretched out, they retain their strength\nat longer lengths, allowing our athlete to take full\nadvantage of his improved range of motion. Unlike a rubber band, this muscle’s\nresistance to stretching decreases with each 30 second stretch, allowing our athlete\nto continually elongate his hamstring. And this improved flexibility\nlikely decreases the chance of incurring certain muscle injuries. But due to muscle’s elastic properties, this effect will be gone in just \n10 minutes without further activity. The exercise from his match should\nelevate his muscle’s temperature and continue elongating the muscle, maintaining his increased flexibility\nthroughout the game. But once he gives his hamstrings a break, they’ll retract back \nto their previous state. So if all this is just temporary, how can you permanently improve \nyour flexibility? For skeletal muscles, improved flexibility\ncomes from additional sarcomeres, which allow you to maintain strength\nat even greater lengths. Sarcomeres are added and subtracted\nto muscles depending on how frequently they’re used, so improving overall flexibility requires\na comprehensive stretching regimen. Plus, you need to stretch often—\nvery often. Current research suggests at least \n10 minutes a day for roughly two months. And since it's unsafe to hold\nany stretch for too long, it's recommended that you break up your\nstretching within any given session. Frequent stretching also makes lasting\nchanges to your brain. The more you stretch a muscle,\nthe higher your pain threshold becomes, allowing you to stretch\nfurther and further. Long-term improvements \nto your flexibility can provide a better range of motion for your joints, potentially reducing your risk of muscle\ninjury in the short and long-term. But it’s also possible\nto stretch too much, as flexible people can move their joints\nin potentially dangerous ways. Stretching also isn't helpful\nfor every kind of movement, especially those where muscle\ninjuries aren't very common. For example, long distance running only\ninvolves a small range of motion for the joints involved, so stretching is unlikely to prevent\nthat sport’s most common injuries. When it comes down to it, different lifestyles require \ndifferent kinds of mobility. And no single stretching regimen is\nflexible enough to fit every situation."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following statements accurately describes what happens when we stretch our muscles?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Muscle is elastic and will act like a rubber band when it is stretched."}, {"label": "B", "text": "If we stretch our muscles several times the resistance to stretch will decrease and the next day your muscles will be more flexible (less stiff)."}, {"label": "C", "text": "When we stretch repeatedly over a few days we can achieve a greater range of motion because we can better tolerate the discomfort of the stretch."}, {"label": "D", "text": "30 second hamstring stretches will be sufficient to decrease resistance to stretch and this effect will last at least an hour."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements is false?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When a muscle is stretched it displays a combination of elastic and viscous effects and this is referred to as viscoelastic behavior."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Marathon runners need to stretch a lot to have adequate flexibility to run and avoid injury.

{"page": 80, "lesson": 22, "title": "How to read music - Tim Hansen", "category": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-read-music-tim-hansen", "transcript": {"en": "When we watch a film or a play, we know that the actors probably learned\ntheir lines from a script, which essentially tells them\nwhat to say and when to say it. A piece of written music\noperates on exactly the same principle. In a very basic sense, it tells a performer what to play\nand when to play it. Aesthetically speaking,\nthere's a world of difference between, say, Beethoven and Justin Bieber, but both artists have used the same building blocks\nto create their music: notes. And although the end result\ncan sound quite complicated, the logic behind musical notes\nis actually pretty straightforward. Let's take a look at the foundational\nelements to music notation and how they interact\nto create a work of art. Music is written on five parallel lines\nthat go across the page. These five lines are called a staff, and a staff operates on two axes: up and down and left to right. The up-and-down axis tells the performer the pitch of the note\nor what note to play, and the left-to-right axis tells the performer the rhythm of the note or when to play it. Let's start with pitch. To help us out,\nwe're going to use a piano, but this system works for pretty much\nany instrument you can think of. In the Western music tradition, pitches are named after\nthe first seven letters of the alphabet, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. After that, the cycle repeats itself: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and so on. But how do these pitches get their names? Well, for example, if you played an F and then played another F higher or lower on the piano, you'd notice that they sound\npretty similar compared to, say, a B. Going back to the staff, every line and every space\nbetween two lines represents a separate pitch. If we put a note on one of these lines\nor one of these spaces, we're telling a performer\nto play that pitch. The higher up on the staff\na note is placed, the higher the pitch. But there are obviously\nmany, many more pitches than the nine that these\nlines and spaces gives us. A grand piano, for example, can play 88 separate notes. So how do we condense\n88 notes onto a single staff? We use something called a clef, a weird-looking figure\nplaced at the beginning of the staff, which acts like a reference point, telling you that a particular\nline or space corresponds to a specific note\non your instrument. If we want to play notes\nthat aren't on the staff, we kind of cheat and draw\nextra little lines called ledger lines and place the notes on them. If we have to draw so many ledger lines\nthat it gets confusing, then we need to change\nto a different clef. As for telling a performer\nwhen to play the notes, two main elements control this: the beat and the rhythm. The beat of a piece of music is, by itself, kind of boring. It sounds like this. (Ticking) Notice that it doesn't change, it just plugs along quite happily. It can go slow or fast or whatever you like, really. The point is that just\nlike the second hand on a clock divides one minute into sixty seconds, with each second just as long\nas every other second, the beat divides a piece of music into little fragments of time\nthat are all the same length: beats. With a steady beat as a foundation, we can add rhythm to our pitches, and that's when music\nreally starts to happen. This is a quarter note. It's the most basic unit of rhythm, and it's worth one beat. This is a half note,\nand it's worth two beats. This whole note here is worth four beats, and these little guys are eighth notes, worth half a beat each. \"Great,\" you say, \"what does that mean?\" You might have noticed\nthat across the length of a staff, there are little lines dividing it\ninto small sections. These are bar lines and we refer to each section as a bar. At the beginning of a piece of music, just after the clef, is something called the time signature, which tells a performer\nhow many beats are in each bar. This says there are two beats in each bar, this says there are three, this one four, and so on. The bottom number tells\nus what kind of note is to be used as the basic\nunit for the beat. One corresponds to a whole note, two to a half note, four to a quarter note, and eight to an eighth note, and so on. So this time signature here tells us that there are four\nquarter notes in each bar, one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four, and so on. But like I said before, if we just stick to the beat, it gets kind of boring, so we'll replace some quarter notes\nwith different rhythms. Notice that even though\nthe number of notes in each bar has changed, the total number of beats\nin each bar hasn't. So, what does our musical\ncreation sound like? (Music) Eh, sounds okay, but maybe\na bit thin, right? Let's add another instrument\nwith its own pitch and rhythm. Now it's sounding like music. Sure, it takes some practice\nto get used to reading it quickly and playing what we see on our instrument, but, with a bit of time and patience, you could be the next Beethoven or Justin Bieber."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The left/right axis on a staff tells a performer:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the rhythm"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the beat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the pitch"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the clef"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In music, the letters A to G describe:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the rhythm"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the beat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the pitch"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the clef"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "To add notes to a staff that don’t fall within the given lines and spaces, we add extra little lines called _____ lines.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "linear"}, {"label": "B", "text": "legato"}, {"label": "C", "text": "ledger"}, {"label": "D", "text": "learning"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A quarter note is worth:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "one beat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "two beats"}, {"label": "C", "text": "four beats"}, {"label": "D", "text": "half a beat"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which time signature tells a performer that there are four half-note beats in each bar?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2/4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4/2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2/2"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4/4"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

So for example, we scroll\nthrough social media \"for fun,\" even though doing so often makes us feel\nbad about, like, kind of everything. Or we'll say, \"That was so fun.\nWe should do that again soon\" -- (Laughter) ... in response to things\nthat weren't that fun and that we don't want to do again, ever. (Laughter) But it's not really our fault\nthat we're a little bit sloppy about how we use the word \"fun,\" because even the dictionary\ndoesn't get it quite right. It says that fun\nis amusement or enjoyment, or lighthearted pleasure. It's something for kids\nto have in play areas. It makes it sound\nlike it's frivolous and optional. But if you think back on your own memories that stand out to you\nas having truly been fun -- and I really encourage you to do this -- the memories that you would describe as -- and forgive me\nfor scientific terminology -- \"so fun\" -- you're going to notice\nthere's something much deeper going on. I've collected thousands of these stories\nfrom people all around the world, and I can tell you it's amazing, because when people recount the memories\nin which they had the most fun, they tell you about some\nof the most joyful and treasured memories of their lives. So in reality, fun is not\njust lighthearted pleasure. It's not just for kids, and it is definitely not frivolous. Instead, fun is the secret\nto feeling alive. So today, I want to propose to you a new, more precise definition\nof what fun is. I want to reveal some of the ways\nin which it is astonishingly good for us, and I want to give you all\nsome suggestions for things you can do starting right now\nto experience its power for yourself. So the first thing we need to start with is the fact that fun is a feeling,\nand it's not an activity. And that's important, because a lot of times,\nwhen I ask people what's fun, they'll respond with a list\nof activities that they enjoy. You know, they'll say, \"Dancing is fun,\"\nor \"Skiing is fun,\" or, I don't know, \"Pickleball is fun.\" Everyone seems to think\nthat pickleball is fun. (Cheers and laughter) And sure, pickleball can be fun, but we've all had experiences\nwhere something's off, and an activity that seems\nlike it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun. And then on the flip side, we've had experiences where something\nthat doesn't seem like it'll be fun at all ends up feeling ridiculously fun. There's an element of serendipity. But when people do have fun, when they experience this feeling, it's actually very easy to recognize, because people who are having fun look like they're being\nilluminated from within. So, for example, here is me and my husband\nhaving fun together. Here are some presidents\nhaving fun together. (Laughter) Here’s Archbishop Desmond Tutu\nand the Dalai Lama having fun together. (Cheers and laughter) Actually, those two seemed like\nthey were very often, even constantly ... (Laughter) ... having fun together. (Laughter) And as you can see in these photographs, true fun produces this visceral sense\nof lightness and joy. It's radiant. In fact, when I asked my daughter,\nwhen she was about five years old, what color fun would be, she said \"sunshine.\" So what is this sunshine? You know? What is this feeling\nthat we call \"fun\"? When people tell me\ntheir stories about fun, it's really interesting,\nbecause the details are all different, and often quite mundane, but the energy running\nthrough them is the same. There were three factors\nthat are consistently present, to the point that I believe\nthey constitute a new definition, one that is a lot more accurate\nthan what's in the dictionary. And those three factors\nare playfulness, connection and flow. So by playfulness, I do not mean you have to play games, or, God forbid, make believe. I just mean having a lighthearted attitude of doing things\nfor the sake of doing them and not caring too much about the outcome. Letting go of perfectionism. When we have fun, our guard is down, and we're not taking ourselves\ntoo seriously. Connection refers to the feeling of having\na special, shared experience. And I do think it's possible,\nin some circumstances, to have fun alone, and for this feeling of connection\nto be with yourself or the surroundings, or the activity. But in the majority of stories\nthat people tell me about their peak fun memories, another person is involved. And that's true even for introverts. And then flow is the state\nwhere we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time. You can think about an athlete\nin the middle of a game, or a musician playing a piece of music. It's when we're in the zone. It's possible to be in flow\nand not have fun, like if you're arguing, but you cannot have fun\nif you're not in flow. So playfulness, connection and flow\nall feel great on their own. But when we experience all three at once, something magical happens. We have fun. And that doesn't just feel good, it is good for us. In fact, fun does so many\namazingly good things for us that I personally believe that fun is not\njust the result of human thriving, it's a cause. So, for example, fun is energizing. When people tell me their stories\nabout fun, they glow. It is like a fire has been lit\ninside of them, and the energy and the warmth\nthat they give off is contagious. You know, so much of life drains us, but fun fills us up. Fun also makes us present. A lot of us put a lot of work\ninto trying to be more present -- we do yoga classes, we meditate,\nand that is all great, but the fact that fun is a flow state\nmeans that when we are having fun, we simply are present. There's no other way for it to happen. Fun also unites us. We live in a really polarized world, and as we all know,\nthere's a lot of very serious problems. But when we have fun with people, we don't see them\nas different political parties, or nationalities or religions. We connect with them as human beings, and it's worth noting\nthat that is the first step in being able to work together\nto solve those problems. Fun also makes us healthier. Being lonely and stressed out, as many of us have been\nfor the past two years, causes hormonal changes in our bodies\nthat increase our risks for disease. But when we have fun, we're relaxed and we're more\nsocially connected, both of which have the opposite effect. So, kind of blows my mind every time\nI think about it this way, but having fun is a health intervention. And then, lastly, fun is joyful. You know, we all so desperately\nwant to be happy. We read books about happiness, we download apps about happiness, but when we are in a moment\nof having fun, we are happy. So it makes me think that, perhaps, the secret to long-term happiness is just to have more\neveryday moments of fun. So how do we do that? How do we have more fun? Well, to start with, do not take the suggestions\nyou'll find in magazine articles about how to have more fun. I looked at some of these myself, and I found suggestions that include --\nand I'm not making these up -- \"roast a turkey.\" (Laughter) \"Put together an altar\nto loved ones who have passed.\" (Laughter) “Watch a documentary\nabout climate change.” (Laughter) And my personal favorite, \"Adorn your table with gourds.\" (Laughter) Those are not good suggestions. Instead, the most effective thing\nyou can do to have more fun is to focus on its ingredients,\nby which I mean, do everything you can to fill your life\nwith more moments of playfulness, connection and flow. So here are some ideas for how to do so. To start with, reduce distractions\nin order to increase flow. Anything that distracts you\nis going to kick you out of flow and prevent you from having fun. And what's the number one\nsource of distraction for most of us, these days? Oh, thank you. (Laughs) It was rhetorical, but yes, your phones. (Laughs) I wrote a book called\n\"How to Break Up With Your Phone,\" so I have strong feelings about this, but I can guarantee you\nthat you are not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone. So today, I want to challenge you\nto keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible, so you can take me up\non my second suggestion, which is to increase connection by interacting more\nwith other human beings in real life. Now, I know that one of the main reasons\nwe're constantly on our phones is specifically to avoid\nhaving to spend time and interact with other\nhuman beings in real life. (Laughter) So I want to assure you\nthat it is worth it, and it is not as hard as it might seem. So here's how you do it. You start by making\neye contact with someone. Like, look them in the eye, don't look in the middle\nof their forehead, where the camera would be on a Zoom call. (Laughter) And you say “Hello.” And if that goes well,\nyou can introduce yourself. And if that goes well, maybe you can ask them a question,\nsomething that's thought-provoking, but not overly personal or threatening, like \"What's something\nthat fascinates you?\" Or \"What's one thing\nthat delighted you today?\" And you might be amazed by how good\njust one little moment of connection can make you feel. And if you do find someone\nto connect with, maybe ask them to join you\nin trying my third suggestion, which is to increase playfulness\nby finding opportunities to rebel. Now I am not talking about\nJames Dean-level of rebellion. I'm talking about playful deviance. I'm talking about finding ways\nto break the rules of responsible adulthood, and giving yourself permission\nto get a kick out of your own life. One person told me that some of the most fun\nshe'd had in recent memory, happened on a Friday morning, when she and some of her friends\nditched their work and their childcare responsibilities, tucked flasks into their purses and snuck out to a 10:30am showing\nof the movie \"Bad Moms.\" (Laughter) So lastly, here's one more thing\nthat you can do today to start having more fun. [Roast a Turkey]\nI am just kidding. (Laughter) Prioritize it. That might sound totally obvious, but one of the main reasons\nwe're not having enough fun is that we're not making it a priority. Our fun is always\nat the bottom of the list, and it can't speak up for itself. So I'm not suggesting that you take out\nyour calendar and make an entry that says: “From 4 to 6pm\non Saturday, I shall have fun.” That is a guaranteed way to not have fun. But if you know you consistently have fun when you spend time\nwith a particular person, make a point to spend time\nwith that person. If you know there's an activity that really does often generate\nplayful connected flow for you, carve out time for it in your schedule. Treat fun as if it is important. Because it is. I've been doing this myself\nfor a couple of years now, and it's amazing to see how many areas\nof my life fun has touched. I'm more creative and more productive,\nI'm more resilient. I laugh more. Making sure that I'm having enough fun\nhas made me a better partner, a better parent and a better friend. And it has convinced me of something that I very much hope\nI can convince you of as well, which is that my daughter was right. Fun is sunshine. It's a distillation of life's energy. And the more often we experience it, the more we will feel\nlike we're actually alive. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 80, "lesson": 24, "title": "How to spot a fad diet - Mia Nacamulli", "category": "Nutrition", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/do-fad-diets-work-mia-nacamulli", "transcript": {"en": "Conventional wisdom about diets, including government \nhealth recommendations, seems to change all the time. And yet, ads routinely come about claiming to have the answer \nabout what we should eat. So how do we distinguish \nwhat's actually healthy from what advertisers just want us\nto believe is good for us? Marketing takes advantage of\nthe desire to drop weight fast, and be stronger, slimmer, and brighter. And in the big picture, diet plans\npromising dramatic results, known as fad diets, are just what they seem:\ntoo good to be true. So where do diet fads even come from? While the Ancient Greeks and Romans rallied behind large-scale \nhealth regimens centuries earlier, this phenomenon began in earnest\nin the Victorian Era with crazes like the vinegar diet and the Banting Diet. Since then, diets have advised us \nall sorts of things: to excessively chew, to not chew at all, to swallow a grapefruit per meal, non-stop cabbage soup, even consumption of arsenic, or tapeworms. If the idea of diet crazes \nhas withstood history, could this mean that they work? In the short term, \nthe answer is often yes. Low-carbohydrate plans, like the popular Atkins \nor South Beach Diets, have an initial diuretic effect. Sodium is lost until the body\ncan balance itself out, and temporary fluid weight loss may occur. With other high-protein diets,\nyou might lose weight at first since by restricting your food choices, you are dropping \nyour overall calorie intake. But your body then lowers \nits metabolic rate to adjust to the shift, lessening the diet's effect over time and resulting in a quick reversal\nif the diet is abandoned. So while these diets \nmay be alluring early on, they don't guarantee long-term benefits\nfor your health and weight. A few simple guidelines, though,\ncan help differentiate between a diet that is beneficial \nin maintaining long-term health, and one that only offers temporary\nweight changes. Here's the first tipoff: If a diet focuses on intensely cutting\nback calories or on cutting out entire food groups, like fat, sugar, or carbohydrates, chances are it's a fad diet. And another red flag is ritual, when the diet in question instructs you\nto only eat specific foods, prescribed combinations, or to opt for particular food substitutes, like drinks, bars, or powders. The truth is shedding pounds\nin the long run simply doesn't have a quick-fix solution. Not all diet crazes tout weight loss. What about claims of superfoods, cleanses,\nand other body-boosting solutions? Marketing emphasizes the allure of products associated with ancient \nand remote cultures to create a sense of mysticism\nfor consumers. While so-called superfoods,\nlike blueberries or açaí, do add a powerful punch of nutrients, their super transformative qualities\nare largely exaggeration. They are healthy additions \nto a balanced diet, yet often, they're marketed\nas part of sugary drinks or cereals, in which case the negative properties\noutweight the benefits. Cleanses, too, may be great in moderation since they can assist \nwith jumpstarting weight loss and can increase the number of fresh\nfruits and vegetables consumed daily. Scientifically speaking, though, they've not yet been shown to have\neither a long-term benefit or to detox the body any better than\nthe natural mechanisms already in place. Everywhere we look, we're offered solutions \nto how we can look better, feel fitter, and generally get ahead. Food is no exception, but advice on what we should eat is best\nleft to the doctors and nutritionists who are aware of our \nindividual circumstances. Diets and food fads \naren't inherently wrong.
