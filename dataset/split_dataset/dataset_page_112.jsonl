Today, however, passengers flying \nthe same route can expect to spend no less than six hours\nin the air— twice as long. So why, in a world where everything \nseems to be getting faster, have commercial flights lagged behind? The British-and-French-made Concorde\nbegan shuttling passengers across the sky in the 1970s. Jetting between destinations like \nNew York, Paris, Bahrain, and Singapore, it clocked in at over 2,000 kilometers \nper hour, more than twice the speed\nof a normal airliner. However this was also about 800 kilometers\nper hour faster than the speed of sound. And that created a surprising problem \nfor people on the ground. When an object moves at supersonic speed, it generates a continuous moving shockwave\nknown as a sonic boom. This produces a loud, startling noise, as well as rattling windows and dislodging\nstructural elements of buildings. Since a plane flying at an altitude \nof 15 kilometers can affect an area with an 80 kilometer\ndiameter on the ground below, complaints and concerns from residents \nin the Concorde’s flight path restricted it to mostly ocean routes. Because of these restrictions and other\nfuel and engineering requirements, supersonic flights turned out \nto be very expensive for both airlines and passengers. A single transatlantic\nround-trip could cost the equivalent of more than $10,000 today. With additional strain \non the airline industry due to decreased demand for flights\nafter September 11th, 2001, this became unsustainable, \nand the Concorde was retired in 2003. So even when superfast flights existed,\nthey weren't standard commercial flights. And while we might think that advances \nin flight technology would make fast flights less expensive, \nthis hasn’t necessarily been the case. One of the biggest concerns \nis fuel economy. Over the decades, jet engines have become\na lot more efficient, taking in more air \nand achieving more thrust— traveling further for every\nliter of fuel. But this efficiency is only achieved \nat speeds of up to around 900 kilometers per hour—\nless than half the speed of the Concorde. Going any faster would increase air intake\nand burn more fuel per kilometer flown. A standard transatlantic flight still uses\nas much as 150,000 liters of fuel, amounting to over 20% \nof an airline’s total expenses. So any reduction in fuel economy \nand increase in speed would significantly increase both \nflight costs and environmental impact. What about ways to make a plane faster \nwithout burning lots of fuel? Adjusting the wing sweep, or the angle\nat which wings protrude from the fuselage, to bring the wings closer in can \nmake an aircraft faster by reducing aerodynamic drag. But this means the wings must be longer\nto achieve the same wingspan, and that means more materials\nand more weight, which in turn means burning more fuel. So while airplanes could be designed\nto be more aerodynamic, this would make them more expensive. And generally, airlines have found \nthat customer demand for faster flights is not sufficient to cover these costs. So while military aircraft conduct \nhigh speed flights over water and at high altitudes, supersonic commercial flights seemed\nlike a brief and failed experiment. But recent advances\nmay make them feasible again. Research by NASA and DARPA has shown \nthat modifying an aircraft’s shape can reduce the impact \nof its sonic boom by 1/3. Extending the nose with a long spike can\nbreak the shockwave into smaller ones, while another proposed design features \ntwo sets of wings producing waves \nthat cancel each other out. And new technologies may solve \nthe energy efficiency problem with alternative and synthetic fuels,\nor even hybrid-electric planes. It may yet turn out that the last \nfew decades of steady flying were just a brief rest stop."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What airline did the Concorde belong to?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "British Airways"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Virgin Airlines"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Aeroflot"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "About how long was the Concorde’s fastest transatlantic flight?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "6 hours"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4 hours"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3 hours"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why was the Concorde mostly restricted to ocean routes?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Its large shadow cast on the ground caused problems with visibility."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It caused a sonic boom affecting buildings and people below."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It was designed to make emergency sea landings."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following was NOT a reason the Concorde was retired?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ticket costs were too high."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Flying at higher speeds reduces fuel efficiency."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It was replaced by a newer supersonic model."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a design solution to reduce shockwaves?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A layer of foam shielding that absorbs the shockwaves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A nose spike to create smaller shockwaves"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A second set of wings to create a cancelling shockwave"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

You've been looking\nfor a luxury-line dinnerware set to add to your kitchen collection. As it turns out, your local department store\nhas announced a sale on the very set you've been looking for, so you rush to the store\nto find a 24-piece set on sale. Eight dinner plates,\nall in good condition; eight soup and salad bowls,\nall in good condition; and eight dessert plates,\nall in good condition. Now, consider for a moment how much you would be willing to pay\nfor this dinnerware set. Now imagine an alternate scenario. Not having seen this 24-piece luxury set, you rush to the store to find\na 40-piece dinnerware set on sale. Eight dinner plates,\nall in good condition; eight soup and salad bowls,\nall in good condition; eight dessert plates,\nall in good condition; eight cups, two of them are broken; eight saucers, seven of them are broken. Now consider for a moment how much you would be willing to pay\nfor this 40-piece dinnerware set. This is the premise of a clever\nexperiment by Christopher Hsee from the University of Chicago. It's also the question that I've asked\nhundreds of students in my classroom. What were their responses? On average, when afforded\nthe 24-piece luxury set, they were willing to spend\n390 pounds for the set. When afforded the 40-piece dinnerware set, on average, they were willing\nto spend a whopping 192 pounds for this dinnerware set. Strictly speaking, these are\nan irrational set of numbers. You'll notice the 40-piece dinnerware set includes all elements\nyou would get in the 24-piece set, plus six cups and one saucer. And not only are you not willing to spend\nwhat you will for the 24-piece set, you're only willing to spend roughly half\nof what you will for that 24-piece set. What you're witnessing here is what's referred\nto as the dilution effect. The broken items, if you will, dilute our overall perceived value\nof that entire set. Turns out this cognitive quirk\nat the checkout counter has important implications for our ability to be heard\nand listened to when we speak up. Whether you are speaking up\nagainst a failing strategy, speaking against the grain\nof a shared opinion among friends or speaking truth to power, this takes courage. Often, the points that are raised are both legitimate\nbut also shared by others. But sadly, and far too often, we see people speak up\nbut fail to influence others in the way that they had hoped for. Put another way, their message was sound, but their delivery proved faulty. If we could understand\nthis cognitive bias, it holds important implications for how we could craft\nand mold our messages to have the impact we all desire ... to be more influential as a communicator. Let's exit the aisles\nof the shopping center and enter a context in which we practice\nalmost automatically every day: the judgment of others. Let me introduce you to two individuals. Tim studies 31 hours a week\noutside of class. Tom, like Tim, also spends 31 hours\noutside of class studying. He has a brother and two sisters, he visits his grandparents, he once went on a blind date, plays pool every two months. When participants are asked to evaluate the cognitive aptitude\nof these individuals, or more importantly,\ntheir scholastic achievement, on average, people rate Tim to have a significantly higher\nGPA than that of Tom. But why? After all, both of them spend\n31 hours a week outside of class. Turns out in these contexts, when we're presented such information, our minds utilize\ntwo categories of information: diagnostic and nondiagnostic. Diagnostic information\nis information of relevance to the valuation that is being made. Nondiagnostic is information\nthat is irrelevant or inconsequential to that valuation. And when both categories\nof information are mixed, dilution occurs. The very fact that Tom\nhas a brother and two sisters or plays pool every two months dilutes the diagnostic information, or more importantly, dilutes the value and weight\nof that diagnostic information, namely that he studies\n31 hours a week outside of class. The most robust psychological explanation\nfor this is one of averaging. In this model, we take in information, and those information\nare afforded a weighted score. And our minds do not add\nthose pieces of information, but rather average\nthose pieces of information. So when you introduce irrelevant\nor even weak arguments, those weak arguments, if you will, reduce the weight\nof your overall argument. A few years ago, I landed in Philadelphia\none August evening for a conference. Having just gotten off\na transatlantic flight, I checked into my hotel room,\nput my feet up and decided to distract\nmy jet lag with some TV. An ad caught my attention. The ad was an ad\nfor a pharmaceutical drug. Now if you're the select few who've not\nhad the pleasure of witnessing these ads, the typical architecture of these ads is you might see a happy couple\nprancing through their garden, reveling in the joy that they got\na full night's sleep with the aid of the sleep drug. Because of FDA regulations, the last few seconds of this one-minute ad\nneeds to be devoted to the side effects of that drug. And what you'll typically hear\nis a hurried voice-over that blurts out \"Side effects include\nheart attack, stroke, blah, blah, blah,\" and will end with something\nlike \"itchy feet.\" (Laughter) Guess what \"itchy feet\" does\nto people's risk assessment of \"heart attack\" and \"stroke\"? It dilutes it. Imagine for a moment\nan alternate commercial that says \"This drug\ncures your sleep problems, side effects are heart attack and stroke.\" Stop. Now all of a sudden you're thinking,\n\"I don't mind staying up all night.\" (Laughter) Turns out going to sleep is important, but so is waking up. (Laughter) Let me give you\na sample from our research. So this ad that I witnessed\nessentially triggered a research project with my PhD student, Hemant,\nover the next two years. And in one of these studies, we presented participants\nan actual print ad that appeared in a magazine. [Soothing rest for mind and body.] You'll notice the last line\nis devoted to the side effects of this drug. For half of the participants, we showed the ad in its entirety, which included both major side effects\nas well as minor side effects. To the other half of the participants, we showed the same ad\nwith one small modification: we extracted just four words\nout of the sea of text. Specifically, we extracted\nthe minor side effects. And then both sets of participants\nrated that drug. What we find is that individuals\nwho were exposed to both the major side effects\nas well as the minor side effects rated the drug's overall severity\nto be significantly lower than those who were only exposed\nto the major side effects. Furthermore, they also showed\ngreater attraction towards consuming this drug. In a follow-up study, we even find that individuals\nare willing to pay more to buy the drug which they were exposed to that had both major side effects\nas well as minor side effects, compared to just major side effects alone. So it turns out pharmaceutical ads, by listing both major side effects\nas well as minor side effects, paradoxically dilute participants'\nand potential consumers' overall risk assessment of that drug. Going beyond shopping expeditions, going beyond the evaluation\nof the scholastic aptitude of others, and beyond evaluating risk\nin our environment, what this body of research tells us is that in the world of communicating\nfor the purposes of influence, quality trumps quantity. By increasing the number of arguments, you do not strengthen your case, but rather you actively weaken it. Put another way, you cannot increase\nthe quality of an argument by simply increasing\nthe quantity of your argument. The next time you want\nto speak up in a meeting, speak in favor of a government legislation\nthat you're deeply passionate about, or simply want to help a friend\nsee the world through a different lens, it is important to note that the delivery of your message\nis every bit as important as its content. Stick to your strong arguments, because your arguments don't add up\nin the minds of the receiver, they average out. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Hurme & Alejandro Rico-Guevara", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-surprising-secrets-of-hummingbird-flight-kristiina-j-hurme-alejandro-rico-guevara", "transcript": {"en": "And the clock starts... now. Did you miss it? It wasn’t some bug buzzing by \nor a weird trick of the light. You just saw a hummingbird perform\nastonishing aerial acrobatics, eat lunch in midair, pollinate a flower,\nand then escape a threat upside down— all in a matter of seconds. So let’s slow down the action, and unpack\neach step in this blazing-fast feast. First up, their incredibly rapid flight. Hummingbirds typically beat their wings \n30 to 40 times per second, creating the high-frequency hum \nthey’re named for. To flap their wings at this speed, hummingbirds have evolved \ngiant pectoral muscles that comprise over a third \nof some species’ bodyweight. But the real secret to their fine-tuned\nflight is all in the wrist. Most birds only generate lift \non the downstroke of each flap, while using the upward recovery stroke \nto set up their next wing beat. Hummingbirds however, \nturn their wrists during the upstroke, changing their wing’s angle to flap \nin a figure 8 pattern that continually generates lift \nthroughout their wingbeats. Alongside their massive muscles,\nthis special lift-producing technique allows hummingbirds to achieve \nsustained hovering flight— an aerial feat no other bird can perform. Hovering lets hummingbirds slow \nto a stop almost instantly and assess scenarios in midair. Then, they can take off in any direction, reaching speeds faster than a fighter jet,\nrelative to the bird’s size. And since they can beat each of their\nwings at different speeds and angles, the birds can perform \nincredible spins and turns all while flying backwards \nor even upside down. Of course, flying this way \ncan be exhausting. Hovering is one of the most energy\nintensive forms of movement in the animal kingdom. And relative to their body size, hummingbirds have the highest \nmetabolic rates of all vertebrates. This leads them to eat very frequently— often consuming an average \nof four meals an hour while flying. Fortunately, their hovering lets them eat\nat remarkable angles without perching, consuming food that would otherwise\nbe impossible to reach. Using their long slender bills, they reach deep inside flowers \nand pump out nectar with their thin grooved tongues. This sugary liquid is a hummingbird’s\nmost important energy source, and a single bird consumes six times \nits weight in nectar every day over hundreds of small meals. Each of these sugary snacks also \npollinates the flower being visited with pollen left on the bird \nfrom previous meals. That's just a rough idea of what\nhummingbirds can do in several seconds. But if we hang around a little longer, we might see their aerial acrobatics\nput to a more dangerous test. Hummingbirds keep track of which flowers\nthey've recently drained, as well as those they plan to drain next. And each bird will fight ruthlessly \nto defend this floral territory from their only real competition: \nother hummingbirds. Using their spear-like bills \nand blindingly fast flight, dueling hummingbirds chase each other \nthrough the air, aggressively stabbing \nand plucking feathers. The bills of some species are specialized\nfor fighting, with spiny tips, hooks, \nor even saw-like serrations. Some hummingbirds employ \nthese aerial fencing techniques to chase off larger birds \nlike hawks and owls. But the most extreme fights are between\nmale hummingbirds competing for flowers and females. Fortunately, these duels \nare rarely deadly. After 15 to 20 seconds, one bird\nwill typically surrender— flying off to seek its breakfast \nelsewhere. After all this fighting, feeding, \nand flying, hummingbirds sometimes need \nto sleep off the day’s events in a mild form of hibernation \ncalled torpor. Their hearts— proportionally \nthe largest in the animal kingdom— slow from 1,200 beats per minute \nto a mere 50. But when they wake up 4 to 7 hours later, their lightning-fast metabolism \nkicks back into gear. With all this speed and strength, it’s no wonder the Aztecs revered \nthese energetic birds as agents of the god of war \nHuitzilopotchli— a reminder that immense power \ncan come in the smallest packages."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Hummingbirds can consume up to _____ times their bodyweight in nectar in one day.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "6"}, {"label": "B", "text": " 2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20"}, {"label": "D", "text": "12"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Relative to a hummingbird’s body size, what are their speeds most similar to?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Peregrine falcon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bullet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fighter jet"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Subway train"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why do some hummingbirds most likely have serrated bills?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To help them catch bugs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To attack other hummingbirds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To pierce a flower for nectar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To safely collect spiderwebs when building nests"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The pectoral muscles can account for how much of a hummingbird’s bodyweight?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1/6"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1/3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1/10"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1/2"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which behavior might you expect to see while watching a hummingbird?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Flying backwards"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eating four meals an hour"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Flying in the same place without the help of the wind"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

For example, some people think that autistic people\nare fair-skinned males that speak in monotone and constantly go on and on\nabout the same topic. Some people think that autistic people\ndo not know right from wrong, avoid attention and usually say the wrong thing\nat the wrong time. Some people think that autistic people\nare socially awkward and lack humor and empathy. Now if you agree with what I just said, I'm sorry to tell you, but you do not have\nthe right impression of autism. How do I know? Because I have autism. I do have my own obsessions\nwith things like electronics and public transit, but that does not define me. Each of us are different\nand unique in our own way. However, there is not\na lot of information out there on what an autistic life\nactually looks like, so people often resort to stereotypes. And we see these often in the media. Some of the more common\nstereotypes in the media include being socially awkward, lacking empathy and even being a supergenius. And the lack of knowledge\non autism doesn't stop there either. Did you know that some people\nare trying to find a cure for autism? That's because they see it\nas a negative thing, as a disease. Many people are challenging the idea and to us, we think autism\nis not a disease. It's just another way of thinking\nand looking at the world. Our brains function differently\nfrom most people's brains. Think of it like comparing\nand Xbox and a PlayStation. They're both highly capable consoles\nwith different programming. But if you put your Xbox game\nin a PlayStation, it won't work, because the PlayStation\ncommunicates differently. When I look in the mirror, I see someone who thinks differently. Oh, and I also see nice hair. (Laughter) (Applause) But the question is, am I really diseased\nif I just think differently? The main problem with living autistic\nin today's society is that the world just isn't built for us. There's so many ways\nthat we can get overwhelmed. For example, the thing that makes me overwhelmed\nall the time is loud noises, which means I never\ncrank up my music really loud and I usually am not a fan\nof large parties. But other people on the spectrum\nmight get overwhelmed with things like bright lights\nor strong smells or gooey textures that all have the potential\nto create anxiety. Think about all of the social gatherings\nyou've been to in the past. Was there loud music playing? Were there really bright lights? Were there lots of different food smells\ngoing on at the same time? Were there lots of conversations\nhappening all at once? Those things may not\nhave bothered you guys, but for someone with autism, they can be quite overwhelming. So in those situations,\nwe do something called stimming, which is like a repetitive\nmotion or a noise or some other random fidgeting\nthat may or may not seem normal. Some people will flap their arms or make a noise or spin. Ya, it's basically our way of zoning out. It can often feel necessary\nfor us to stim. However, it's often frowned upon, and we're forced to hide it. When we're forced to hide\nour autistic traits like this, it's called masking. And some people mask better than others. I mask so well sometimes\nthat people don't even know I'm autistic until I give them the big reveal. (Laughs) But at the end of the day,\nit gets really stressful. Even something like\ndoing my homework at night becomes very tiring. Some people think, because of our ability to mask, that this is the cure to autism. However, all it really does\nis makes us ashamed of showing our true selves. Another common stereotype\nthat is often associated with autism is that autistic people lack empathy. And again, this is not true. I actually have lots of empathy. I'm just not really good at showing it. Whenever a friend is trying to tell me some of the struggles\nthat they're going through, I often don't know\nhow to express my reply. And that is why I don't show\nas much empathy as my nonautistic friends do. Emotional expression,\nhowever much or however little, is difficult for me. And that is because I am bursting inside with every single emotion\none feels at all times. Though of course,\nI cannot express it that way. Otherwise, let's say,\nhappiness, for example, would come out as a huge burst\nof gleeful wheezing, hand flapping and loud vocal \"woohoos.\" (Laughter) Whereas you may just smile. (Laughter) Whether it be receiving\nan awesome birthday gift or listening to a tragic\nstory on the news, I cannot really express my reply\nwithout bursting, so once again, I have to mask it\nin order to appear normal. My inner feelings are unlimited, but my mind only lets me\nexpress extremes or nothing. So my ... I am not great with my emotions, and I communicate differently, and because of that, I was diagnosed\nwith autism spectrum disorder. This diagnosis helps me\nand my friends and family to know how my mind works. And in the world, approximately one percent\nof the population is diagnosed with autism\nspectrum disorder. And this number is growing. However, we are still a big minority. And there's still lots of people\nthat do not see us as equals to other people. This is my family. And in my family, there is one other person\nwho is also autistic. My mother. Yes, adult women can also be autistic. My dad and my brother\nare both nonautistic. Sometimes it can be a bit difficult\nfor us to communicate with each other, however. Sometimes I'll say something like, \"Oh, Toronto's Union Station, right?\" thinking that I can help them to remember\ncertain aspects of it. When they get confused, I often\nhave to elaborate myself on that. And we often have to say things in a number of different ways\nso that everyone understands. However, despite all that, we all love each other\nand respect each other as equals. In his book \"NeuroTribes,\" author Steve Silberman states\nthat autism and other mental conditions should be seen as naturally human, naturally part of a human spectrum and not as defects. And this is something\nthat I agree to completely. If autism was seen as part\nof a natural human spectrum, then the world could be designed\nto work better for autistic people. I am not ashamed of my autism. And I may not think like you, or act like you, but I am still human\nand I am not diseased. Thank you.

The candidates are a giant orange troll\nand an experienced tree statesman. An all-powerful eyebrow has hired \nyour company— The Dormor Polling Agency— to survey the citizens of the land\nand predict who will win. There’s a lot riding on this: if you get it wrong, heads— \nwell, your head— will quite literally roll. Your job is to go from door to door, asking voters whether they prefer\nthe troll or the treefellow and to use the results to project \nhow the election will go. Your fellow citizens want you to succeed\nand would tell you the truth... but there’s a problem. Few are willing to admit \nthey support the troll on account of his controversial \nlife choices. If you were to ask a troll supporter\nwho she'll vote for, there’s a good chance that she’ll claim \nto support the treeman, skewing your results. You’re about to begin your rounds when \na stranger offers you some cryptic advice: “Here’s the question that will save your\nneck: what have you got in your pocket?” You reach into your pocket and pull out...\na silver coin, which has the current king’s head \non one side and his tail on the other. How can you use it to conduct\nan accurate poll? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to use the coin \nto add random chance to your interaction that will give \ntroll supporters deniability. In other words, you’re looking for \na system where when someone says “troll,” it could either be because the coin \nsomehow told them to, or because they actually \nsupport the troll— and you’d have no way to tell \nthe difference. You’ll also need to know how frequently \nthe coin skewed the results, so you can account\nfor it in your calculations. One solution is to have every pollee \ngo into their house and flip the coin. If it lands heads, they should\ntell you “troll,” whether or not they actually support him. If it lands tails, they should tell \nyou their actual preference. Here’s what happens: you poll 200 voters, and 130 say \nthey’ll vote for the troll. For about 50%, or 100 of them,\nthe coin will have landed heads. So you can subtract 100 troll votes \noff his total, and know the troll’s real support \nis 30 to 70, and he’s very likely to lose. The election comes around,\nbut before the results can be certified a third party candidate swoops in \nand burns the treefellow to a crisp. The freshly signed and deeply flawed\nconstitution mandates that this challenger gets to take his victim’s place \nin a new election. The Dormor Polling Agency sends you back \nout on the streets with your trusty coin. Only this time no one is comfortable\nadmitting their preference: supporting the troll is still shameful, and nobody wants to express support of a\ndragon who murdered his way into the race. But your job is your job. \nHow do you conduct an accurate poll now? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 This time, instead of masking \njust one candidate preference, you need some way to disguise both. At the same time, you also need to leave \nspace for some portion of the people polled to express their true preference. But a coin toss only has two\npossible outcomes... right? Suppose you have everyone\nflip the coin twice— now there are four possible results. You can tell the people who flip heads\ntwice in a row to report support for the troll; those who get tails \ntwice in a row to report dragon; and those with any other combination\nto declare their true preference. The chances of getting either\ntwo heads or two tails in a row are 50% times 50%— \nor 25%. Subtracting that proportion \nof the total respondents from each candidate’s score should \ngive you something close to the real distribution. This time, 105 respondents announced \nthemselves in favor of the troll and 95 for the dragon. Out of the total, the coin will make 25% or 50 respond troll \nand another 50 respond dragon. Subtracting 50 from each result reveals\nthat voters seem to prefer the troll by a margin of about 55 to 45. It’s close, but as predicted,\nthe troll wins the election, and you live to poll another day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Suppose there are two candidates A and B.

{"page": 112, "lesson": 6, "title": "What’s the best fuel for your car?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-s-the-best-fuel-for-your-car", "transcript": {"en": "Historically, most cars have run \non gasoline, but that doesn’t have to be\nthe case in the future: other liquid fuels and electricity\ncan also power cars. So what are the differences \nbetween these options? And which one’s best? Gasoline is refined from crude oil, a fossil fuel extracted\nfrom deep underground. The energy in gasoline comes from a class\nof molecules called hydrocarbons. There are hundreds of different\nhydrocarbons in crude oil, and different ones are used \nto make gasoline and diesel— which is why you can't use\nthem interchangeably. Fuels derived from crude oil\nare extremely energy dense, bringing a lot of bang for your buck. Unfortunately, they have many drawbacks. Oil spills cause environmental damage\nand cost billions of dollars to clean up. Air pollution from burning \nfossil fuels like these kills 4.5 million people each year. And transportation accounts for 16%\nof global greenhouse gas emissions, almost half of which comes \nfrom passenger cars burning fossil fuels. These emissions warm the planet \nand make weather more extreme. In the U.S. alone,\nstorms caused by climate change caused $500 billion of damage \nin the last five years. So while gas is efficient, something so destructive\ncan't be the best fuel. The most common alternative\nis electricity. Electric cars use a battery pack\nand electric motor instead of the internal combustion engine\nfound in gas-powered cars, and must be charged at charging stations. With the right power infrastructure, they\ncan be as efficient as gas-powered cars. If powered by electricity generated\nwithout fossil fuels, they can avoid greenhouse gas emissions \nentirely. They’re more expensive \nthan gas-powered cars, but the cost difference has been\nshrinking rapidly since 2010. The other alternatives to gasoline\nare other liquid fuels. Many of these can be shipped and stored\nusing the same infrastructure as gasoline, and used in the same cars. They can also be carbon-neutral \nif they’re made using carbon dioxide from the atmosphere— meaning when we burn them, we release that\nsame carbon dioxide back into the air, and don't add to overall emissions. One approach to carbon-neutral fuel\nis to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combine its carbon\nwith the hydrogen in water. This creates hydrocarbons, \nthe source of energy in fossil fuels— but without any emissions if the fuels \nare made using clean electricity. These fuels take up more space than an energetically equivalent\namount of gasoline— an obstacle to using them in cars. Another approach is to make carbon-neutral\nfuels from plants, which sequester carbon from the air \nthrough photosynthesis. But growing the plants also has \nto be carbon neutral— which rules out many crops\nthat require fertilizer, a big contributor \nto greenhouse gas emissions. So the next generation of these fuels\nmust be made from either plant waste or plants that don't require\nfertilizer to grow. Biofuels can be about as efficient\nas gasoline, though not all are. For a fuel to be the best option, \npeople have to be able to afford it. Unfortunately, the high upfront costs\nof implementing new technologies and heavy subsidies for the producers \nof fossil fuels, mean that almost every green technology is more expensive than \nits fossil-fuel-based cousin. This cost difference is known\nas a green premium. Governments have already started\nsubsidizing electric vehicles to help make up the difference. In some places, depending \non the costs of electricity and gas, electric cars can already\nbe cheaper overall, despite the higher cost of the car. The other alternatives are trickier, \nfor now— zero-carbon liquid fuels can be\ndouble the price of gasoline or more. Innovators are doing everything\nthey can to bring green premiums down, because in the end, the best fuel \nwill be both affordable for consumers and sustainable for our planet."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is a drawback of using fuels from crude oil?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oil spills and costly environmental damage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Air pollution that causes health risks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What are some alternatives to fossil fuels?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Biofuels"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hydrogen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Electrofuels"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "True or false?

Just like many of you here today,\nwe had experienced and heard stories about race, about prejudice,\ndiscrimination and stereotyping and we were like, \"We get it,\nracism, we got it, we got it.\" But we weren't even close. Winona Guo: So we decided\nthat we had to listen and learn more. We talked to as many\nrandom people as we could and collected hundreds\nof personal stories about race, stories that revealed how racial injustice\nis a nationwide epidemic that we ourselves spread and now can't seem\nto recognize or get rid of. PV: We're not there yet. Today, we are here to raise\nour standards of racial literacy, to redefine what it means\nto be racially literate. WG: We want everywhere\nacross the United States for our youngest and future generations\nto grow up equipped with the tools to understand,\nnavigate and improve a world structured by racial division. We want us all to imagine\nthe community as a place where we not only feel proud\nof our own backgrounds, but can also invest in others'\nexperiences as if they were our own. PV: We just graduated\nfrom high school this past June. WG: And you'd think -- (Applause) And you'd think after 12 years somebody in or out of the classroom\nwould have helped us understand -- PV: At a basic level at least -- WG: The society we live in. PV: The truth for almost\nall our classmates is that they don't. WG: In communities around our country,\nso many of which are racially divided, PV: If you don't go searching\nfor an education about race, for racial literacy -- WG: You won't get it. It won't just come to you. PV: Even when we did\nhave conversations about race, our understanding was always superficial. We realized that there are two big gaps in our racial literacy. WG: First, the heart gap: an inability to understand\neach of our experiences, to fiercely and unapologetically\nbe compassionate beyond lip service. PV: And second, the mind gap: an inability to understand the larger,\nsystemic ways in which racism operates. WG: First, the heart gap. To be fair, race did pop up\na few times in school, growing up. We all defend our social justice education because we learned\nabout Martin Luther King Jr. and Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks. But even in all of those conversations, race always felt outdated, like, \"Yes, slavery, that happened\nonce upon a time, but why does it really matter now?\" As a result, we didn't really care. But what if our teacher introduced\na story from the present day, for example, how Treniya\ntold us in Pittsburgh that -- PV: \"My sister was scrolling through\nFacebook and typed in our last name. This white guy popped up, and we found out that his\ngreat-great-grandfather owned slaves and my great-great-\ngreat-grandmother was one of them. My last name -- it's not who I am. We've been living\nunder a white man's name. If slavery didn't happen,\nwho would I even be?\" WG: Now it feels relevant, immediate, because the connection to slavery's\nlasting legacy today is made clear, right? Or what would happen is our teacher\nwould throw out these cold statistics. You've probably seen this one before\nin news headlines. PV: African-Americans are incarcerated more than five times\nthe rate of white people. WG: Now consider Ronnie, in Seattle. PV: \"My father means everything to me. He's all I've got, I don't know my mother. My father's currently being\nwrongly incarcerated for 12 years. I've got a daughter, and I try to be\nthat same fatherly figure for her: always involved in everything she does,\nit might even be annoying at some points. But I'm afraid I'll go missing in her life just like my father did in mine.\" WG: Throwing out just the statistic,\njust the facts alone, disconnected from real humans, can lead to dangerously incomplete\nunderstanding of those facts. It fails to recognize that for many people\nwho don't understand racism the problem is not a lack of knowledge to talk about the pain\nof white supremacy and oppression, it's that they don't recognize\nthat that pain exists at all. They don't recognize the human beings\nthat are being affected, and they don't feel enough to care. PV: Second, the mind gap. We can't ignore the stats, either. We can't truly grasp Ronnie's situation without understanding how things\nlike unjust laws and biased policing systematic racism has created the disproportionate\nincarceration rates over time. Or like how in Honolulu, the large prison population\nof native Hawaiians like Kimmy is heavily influenced\nby the island's long history with US colonialization, its impact passing down\nthrough generations to today. For us, sometimes we would talk about people's personal,\nunique experiences in the classroom. Stuff like, how Justin once told us -- WG: \"I've been working on psychologically\nreclaiming my place in this city. Because for me, my Chicago\nisn't the nice architecture downtown, it's not the North Side. My Chicago is the orange line,\nthe pink line, the working immigrant class going on the train.\" PV: And while we might have\nacknowledged his personal experience, we wouldn't have talked\nabout how redlining and the legalized segregation of our past created the racially divided\nneighborhoods we live in today. We wouldn't have completely understood how racism is embedded in the framework\nof everything around us, because we would stay narrowly focused\non people's isolated experiences. Another example,\nSandra in DC once told us: WG: \"When I'm with my Korean family,\nI know how to move with them. I know what to do in order to have them\nfeel like I care about them. And making and sharing food is one of the most fundamental\nways of showing love. When I'm with my partner\nwho's not Korean, however, we've had to grapple with the fact that I'm very food-centric\nand he's just not. One time he said that he didn't\nwant to be expected to make food for me, and I got really upset.\" PV: That might seem like a weird reaction, but only if we don't recognize\nhow it's emblematic of something larger, something deeper. Intragenerational trauma. How in Sandra's family,\nwidespread hunger and poverty existed as recently\nas Sandra's parents' generation and therefore impacts Sandra today. She experiences someone saying -- WG: \"I don't want to feed you.\" PV: As -- WG: \"I don't want to hug you.\" PV: And without her and her partner\nhaving that nuanced understanding of her reaction and the historical\ncontext behind it, it could easily lead\nto unnecessary fighting. That's why it's so important\nthat we proactively -- (Both speaking): Co-create -- PV: A shared American culture that identifies and embraces\nthe different values and norms within our diverse communities. WG: To be racially literate -- PV: To understand who we are\nso that we can heal together -- WG: We cannot neglect the heart -- PV: Or the mind. So, with our hundreds of stories, we decided to publish\na racial literacy textbook to bridge that gap\nbetween our hearts and minds. WG: Our last book, \"The Classroom Index,\" shares deeply personal stories. PV: And pairs those personal stories to the brilliant research\nof statisticians and scholars. WG: Every day, we are still\nblown away by people's experiences, by the complexity\nof our collective racial reality. PV: So today, we ask you -- WG: Are you racially literate? Are you there yet? PV: Do you really understand\nthe people around you, their stories, stories like these? It's not just knowing\nthat Louise from Seattle survived Japanese American\ninternment camps. It's knowing that, meanwhile, her husband was one of an estimated\n33,000 Japanese Americans who fought for our country during the war, a country that was simultaneously\ninterning their families. For most of us, those Japanese Americans\nboth in camps and in service, now see their bravery, their resilience,\ntheir history forgotten. They've become only victims. PV: It's not just knowing\nthat interracial marriages like Shermaine and Paul in DC exist, it's acknowledging that our society\nhas been programmed for them to fail. That on their very first date\nsomeone shouted, \"Why are you with that black whore?\" That according to a Columbia study\non cis straight relationships black is often equated with masculinity and Asian with femininity, leading more men to not value black women\nand to fetishize Asian women. Among black-white marriages\nin the year 2000, 73 percent had a black husband\nand a white wife. Paul and Shermaine defy that statistic. Black is beautiful, but it takes a lot to believe so\nonce society says otherwise. WG: It's not just knowing\nthat white people like Lisa in Chicago have white privilege, it's reflecting consciously\non the term whiteness and its history, knowing that whiteness\ncan't be equated with American. It's knowing that Lisa can't forget\nher own personal family's history of Jewish oppression. That she can't forget how, growing up, she was called a dirty Jew\nwith horns and tails. But Lisa knows she can pass as white so she benefits from huge systemic\nand interpersonal privileges, and so she spends every day grappling with ways that she can\nleverage that white privilege for social justice. For example, starting conversations\nwith other people of privilege about race. Or shifting the power\nin her classroom to her students by learning to listen to their experiences\nof racism and poverty. PV: It's not just knowing\nthat native languages are dying. It's appreciating how fluency\nin the Cherokee language, which really only less\nthan 12,000 people speak today, is an act of survival,\nof preservation of culture and history. It's knowing how\nthe nongendered Cherokee language enabled Ahyoka's acceptance\nas a trans woman in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Her grandmother told her firmly\na saying in Cherokee, \"I don't tell me who you are, you tell me who you are. And that is who you are.\" WG: These are just parts of a few stories. There are approximately\n323 million people in the United States. PV: And 7.4 billion people on the planet. WG: So we have a lot to listen to. PV: And a lot to learn. WG: We need to raise the bar. PV: Elevate our standards\nfor racial literacy. Because without investing\nin an education that values -- WG: Both the stories --\nPV: And statistics -- WG: The people --\nPV: And the numbers -- WG: The interpersonal --\nPV: And the systemic -- WG: There will always be a piece missing. PV: Today, so few of us\nunderstand each other. WG: We don't know how to communicate -- PV: Live together --\nWG: Love one another. We need to all work together\nto create a new national community. PV: A new shared culture\nof mutual suffering and celebration. WG: We need to each begin by learning\nin our own local communities, bridging the gaps between\nour own hearts and minds to become racially literate. PV: Once we all do,\nwe will be that much closer to living in spaces and systems\nthat fight and care equally for all of us. WG: Then, none of us\nwill be able to remain distant. PV: We couldn't -- sorry,\nmom and dad, college can wait. WG: We're on a gap year before college,\ntraveling to all 50 states collecting stories for our next book. PV: And we still have 23 states\nleft to interview in. (Both) Let's all get to work. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Electricity from coal requires mines,\nand plants to burn it and convert the heat into electricity. Nuclear power takes uranium mines,\nfacilities to refine the uranium, a reactor, and a place to store \nthe spent fuel safely. Renewable energy needs wind turbines \nor solar panels. How much space depends\non the power source. Say you wanted to power a 10-watt \nlight bulb with fossil fuels like coal. Fossil fuels can produce \nup to 2,000 watts per square meter, so it would only take a credit card-sized\nchunk of land to power the light bulb. With nuclear power, you might only\nneed an area about the size of the palms of your hands. With solar power, you’d need at least\n0.3 square meters of land— twice the size of a cafeteria tray. Wind power would take roughly\n7 square meters— about half the size of a parking space— \nto power the bulb. When you consider the space needed \nto power cities, countries, and the whole world,\nit adds up fast. Today, the world uses 3 trillion watts \nof electricity. To power the entire world \nwith only fossil fuels, you’d need at least about 1,200\nsquare kilometers of space— roughly the area of Grand Bahama island. With nuclear energy, you’d need almost\nfour times as much space at a minimum— roughly 4,000 square kilometers, \na little less than the area of Delaware. With solar, you’d need at least\n95,000 square kilometers, approximately the area of South Korea. With wind power, you’d need two million—\nabout the area of Mexico. For each power source, there’s variability\nin how much power it can generate per square meter, but these numbers give us a general\nsense of the space needed. Of course, building energy infrastructure\nin a desert, a rainforest, a town, or even in the ocean \nare completely different prospects. And energy sources monopolize the space \nthey occupy to very different extents. Take wind power. Wind turbines need to be spread out—\nsometimes half a kilometer apart— so that the turbulence from one turbine doesn’t reduce the efficiency \nof the others. So, much of the land needed \nto generate wind power is still available for other uses. But the baseline amount of space\nstill matters, because cities and other densely populated\nareas have high electricity demands, and space near them is often limited. Our current power infrastructure \nworks best when electricity is generated\nwhere and when it’s needed, rather than being stored or sent\nacross long distances. Still, space demands are only\npart of the equation. As of 2020, 2/3 of our electricity\ncomes from fossil fuels. Every year, electricity generation \nis responsible for about 27% of the more than 50 billion tons \nof greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, accelerating climate change \nand all its harms. So although fossil fuels require the least\nspace of our existing technologies, we can’t continue to rely on them. Cost is another consideration. Nuclear plants don’t emit greenhouse gases\nand don’t require much space, but they’re way more expensive to build\nthan solar panels or wind turbines, and have waste to deal with. Renewables have almost no marginal costs— unlike with plants powered \nby fossil fuels, you don’t need to keep purchasing fuel \nto generate electricity. But you do need lots of wind and sunlight, which are more available in some places \nthan others. No single approach will be\nthe best option to power the entire world while eliminating\nharmful greenhouse gas emissions. For some places, nuclear power\nmight be the best option for replacing fossil fuels. Others, like the U.S., \nhave the natural resources to get most or all of their electricity \nfrom renewables. And across the board, we should be working\nto make our power sources better: safer in the case of nuclear, and easier to store and transport \nin the case of renewables."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "To produce electricity from nuclear power, we need ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Uranium mines"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To burn plants"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Solar panels"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wind turbine"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "True or false?

Schulte", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-secret-signals-elephants-use-to-communicate-chase-ladue-and-bruce-a-schulte", "transcript": {"en": "As a breeze blows through the savannah, a snake-shaped tube stretches into the air\nand scans the horizon like a periscope. But it’s not seeing— \nit’s sniffing for odors like the scent of a watering hole \nor the musk of a dangerous predator. The trunk’s owner \nis a young African elephant. At only 8 years old, she still has \na lot to learn about her home. Fortunately, she’s not alone. Elephants are extremely social creatures, with females living in tight-knit herds \nled by a single matriarch. And every member of the group \nhas one of the most versatile tools in the savannah to help them get by. Today her herd is looking for water. Or, more accurately, smelling for water. Elephants have more genes devoted \nto smell than any other creature, making them the best sniffers\nin the animal kingdom. Even at our elephant’s young age,\nher trunk is already 1.5 meters long and contains five times as many \nolfactory receptors as a human nose, allowing her to smell standing water\nseveral kilometers away. And now, the matriarch uses her own keen\nsense of smell to plot the herd’s course. Their journey is long,\nso our elephant keeps her energy up by snacking on the occasional patch \nof thick grass. But this light lunch \nisn’t just about staying fed— she’s also looking for clues. Like many other mammals, vents in the roof of an elephant’s mouth \nlead directly to the vomeronasal organ. This structure can detect chemical\nsignals left by other elephants. So as the herd forages, \nthey’re also gathering information about what other herds have come this way. All the while, the group’s adults are \non the lookout for signs of other animals, including potential threats. Fortunately, while lions might attack\na young or sickly elephant, few are foolish enough to take \non a healthy adult. Weighing 3 tons and bearing powerful tusks\nnearly a meter long, our elephant’s mother is a force\nto be reckoned with. Her dexterous trunk doubles \nas a powerful, flexible arm. Containing no bones\nand an estimated 40,000 muscles, these agile appendages \ncan bend, twist, contract, and expand. At 8 years old, our elephant’s trunk\nis already strong enough to move small fallen trees, while finger-like extensions allow for \ndelicate maneuvers like wiping her eye. She can even grab a nearby branch, break it to just the right length,\nand wave off pesky insects. Suddenly, the matriarch stops their march\nand sniffs the air. Using smell alone, elephants can recognize\neach member of their herd, and their exceptional memories can \nretain the smells of elephants outside their herd as well. It’s one of these old but familiar odors\nthat’s caught the matriarch’s attention. She bellows into the air, sending out a sound wave \nthat rings across the savannah. But it travels even further\nthrough the earth as infrasonic rumbles. Elephants up to 10 kilometers away can\nreceive these rumbles with their feet. If the matriarch’s nose is right,\nher herd should expect a response. Smelling the secretions \nfrom her daughter’s temporal glands, our elephant’s mother can sense \nher daughter’s unease about this unfamiliar encounter. As the herd of unknown\nelephants approaches, trunks from both herds rise into the air,\nsounding trumpets of alarm. But upon recognition, apprehension \nquickly gives way to happy rumbles. Members from each herd recognize\neach other despite time apart, and many investigate each other’s mouths\nwith their trunks to smell what their counterparts \nhave been eating. With the reunion now in full swing, both\nherds head toward their final destination: the long-awaited watering hole.

And at the center of that gathering \nis the world’s most exclusive club, where under the full moon, \nthe annual logician’s rave takes place. The entry is guarded \nby the Demon of Reason, and the only way to get in is to solve\none of his dastardly challenges. You’re attending with 23 \nof your closest logician friends, but you got lost on the way \nto the rave and arrived late. They're already inside, so you must\nface down the demon alone. He poses you the following question: When your friends arrived,\nthe demon put masks on their faces and forbade them from communicating\nin any way. No one at any point could\nsee their own masks, but they stood in a circle where they\ncould see everyone else’s. The demon told the logicians that he \ndistributed the masks in such a way that each person would eventually be able \nto figure out their mask’s color using logic alone. Then, once every two minutes,\nhe rang a bell. At that point, anyone who could\ncome to him and tell him the color of their mask \nwould be admitted. Here’s what happened: Four logicians got in at the first bell. Some number of logicians, all in red \nmasks, got in at the second bell. Nobody got in when the third bell rang. Logicians wearing at least two different\ncolors got in at the fourth bell. All 23 of your friends played \nthe game perfectly logically and eventually got inside. Your challenge, the demon explains, is to tell him how many people gained\nentry when the fifth bell rang. Can you get into the rave? Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s initially difficult to imagine \nhow anyone could, using just logic and the colors\nthey see on the other masks, deduce their own mask color. But even before the first bell, everyone\nwill realize something critical. Let’s imagine a single logician\nwith a silver mask. When she looks around, she’d see \nmultiple colors, but no silver. So she couldn’t ever know that silver \nis an option, making it impossible for her to logically \ndeduce that she must be silver. That contradicts rule five, so there must\nbe at least two masks of each color. Now, let’s think about what happens when there are exactly two people wearing \nthe same color mask. Each of them sees only one mask \nof that color. But because they already know \nthat it can’t be the only one, they immediately know that their own mask \nis the other. This must be what happened\nbefore the first bell: two pairs of logicians each realized\ntheir own mask colors when they saw a unique color in the room. What happens if there are three people \nwearing the same color? Each of them—A, B and C—\nsees two people with that color. From A’s perspective, B and C would be\nexpected to behave the same way that the orange and purple pairs did, \nleaving at the first bell. When that doesn’t happen, each of the three realizes that they are \nthe third person with that color, and all three leave at the next bell. That was what the people \nwith red masks did— so there must have been three of them. We’ve now established a basis \nfor inductive reasoning. Induction is where we can solve \nthe simplest case, then find a pattern that will allow \nthe same reasoning to apply \nto successively larger sets. The pattern here is that everyone \nwill know what group they’re in as soon as the previously sized group\nhas the opportunity to leave. After the second bell, \nthere were 16 people. No one left on the third bell, so everyone then knew there weren’t \nany groups of four. Multiple groups,\nwhich must have been of five, left on the fourth bell. Three groups would\nleave a solitary mask wearer, which isn’t possible, \nso it must’ve been two groups. And that leaves six logicians outside \nwhen the fifth bell rings: the answer to the demon’s riddle. Nothing left to do but join your friends \nand dance."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "If there are only two red masks and four green masks, when do the reds gain entry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the first bell"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the second bell"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the third bell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "never"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "If there are only two red masks and four green masks, when do the greens gain entry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the first bell"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the second bell"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the third bell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "never"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If there are only three red masks and four green masks, when do the reds gain entry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the first bell"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the second bell"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the third bell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "never"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If there are only three red masks and four green masks, when do the greens gain entry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the first bell"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the second bell"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the third bell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "never"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If there are only two red masks, two yellow masks and five green masks, when do the greens gain entry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the first bell"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the second bell"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the third bell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the fourth bell"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Dawson", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-causes-dandruff-and-how-do-you-get-rid-of-it-thomas-l-dawson", "transcript": {"en": "Here in this abundant forest, Malassezia is equipped with everything \nit could ever need. Feasting constantly, it’s in paradise. But wait— what’s this? In fact, Malassezia is a type of yeast \nthat lives and dines on all of our scalps. And in about half of the human population,\nits activity causes dandruff. So, why do some people have\nmore dandruff than others? And how can it be treated? We might consider ourselves individuals,\nbut we’re really colonies. Our skin hosts billions of microbes. Malassezia yeasts make themselves at home\non our skin shortly after we’re born. Follicles, the tiny cavities that grow\nhairs all over our body, make for especially popular \nliving quarters. Malassezia are fond of these hideouts\nbecause they contain glands that secrete an oil called sebum that’s thought to lubricate \nand strengthen our hair. Malassezia evolved to consume \nour skin’s proteins and oils. And because of its many sebum-secreting \nfollicles, our scalp is one of the oiliest places\non our body— and consequently, one of the yeastiest. As these fungi feast on our scalp’s oils,\ndandruff may form. This is because sebum is composed of both\nsaturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fats neatly pack together. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, contain double bonds that create \nan irregular kink in their structure. Malassezia eat sebum by secreting\nan enzyme that releases all of the oil’s \nfatty acids. But they only consume the saturated fats,\nleaving the unsaturated ones behind. These irregularly shaped leftovers \nsoak into the skin and pry its barrier open,\nallowing water to escape. The body detects these breaches \nand responds defensively, causing the inflammation \nthat gives dandruff it’s itch. It also makes the skin cells proliferate\nto repair the damaged barrier. Usually, our skin’s outer surface, \nor epidermis, completely renews itself \nevery two to three weeks, Epidermal cells divide, \nmove outwards, die, and form the skin’s tough outer layer, which gradually sheds off in single cells \nfar too small to see. But with dandruff, cells churn out quickly\nto correct the broken barrier, meaning they don’t mature \nand differentiate properly. Instead, they form large, greasy clumps\naround the hair follicle that are shed as visible flakes. This is how Malassezia’s \nvoracious appetite and our bodies reaction \nto its by-products lead to dandruff. Currently, the most effective way to get\nrid of dandruff is by using antifungals \nin things like shampoos, applied directly to the scalp, \nto kill Malassezia. For those who experience dandruff, it usually comes and goes as sebum\nsecretions vary throughout one's lifetime due to hormonal changes. But despite the fact that Malassezia \ncolonize everyone to a similar extent, not everyone gets dandruff. Some people are more susceptible. Exactly why is unclear. Do people with dandruff have a certain \ngenetic predisposition? Is their skin barrier more permeable? Scientists are currently investigating \nif people with dandruff do, in fact, lose more water through their scalps, and whether this is what’s leading \ntheir skin cells to proliferate. Researchers are learning that Malassezia\ncommunicate with our immune system using small, oily molecules called \noxylipins that regulate inflammation. If they can find a way to inhibit\ninflammatory oxylipins and boost anti-inflammatory ones, \nthey could develop new treatments. Scientists are also investigating \nif there’s any benefit to our relationship with Malassezia. They hypothesize that dandruff, which can be uncomfortable\nand embarrassing for us, creates a reliable, oily \nfood source for the yeast. But dandruff isn’t contagious \nor a great threat to our health. And Malassezia seem to excel\nat defending their territory, our skin, from other, more harmful microbes\nlike Staphylococcus aureus.

Peffer", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-artist-who-won-a-nobel-prize-in-medicine-melanie-e-peffer", "transcript": {"en": "In the late 1860s, scientists believed\nthey were on the verge of uncovering the brain’s biggest secret. They already knew the brain controlled\nthe body through electrical impulses. The question was, how did these signals\ntravel through the body without changing or degrading? It seemed that perfectly transmitting \nthese impulses would require them to travel uninterrupted\nalong some kind of tissue. This idea, called reticular theory, imagined the nervous system \nas a massive web of tissue that physically connected \nevery nerve cell in the body. Reticular theory captivated the field\nwith its elegant simplicity. But soon, a young artist would cut through\nthis conjecture, and sketch a bold new vision \nof how our brains work. 60 years before reticular theory was born, developments in microscope technology revealed cells to be the building blocks \nof organic tissue. This finding was revolutionary, but early microscopes struggled\nto provide additional details. The technology was especially challenging\nfor researchers studying the brain. Soft nervous tissue was\ndelicate and difficult to work with. And even when researchers were able\nto get it under the microscope, the tissue was so densely packed \nit was impossible to see much. To improve their view, scientists began experimenting \nwith special staining techniques designed to provide clarity \nthrough contrast. The most effective came courtesy\nof Camillo Golgi in 1873. First, Golgi hardened the brain tissue \nwith potassium bichromate to prevent cells from deforming \nduring handling. Then he doused the tissue \nin silver nitrate, which visibly accumulated in nerve cells. Known as the “black reaction,” Golgi’s Method finally allowed researchers\nto see the entire cell body of what would later be named the neuron. The stain even highlighted \nthe fibrous branches that shot off from the cell \nin different directions. Images of these branches\nbecame hazy at the ends, making it difficult to determine exactly\nhow they fit into the larger network. But Golgi concluded that these\nbranches connected, forming a web of tissue comprising\nthe entire nervous system. 14 years later, a young scientist\nand aspiring artist named Santiago Ramón y Cajal \nbegan to build on Golgi’s work. While writing a book \nabout microscopic imaging, he came across a picture of a cell\ntreated with Golgi’s stain. Cajal was in awe of its exquisite detail—\nboth as a scientist and an artist. He soon set out to improve\nGolgi’s stain even further and create more detailed references\nfor his artwork. By staining the tissue twice\nin a specific time frame, Cajal found he could stain a greater\nnumber of neurons with better resolution. And what these new slides revealed\nwould upend reticular theory— the branches reaching out \nfrom each nerve cell were not physically connected \nto any other tissue. So how were these individual cells \ntransmitting electrical signals? By studying and sketching\nthem countless times, Cajal developed a bold, new hypothesis. Instead of electrical signals traveling\nuninterrupted across a network of fibers, he proposed that signals were somehow\njumping from cell to cell in a linear chain of activation. The idea that electrical signals could\ntravel this way was completely unheard of when Cajal proposed it in 1889. However his massive collection of drawings\nsupported his hypothesis from every angle. And in the mid-1900s, electron microscopy\nfurther supported this idea by revealing a membrane \naround each nerve cell keeping it separate from its neighbors. This formed the basis \nof the “neuron doctrine,” which proposed the brain’s tissue \nwas made up of many discrete cells, instead of one connected tissue. The neuron doctrine laid the foundation \nfor modern neuroscience, and allowed later researchers to discover \nthat electrical impulses are constantly converted between\nchemical and electrical signals as they travel from neuron to neuron. Both Golgi and Cajal received \nthe Nobel Prize for their separate, \nbut shared discoveries, and researchers still apply \ntheir theories and methods today. In this way, their legacies remain\nconnected as discrete elements in a vast network of knowledge."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is reticular theory?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nervous system is made up of single cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nervous system is made up of a single structure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nervous system is made up of reticules"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nervous system is made up of many structures"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a reason why brain tissue was hard for scientists to study?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Brain tissue is hard to get"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Brain tissue is very soft"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Brain tissue contains tightly packed cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Brain tissue is very delicate"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What technique did scientists invent to help see cells under the microscope?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Better microscope lenses"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Better light sources for the microscopes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stains that created contrast"}, {"label": "D", "text": "New ways of cutting tissues to get smaller pieces to look at under the microscope"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What did Cajal find when he used an improve stain on brain tissue?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The brain was made up of a single structure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The brain was made up of reticules"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The brain was made up of cells physically connected to one another"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The brain was made up of single cells not physically connected to one another"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How did Cajal use his art to inform his discovery?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Repeated drawing and sketching led him to conclude that cells were not physically connected and instead communicated with each other electrically"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He drew pictures of the cells under the microscope and showed them to colleagues who realized that there were separate cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He sketched both the cells and the chemicals in between them showing how they talk to one another"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Repeated drawing and sketching led him to believe that the brain was made up of a single structure"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Officials named the body the Lindow Man and determined that he’d suffered \nserious injuries, including blunt trauma and strangulation. But the most shocking thing \nabout this gruesome story was that they were able to determine these\ndetails from a body over 2,000 years old. Typically, decomposition would make\nsuch injuries hard to detect on a body buried just weeks earlier. So why was this corpse \nso perfectly preserved? And why don't all bodies\nstay in this condition? The answers to these questions\nlive six feet underground. It may not appear very lively down here, but a single teaspoon of soil \ncontains more organisms than there are human beings on the planet. From bacteria and algae \nto fungi and protozoa, soils are home to one quarter of Earth’s\nbiodiversity. And perhaps the soil’s most important \ninhabitants are microbes, organisms no larger \nthan several hundred nanometers that decompose all the planet’s \ndead and dying organic material. Imagine we drop an apple in the forest. As soon as it contacts the soil, worms and other invertebrates begin\nbreaking it down into smaller parts; absorbing nutrients from what they consume\nand excreting the rest. This first stage of decomposition\nsets the scene for microbes. The specific microbes present\ndepend on the environment. For example, in grasslands and farm fields\nthere tend to be more bacteria, which excel at breaking down \ngrass and leaves. But in this temperate forest \nthere are more fungi, capable of breaking down \ncomplex woody materials. Looking to harvest more food\nfrom the apple’s remains, these microbes release enzymes that trigger a chemical reaction\ncalled oxidation. This breaks down the molecules \nof organic matter, releasing energy, carbon, and other nutrients \nin a process called mineralization. Then microbes consume the carbon\nand some nutrients, while excess molecules of nitrogen, \nsulfur, calcium, and more are left behind in the soil. As insects and worms eat\nmore of the apple, they expose more surface area \nfor these microbial enzymes to oxidize and mineralize. Even the excretions they leave behind\nare mined by microbes. This continues until the apple\nis reduced to nothing— a process that would take one to two\nmonths in a temperate forest. Environments that are hot and wet \nsupport more microbes than places that are cold and dry, allowing them to decompose things\nmore quickly. And less complex organic materials \nbreak down faster. But given enough time, all organic matter is reduced \nto microscopic mineral nutrients. The atomic bonds between these molecules\nare too strong to break down any further. So instead, \nthese nutrients feed plant life, which grow more food that will\neventually decompose. This constant cycle of creating and \ndecomposing supports all life on Earth. But there are a few environments too\nhostile for these multi-talented microbes— including the peat bogs \noutside Cheshire, England. Peat bogs are mostly made of highly\nacidic Sphagnum mosses. These plants acidify the soil\nwhile also releasing a compound that binds to nitrogen, \ndepriving the area of nutrients. Alongside cold \nnorthern European temperatures, these conditions make it impossible \nfor most microbes to function. With nothing to break them down, the dead mosses pile up, \npreventing oxygen from entering the bog. The result is a naturally sealed system. Whatever organic matter enters a peat bog\njust sits there— like the Lindow Man. The acid of the bog was strong enough to dissolve relatively simple material \nlike bone, and it turned more complex tissue \nlike skin and organs pitch black. But his corpse is otherwise \nso well-preserved, that we can determine \nhe was healthy, mid-20s, and potentially wealthy \nas his body shows few signs of hard labor. We even know the Lindow Man’s last meal— a still undigested piece of charred bread. Scholars are less certain about \nthe circumstances of his death. While cold-blooded murder\nis a possibility, the extremity of his injuries\nsuggest a ritual sacrifice. Even 2,000 years ago, there’s evidence the bog was known \nfor its almost supernatural qualities; a place where the soil beneath your feet \nwasn’t quite dead or alive."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Soil is home to what percentage of global biodiversity?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "75"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50"}, {"label": "C", "text": "25"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the name of the process where larger molecules are broken down into smaller molecules by soil organisms?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "mineralization"}, {"label": "B", "text": "immobilization"}, {"label": "C", "text": "nitrification"}, {"label": "D", "text": "carbonization"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which type of soil organism is most effective at decomposing woody material?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "fungi"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bacteria"}, {"label": "C", "text": "earthworms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "protozoa"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Peat bogs consist largely of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lichen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Irish moss"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sphagnum moss"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Liverworts"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Peat bogs are poor sites for decomposition due to which conditions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Low temperatures"}, {"label": "B", "text": "High acidity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lack of nitrogen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

The first to understand the situation are a handful of government \nand commercial operators. But well before they have time \nto process what’s happened, millions sitting on their couches become\naware that something is amiss. TV that’s broadcast from or routed \nthrough satellites dominate the market for international programming \nas well as some local channels, so the disappearance causes immediate\ndisruptions, worldwide. The next people affected are those\ntraveling by air, sea, or land, as global positioning, navigation \nand timing services, have entirely ceased. Pilots, captains, and drivers \nhave to determine their locations using analog instruments and maps. Aircraft, ships, and ground vehicles get \nstopped, grounded, or returned to port. In the meantime, air traffic controllers\nhave a difficult task on their hands to prevent plane crashes. Within hours, most of the planet’s traffic\ngrinds to a halt. The effects aren’t limited \nto entertainment and travel. All sorts of machines, from heating \nand cooling systems to assembly lines, rely on super-accurate \nsatellite-based timing systems, and many have little-to-no backup options. Stoplights and other traffic control\nsystems stop synchronizing, so police and good Samaritans \nstep in to direct the remaining cars and prevent as many accidents as possible. The most catastrophic impact \nis yet to come. Because in the next few hours, \nthe world economy shuts down. Satellite-based timestamps \nplay a critical part in everything from credit card readers \nand stock exchanges to the systems that keep track\nof transactions. People are unable to withdraw cash\nor make electronic payments. Logistics and supply chains for crucial\ngoods like food and medicine fragment, leaving people to survive on whatever\nis locally available. Most countries declare \na state of emergency and call on the military to restore order. That may take quite a while. Most navigation and communication systems\nare no longer operational, so military chains of command\nmay be in disarray. Many troops, including those actively\ndeployed, are left to their own devices. Commanders of nuclear submarines \nand missile control centers wonder if the disruption is the result\nof a hostile attack. What sorts of decisions do they make \nwith partial information? Even in the best-case scenario, our civilization gets set back by decades \nat the very least. That’s because, despite\nbeing a relatively new phenomenon, satellites have quickly replaced more\ntraditional long range technologies. The combination of global positioning\nand internet has allowed for near-instant signals \nthat can be synchronized worldwide. Many systems we use daily \nhave been built upon this foundation. Going back to the communication systems\nof the mid-20th century would not be a simple matter. In many cases, they’d have to be rebuilt\nfrom the ground up. While the sudden disappearance \nin this thought experiment is unlikely, there are two very real scenarios \nthat could lead to the same results. The first is a solar flare so strong\nit fries satellite circuitry– as well as many other devices \nand power grids around the world. And the second is an orbital chain\nreaction of collisions. With about 7,500 metric tons \nof defunct spacecraft, spent boosters, and discarded equipment \norbiting our planet at relative speeds \nup to 56,000 kilometers per hour, even small objects can be\nhighly destructive. A single collision in space could create\nthousands of new pieces of debris, leading to a chain reaction. Space is huge, but many of the thousands\nof satellites currently in orbit share the same orbital highways \nfor their specific purposes.

Formally or informally, human societies \nacross place and time have made rules \nto bind and dissolve couples. Inca couples, for example,\nstarted with a trial partnership, during which a man could send \nhis partner home. But once a marriage was formalized,\nthere was no getting out of it. Among the Inuit peoples, \ndivorce was discouraged, but either spouse could demand one. or they could exchange partners\nwith a different couple— as long as all four people agreed. The stakes of who can obtain a divorce,\nand why, have always been high. Divorce is a battlefield for some\nof society's most urgent issues, including the roles of church and state,\nindividual rights, and women’s rights. Religious authorities have often\nregulated marriage and divorce. Muslims in Africa, the Middle East, and\nAsia began using the Quran’s rules in the 7th century AD— generally, a husband can divorce his wife \nwithout cause or agreement, while a wife must secure her husband’s\nagreement to divorce him. In Europe, Christian churches controlled\ndivorce from the 11th century on, with the Catholic Church\nbanning it entirely and Protestant churches allowing\nit in restricted circumstances, particularly adultery. In the late 18th century,\na series of changes took place that would eventually shape \ndivorce laws around the world. Following centuries of religious conflict, Europeans pushed for state governance\nseparate from religious control. Secular courts gradually took over\neducation, welfare, health, marriage— and divorce. The French Revolution ushered in the first\nof the new divorce laws, allowing men and women to divorce \nfor a number of grounds, including adultery, violence, \nand desertion, or simply mutual consent. Though progress was uneven, overall this\nsort of legislation spread in Europe, North America and some European\ncolonies in the 19th century. Still, women's access to divorce often\nremained restricted compared to men. Adultery was considered more\nserious for women— a man could divorce his wife\nfor adultery alone, while a woman would need\nevidence of adultery, plus an additional offense\nto divorce her husband. Sometimes this double standard\nwas written into law; other times, the courts enforced\nthe laws unequally. Domestic violence by a man against \nhis wife was not widely considered grounds for divorce \nuntil the 20th century. And though new laws expanded \nthe reasons a couple could divorce, they also retained the fundamental\nideology of their religious predecessors: that a couple could only split if one\nperson wronged the other in specific ways. This state of affairs really overstayed\nits welcome. Well into the 20th century,\ncouples in the U.S. resorted to hiring actors to jump into bed\nwith one spouse, fully clothed, and take photos\nas evidence of cheating. Finally, in the 1960s and 70s, many countries and states adopted \nno-fault divorce laws, where someone could divorce their spouse \nwithout proving harm, and importantly, \nwithout the other’s consent. The transition from cultural \nand religious rules to state sanctioned ones \nhas always been messy and incomplete— people have often ignored\ntheir governments’ laws in favor of other conventions. Even today, the Catholic Church doesn’t \nrecognize divorces granted by law. In some places, like parts of India, Western-style divorce laws\nhave been seen as a colonial influence and communities practice divorce \naccording to other religious rules. In others, though the law may allow\nfor equal access to divorce, bias in the legal system, cultural stigma,\nor community pressures can make it far more difficult for certain\npeople, almost always women. And even in the places where women \naren’t disadvantaged by law or otherwise, social and economic conditions often make\ndivorce more difficult for women. In the United States, for example, women experience economic loss \nfar more than men after divorce. At its best, modern no-fault divorce\nallows people to leave marriages that make them unhappy. But dissolving a marriage \nis almost never as simple as sending two people their separate ways. What divorcing partners owe each other, and how they manage aspects \nof a once shared life remain emotionally and philosophically \ncomplex issues."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where were the first divorce laws written?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ancient Greece"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Europe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ancient Mesopotamia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ancient Rome"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When were the first divorce laws written?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Around 2000 BCE"}, {"label": "B", "text": "7th century AD"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In 1964"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In 1850"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Marriage and divorce were often regulated by", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Religious authorities"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Community leaders"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The court"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Family members"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Couples can divorce on the ground of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Adultery"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Violence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Desertion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mutual consent"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the Above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "True or false?

In every culture on Earth,\nas language developed, people learned to share their stories,\nhopes, and dreams. Imagine a typical scene: It's after nightfall, the campfire \nis ablaze, an elder rises, eyes lock \nonto the wise, wrinkled face, and as the storyteller speaks, each listener imagines the events\nthat are being described. What happens next is astounding: The brains inside the heads \nof independent individuals start to behave very strangely. They begin to sync up— they gasp together,\nlaugh together, weep together— and as they do so, something else happens. Rich neurologically encoded patterns \nof information inside the woman's brain are somehow copied and transferred \nto the brains in the audience. These patterns will remain in those brains\nfor the rest of their lives, potentially impacting their behavior \nyears into the future. Every meaningful element of human progress has happened only because humans \nhave shared ideas with each other and then collaborated to turn \nthose ideas into reality. From the first time our ancestors teamed\nup to take down a mammoth, to Neil Armstrong's first step\nonto the moon, people have turned spoken words \ninto astonishing shared achievements The same is true today—\nas a leader or as an advocate, public speaking is the key \nto unlocking empathy, stirring excitement, sharing knowledge and insights, \nand promoting a shared dream. Indeed the spoken word \nhas actually gained new powers. Our campfire is now the whole world. Thanks to the internet, a single talk can\nend up being seen by millions of people. Just as the printing press massively\namplified the power of authors, so the web is massively amplifying\nthe impact of speakers. What is more, we can enhance these skills in ways the ancients could\nnever have imagined: the ability to show right there\nin beautiful, high resolution, any image that a human \ncan photograph or imagine; the ability to weave in video and music; the ability to draw on research tools that\npresent the entire body of human knowledge to anyone in reach of a smart phone. Suddenly, an ancient art has global reach. We need that now more than ever. Ideas that could solve our toughest\nproblems often remain invisible because the brilliant people\ninside whose minds they reside lack the confidence or the know-how\nto share those ideas effectively. At a time when the right idea \npresented the right way can ripple across the world\nat the speed of light, there's huge benefit to figuring \nout how best to set it on its way, both for you, the speaker in waiting, and for the rest of us, who need to know\nwhat you have to say.

Somehow, small squid \nknown to live deep beneath the waves kept appearing on the roof of their boat. The crew was mystified— until they saw the squids soaring\nabove the sea for roughly 50 meters. On land, people could barely believe\nthe explorers. It seemed impossible that sea creatures\nwithout wings or bones could fly at all, let alone travel half the length \nof a football field. But over the next several decades,\nmore reports began to surface. Sailors described airborne squid keeping\npace with motor boats. Researchers reported captive squid\nescaping their tanks overnight. And as cameras became widespread,\nseafarers finally began capturing proof of these high-flying cephalopods. But how and why do \nthese marine creatures take to the sky? While only a few squid species \nhave been recorded taking flight, most squid are alike in the way \nthey traverse the ocean. The outside of a squid’s body is a massive\ntube of muscle called the mantle. Water enters that tube through small\nopenings around the squid’s head. Then, muscles clamp \nthese openings shut, and the squid forcefully pumps the water\nthrough the base of their body. In practice, this makes the mantle\na miniature jetpack, propelling squid through the water \nat 10 kilometers per hour. This process is also how squid breathe. Squid gills rest inside the mantle, and siphon oxygen from the water\nbeing pushed past them. With gills full of air \nand a mantle full of water, squid can outpace predators \nand pursue their prey. Or, in the case of some species, they can \nsmash through the ocean’s surface, and attempt an epic flight. Without the resistance of water, a squid’s acceleration \nis the same as a car going from zero to 100 kilometers \nper hour in just over a second. At speeds of 40 kilometers per hour, \nsquid quickly generate aerodynamic lift. But to stay in the air they’ll need\nsomething like wings. Fortunately, our soaring cephalopod\nhas a plan. Squid tentacles are \"muscular hydrostats,\"\nmeaning the tissue can be held firm by muscle tension. Splaying its tentacles \nin a rigid formation, the squid transforms them \ninto flexible wing-like structures that stabilise its flight. At the opposite end of its body, two fins\ntypically used for gentle swimming find new purpose as a second set of wings. And by folding these fins down, a squid can streamline itself\nand dip back into the ocean. There have been too few observations to establish what a squid’s \ntypical flight trajectory looks like. Based on their flying speed, \na 10 centimeter squid could hypothetically launch itself \nsix meters above the water. But from what scientists have seen,\nflying squid tend to glide low, keeping close to the surface. This trajectory allows squid to cover\nthe most horizontal distance possible over a typical several second flight. It also makes it easy to dive back \ninto the water for more fuel— or to make a quick escape \nfrom predatory birds. But why do squids fly at all? Leading theories suggest that flight\nis an escape behaviour, as flying squid generally seem \nto be fleeing a nearby predator or ship. Other researchers think their flight may be an energy-saving\nmigration strategy, because it takes less energy to move\nquickly through the air than through water. However, it’s also possible\nthat learning to fly may be a vital part\nof surviving adolescence. Young, smaller squid can potentially\nfly faster and farther than their larger relatives. And since adult squid tend \nto cannibalize juveniles, soaring above the surf can help ensure\nthese young squid will live to fly another day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How does a flying squid get airborne?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They ride surface waves into the air"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They pump water with their mantle to create jet thrust"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They flap their tentacles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Predatory birds carry them into the air"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How far does a squid travel in a flight?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50 m"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6 m"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10 km"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Until it tires out"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How much faster is a squid in air than in water?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Four times faster"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The same speed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ten times faster"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Twice as fast"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is a ‘muscular hydrostat’?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A muscle’s water content"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An appendage without skeletal support, such as a squid tentacle or human tongue."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A squid’s breathing organ"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An organ for sensing water depth"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why do squid fly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To escape danger"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To save energy during migration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To avoid cannibalism from adult squid"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Probably (a), but (b) and (c) are also possible"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Sitting alongside a riverbank, Cangjie\nnoticed the imagery that surrounded him. From this, he created\nthe first Chinese characters. And that night, the sky rained millet\nwhile ghosts cried, fearing their actions may now be\ncondemned by the written word. We can’t say for sure whether\nthe story is true. But the earliest artifacts containing\nChinese characters date to the Shang Dynasty,\naround 1250 to 1050 BCE, still making it one of the earliest\nforms of written language. Characters etched on ox bones\nand turtle shells show Shang kings’ writings\nto their ancestors, discussing everything from agriculture\nto the origins of a toothache. And as the legend suggests, these ancient characters\nwere mainly pictograms, or symbols that resemble\nwhat they’re meant to represent. Even today, some of the most foundational\nChinese characters remain pictographic, like rén (人), which means person,\nand mù (木), which means wood or tree. Some characters are ideograms, or\nsymbols that represent abstract concepts, like the numbers yī (一),\nèr (二), and sān (三). Others are compound ideograms, which combine two or more\npictograms or ideograms. For example, xiū (休) places\nthe character for person next to the character for tree\nand means to rest. However, most modern-day characters\nare known as logograms, and are constructed of two components:\na radical component, which gestures at the meaning\nof the character, and a sound component,\nwhich hints at its pronunciation. And all characters are built\nfrom a variety of strokes, which are often simplified\nto eight basic types. There are 214 radicals,\neach with its own definition. Some can stand alone, while others cannot. For instance, the radical rì (日),\nwritten on its own means sun. It’s also used in characters\nwith sun-related definitions, such as xiǎo (晓) meaning dawn. The radical cǎo (艹), on the other hand,\nnever stands alone, but can be found within characters related\nto grass and plants, like huā (花) meaning flower. And the radical shuǐ (水), meaning water,\nalways stands alone, but has a variant (氵) that is used when\nit’s part of more complex characters like hé (河), meaning river. Radicals can appear\nin different positions: to the left, to the right, above, below, or even surrounding the rest\nof the character. There are many more sound components\nthan radicals, with estimates ranging in the thousands. Similar sounding words often share\nthe same sound component, and their radicals help shed light\non their meanings. Take fēng (峰) and fēng (蜂). The radical shān (山) means mountain, which hints at the first\ncharacter’s definition: summit. The radical in the second character,\nchóng (虫), means insect, and together with the sound component\nmeans bee. While many words in Chinese sound similar,\njust like in other languages, context or tonality helps\nclarify their meaning. Yet how each character is pronounced\ndepends on dialect, which varies across the country. So conversations in Chengdu may sound\nvastly different than in Nanjing, but in both places,\nthe written language is the same. And unlike the romance languages, Chinese has no gendered nouns\nor verb conjugations. So the character chī (吃), meaning to eat,\nremains unchanged whether the subject is yourself,\na coworker, or a lesion of fearful ghosts. To indicate the past, a marker\nlike le (了) can be added. So “I eat bread” becomes “I ate bread.” Over the years, the Chinese writing\nsystem has undergone many changes. As characters went from being\netched in bone, to cast in bronze, to brushed on paper, their script has evolved along the way. In the 1950s and 60s,\nthe Chinese Communist Party introduced new simplified versions\nof the traditional characters, which are now standard in China, though traditional characters remain\nin use in Hong Kong and Taiwan. And while the Chinese character\nsystem may seem unique, its development greatly influenced\nthe spoken languages and writing systems of its neighbors. For example, around 60% of Japanese\ndictionary entries are kanji— characters that originated in Chinese\nor were created from its elements. With a 3,000 year history, Chinese characters have and will\ncontinue to leave their mark."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The earliest artifacts containing Chinese characters date from which dynasty?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shang"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tang"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Yuan"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Han"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Most Chinese characters are ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pictographs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Letters"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Logograms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Consonant clusters"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A radical hints at a character’s ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pronunciation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Etymology"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Grammatical function"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Meaning"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following grammatical features does Chinese have?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gendered nouns"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Particles denoting the time when an action occurred"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Conjugation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gender agreement between nouns and adjectives"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to the video, which of the following regions today utilizes the simplified writing system, as opposed to the traditional one?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hong Kong"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Taiwan"}, {"label": "C", "text": "American Chinatowns"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mainland China"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

When Oedipus’ mother,\nQueen Jocasta of Thebes, gave birth to him,\na grim heir seized the occasion. Her husband, King Laius, had received\na prophecy from Apollo’s oracle foretelling that he would die\nat the hands of his own son. Determined to escape this fate,\nLaius had the newborn’s ankles pierced, and Jocasta ordered a shepherd to abandon\nhim on Mount Cithaeron to perish. But divine prophecies\ncan be quite stubborn. The shepherd took pity on the baby\nand gave him to to another shepherd— this one from Corinth. He decided to bring the baby to the\nchildless Corinthian king and queen, Polybus and Merope. They called the boy Oedipus,\nor “swollen-foot,” and raised him as their own,\nnever revealing his true origin. Years passed, till one night, a drunken reveler told Oedipus that he was\nnot Polybus and Merope’s son by birth— an allegation they staunchly denied. But the seeds of doubt burrowed\ninto Oedipus’ mind. He left to seek counsel\nfrom Apollo’s oracle at Delphi, who instead delivered\na deeply disturbing prophecy: Oedipus would murder his father\nand have children with his mother. Horrified, Oedipus determined\nto stay far from Corinth and the only parents he’d ever known. He ventured towards Thebes—\nand thus, unwittingly, towards the city where his\nbirth parents reigned. At a crossroads on the way, a fancy carriage threatened to run\nOedipus off the road, and a lethal fight ensued. Little did Oedipus know, one of the\ncasualties was King Laius of Thebes, his own birth father. In killing him, Oedipus had fulfilled\nthe first half of Apollo’s prophecy. When Oedipus reached the gates of Thebes,\nhe was met by the treacherous Sphinx. She’d ravaged the city, posing a bewildering riddle\nto those she encountered and mercilessly devouring\nall who answered incorrectly. But when she fixed her keen,\nexpectant gaze on Oedipus, he gave the correct response. Thebes celebrated the Sphinx's defeat, and Oedipus married the city's recently\nwidowed queen, Jocasta. They had four children, neither realizing\nthey were, in fact, mother and son— or that they’d completed the second half\nof Apollo’s prophecy. Eventually, a devastating plague\ndescended on Thebes. To save the city, Oedipus sent his\nbrother-in-law to consult Apollo’s oracle. She declared that the divine plague\nwould only relent if the killer of Thebes’\nprevious king, Laius, was finally revealed,\nthen driven out or avenged with blood. Oedipus hastily opened an investigation. He interrogated Tiresias, a blind prophet, who stayed silent before suggesting\nthat Oedipus himself was the killer. Oedipus denied and deflected\nthe accusation. But it stuck with him. Jocasta likewise insisted that Laius’\nkiller couldn’t have been Oedipus, for she'd heard that Laius was killed\nat a crossroads by robbers. Yet, through conversations with a\nmessenger from Corinth and, finally, the shepherd who’d rescued him\nas an infant, the truth came bearing down upon Oedipus. In searching for Laius’ murderer,\nhe’d been looking for himself, and Apollo’s prophecy had come to pass,\nin all its dreadful detail. Full of fury, resentment, and shame,\nOedipus rushed to kill Jocasta— but she too had realized the truth\nand taken her own life. Using brooches from her dress,\nOedipus blinded himself in anguish, expunging his deceitful sense of sight, which had kept him\nfrom truly seeing so much. Oedipus begged for exile, but was led back into the castle\nto await word from Apollo’s oracle. Thus ends Sophocles’ first play\ncentering Oedipus. But it wouldn’t be his final word\non the tragic hero. Decades later, a roughly 89-year-old\nSophocles wrote its sequel, set in Colonus, his own birthplace. It finds Oedipus, now aged and exiled, confronted with accusations\nof incest and patricide. Oedipus, having accepted the truth\nand released himself from its shame, proclaims his innocence and maintains\nthat he committed these deeds unwittingly— and unwillingly. Finally, Oedipus knows it’s time to go—\nand a divine voice urges him on.

Beyond wanting to share a picture of me\nas an adorable child or reminisce on my youth gone by, all this talk about seeing\nreminds me of a very widely known but misunderstood concept: empathy. See, I've been studying empathy\nfor the last 15 years. And at its core, empathy\nis how we see plus what we see. How we see is rooted\nin our personal experience. It's subjective. What we see is more objective. It is a physical observation\nof a moment, a circumstance, a condition that invites us\nto act in some particular way. How we see, on the contrary, is more rooted in our personal beliefs\nand our value system, and perhaps our technical knowledge, all of which may vary\nfrom person to person.

Anyway, I remember my first\nsemester of graduate school taking a class and reading a paper called \"The Political is Personal\"\nby Eileen O'Brien. In the paper, O'Brien describes\nwhite anti-racists who have a really difficult time\nbuilding relationships with the people of color\nthat they aim to help. O'Brien insists that white folks\nand people of color in the United States are separated\nby this wide perception gap. So white folks sort of think\nabout racism as ending in 1960s and therefore see people of color\nas complaining and overreacting. But people of color see\ncontinued racial discrimination. O'Brien is helping the reader to notice\na fundamental divergence in perspective that she describes as false empathy, borrowing from heralded legal\nscholar Richard Delgado. Essentially, false empathy\nis the failure of the empathizer to see eye-to-eye with the individual\nfor whom they aim to empathize. These white anti-racists really\nthought of themselves as more empathetic than they really were. In fact, the people of color\nthey aimed to help did not receive their benevolence\nand charity as help at all. And in turn, these white anti-racists\ndeveloped feelings of discontent and frustration that O'Brien then describes\nas evidence of their false empathy. Now, I remember reading\nthat paper and thinking a lot about my white colleagues\nwho I taught with at the time in Chicago. According to the National Center\nfor Education Statistics, white folks make up about 80 percent\nof the teacher workforce, while US student populations\nbecome increasingly diverse. Less than 50 percent of all K-12 students\nare being identified as white. This really made me wonder if empathy,\nor perhaps false empathy, could explain why my colleagues\nhad such a difficult time building positive, substantive relationships\nwith their Black students. I watched as Black boys, who needed more patience and more care, be mislabeled as disengaged\nand disinterested learners. Now a young person who refuses\nto take off their headphones, that's what we see. Making sense of the reasons why is how we see. We need both to drive what we do, because empathy is best\nexpressed in the doing. Like the white anti-racist\nin the O'Brien study, these teachers relationships\ntended to be fragile at best, and too often nonexistent with a group of kids who desperately\nneeded positive adult interactions. Now, I’m talking about education. But all of us, no matter\nwhat your industry, on a quest to become a good\nand kind human being, must stop to notice if false empathy\nis driving our interactions with diverse others. OK, so I have to give you a few examples. False empathy is thinking you know more\nabout other people's problems than they do. It’s like meeting somebody\nfrom Flint, Michigan and saying, \"Oh my God, I know what it's like\nnot to have something you need\" when you've never been\nwithout clean water. Not having something you need is not exactly the same thing\nas not having clean water. False empathy is like putting on\nyour superhero cape. We see somebody in pain,\nwe rush into action, shrouded in the spectacle of it all, without ever stopping to query\nthe source of their distress. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but sometimes saving them may be more about you\nthan it is about them. And false empathy is egotistical. It is self-centered. I love crab legs. (Laughter) Can I just be honest? I love seafood. But false empathy is thinking\nI'm doing a really good thing by going to my favorite restaurant and getting a pound of juicy crab legs to take to a partner\nwho has a shellfish allergy. Or buying an expensive gift for a child who would much rather have your attention\non the couch after a long day. I could go on, but what I'm trying to say is that false empathy represents\na conflict in perspective, and an earnest intention at anti-racism and helping others does not guarantee that your action\nwill lead to the intended outcome, or that we will achieve the relationships that we all need to thrive. I've learned in my research with teachers who demonstrate evidence\nof empathy with Black boys that they don't wake up\nevery day aiming to be empathetic. They try things, they fail,\nand they make mistakes. They exercise humility\nand they try something else. Some researchers might refer\nto that as perspective taking, which is the ability\nto spontaneously adopt the psychological point of view of others. So we know that perspective taking substantially improves\nstudent-teacher relationships. That Black boys,\nwho are otherwise cast aside, feel seen and heard in classrooms where there is evidence\nof perspective taking, in part because their teachers\ntake a lot of care to develop innovative and proactive\nsolutions to their problems. We know that perspective taking can reduce instances\nof exclusionary discipline, which is an issue that is particularly\nsalient for Black kids. And we know that empathy training\ncan reduce implicit bias. So imagine for a second you come across someone\nwho appears to be sad and you want to offer them some support, or you have a friend\nwho approaches you for advice on an issue for which\nyou have some familiarity. If you want to avoid false empathy,\nperhaps you start by stopping. Stop to observe the moment, right? Empathy requires heightened\nsensitivity to our ego. We all have an ego. We just don't want that ego\nover determining how we see. So we have to learn to decenter\nourselves as we listen. Listening is an art. It's a discipline, but it's also\nan act of perspective taking. We listen so that we can ask\nmeaningful questions, engage in discourse, exercise humility and simply be present. We cannot do empathy\nwithout perspective taking. And finally, we have to do something. We have to act. But we should not expect\nthat just because we acted that it's going to be the right thing. The feedback we get from that action should drive our subsequent interactions. On the journey to understanding\nand interpretation, it's a lot like our natural eyes. It grows with time. As I grow older, my eyes evolve. That's what we'll call it. They evolve. And so I have to go,\nand I have to see the optometrist, and I sit in front of that contraption as they move the different lenses\nto check the clarity of my sight. They're doing that\nbecause they want to make sure that how and what I see helps me to act in a way that will make\nthe world a better place as I move through it. Empathy is a lot like that prescription. So the next time you want to help, you want to heal, you want to support\nor simply show up for someone, try to make sure you're seeing\nwith the right eyes. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Until you read an advertisement: “See the Dunk-O-Matic face human players\nand automatically adjust its skill to create a fair game for every opponent!” That's not what you were told to create. You designed a robot that shoots baskets, sometimes successfully and sometimes not,\ntaking turns with a human opponent. No one said anything about teaching it\nto adjust its performance. Maybe the CEO skimmed an article\nabout AI and overpromised, setting you up for public embarrassment. Luckily, you installed a feature\nwhere given any probability q, you can adjust the robot to have that\nprobability of success on each attempt. You swiftly gather information,\nand jackpot: your team has a dossier on all\npotential demo participants, including the probability each has\nof making baskets. In each match, the human shoots first,\nthen the robot, then the human again, and so on until someone makes\nthe first successful basket and wins. You can remotely adjust the Dunk-O-Matic’s\nprobability between opponents. What should that probability\nbe for each opponent, so that the human has a 50% chance\nof winning each match? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You might guess that q\nshould be equal to p. But that ignores the advantage\nof going first. Suppose p and q are both 100%. Even though the competitors\nare equally skilled, the first player always wins. So a deeper analysis is required. One approach involves adding up every\nchance the human has to win, using geometric series. A geometric series is an infinite\nsum of numbers, where each number is the previous number\nmultiplied by a common ratio. Two facts about geometric series\nare useful here. First, if the common ratio r\nof a geometric series has absolute value less than 1, the series has a finite total. And second, if the first number\nin the series is a, that total is: a divided by 1-minus-r. How does this help us calibrate our robot? Remember that the human has probability p\nof making a basket. Since they go first, they have probability\np of winning on the first try. What’s the probability that they win\non the second try? That attempt only happens\nif both players miss. The probability of a miss is 1 minus\nthe probability of a success, so the miss probabilities are\n1-minus-p and 1-minus-q. The chance of both happening\nis the product of those values. So the probability of two failures\nand then a human success is p times (1-minus-p) times (1-minus-q). Winning on the third try requires\nanother round of misses, so that chance is p multiplied\nby the double-miss probability twice. If we add all the possible probabilities\nof a human win, the total is the sum\nof a geometric series. Since the first number in the series is p, and the ratio is this product\nthat’s less than 1, the sum will be\n(p divided by 1) minus the ratio. We want this sum to be 1/2. Using some algebra to solve for q, we find that q should equal p\ndivided by 1-minus-p. If p is greater than 50%,\nq would need to be bigger than 1, which can’t happen. In that case, a fair game is impossible, because the human has a better-than-50%\nchance of winning immediately. The robot's total probability is also\nthe total of a geometric series. How does this series compare\nto the human’s? To win, the robot needs some number\nof double misses, then a human failure\nfollowed by a robot success. If q equals p over 1-minus-p, (1-minus-p) times q is p. For our choice of q, not only do these\nseries have the same sum, but they’re the same series! We could bypass geometric series\nby starting with this reasoning. The robot’s chances of winning in the\nfirst round is (1-minus-p) times q, and so if we want that chance to match\nthe human’s first-round chance, we want it to equal p,\nmaking q: p over 1-minus-p. More rounds may occur,\nbut before each round, the competitors are tied,\nso everything effectively restarts. If they have the same odds of winning\nin the first round, they also will in the second round,\nand so on. The demonstration goes perfectly, but while you didn't want\nto embarrass yourself, you also didn’t want\nto deceive the public. Taking the stage, you explain\nyour company’s false promises and your hastily ad-libbed solution. Thankfully, the ensuing bad press\nis directed at your employers, and it turns out the\npresentation volunteers own a more employee-friendly\nrobotics company.

However, other species\nhave extraordinary adaptations that grant them access\nto realms of sonic extremes. And some of them don’t even have ears—\nat least, not like we typically imagine. To understand how the animal kingdom’s\nbest listeners do it, we need to know the rules of their game. When an object in a medium\nlike air or water moves, it sends out physical waves. The basics of hearing involve structures\nthat vibrate in response to these waves and excite sensory cells, generating signals that nerves transmit\nto the brain, where they’re processed. But despite the assemblage\nof sound-absorbing and -amplifying structures in our ears, many noises are too quiet\nfor us to detect. Owls, however, have some workarounds. Our external ears funnel sounds inward— but many owls use their whole faces\nto do this. Their ears,\nhidden beneath a flap of feathers, have eardrums proportionally much larger\nand more sensitive than humans’. And because many owls ears\nare positioned asymmetrically, sound waves reach them at different times. This slight delay helps their brains\ndetermine the direction of the sound’s source. And great grey owl wings have\nespecially thick velvety coatings and long feather combs and fringes, which are thought to help reduce\ntheir flight sounds. So, while hovering,\nthey can go undetected and concentrate on the subtle sounds\nof their prey. All these adaptations enable\na great grey owl to hear a vole tunneling under 18 inches of snow— and make a fatal strike. Other animals are almost all ears, like the aptly named long-eared jerboa, which is the animal kingdom’s largest ears\nin proportion to body length. These sizable sound-collectors help\nthe jerboas sense low frequency noises— and keep cool by radiating heat. Fennec foxes use\ntheir large, swiveling ears to rapidly home in on activity\nbeneath Sahara sands, while bat-eared foxes can\npick up savanna sounds as slight as termites crawling\nand munching on grasses. Ogre-faced spiders, meanwhile, might not have ears in the traditional\nvertebrate sense, but their legs are covered by receptors\nsensitive to sound waves as soft as those generated\nby mosquito flight. This allows them to catch airborne prey— even after being blindfolded\nby scientists. Lots of different features also help\nanimal ears hit especially high notes, like the extra hard, stiff middle ear\nbones of toothed whales; like dolphins and sperm whales, which efficiently propagate\nhigh-frequency vibrations. Indeed, some toothed whales and bats\nemit sound pulses around 200,000 hertz and listen for the reflections. These high-frequency wavelengths— more than 10 times higher\nthan what we can hear— are small enough to generate\nstrong reflections from objects as tiny as the insects\nmany bats are after, which would be missed altogether\nby lower ones. But many insects are also\nin on the conversation— and vigilant to ultrasonic onslaughts. The greater wax moth can register\nthe highest frequencies of any animal recorded—\nup to 300,000 hertz, thanks to thin, vibration-sensitive,\neardrum-like membranes on their abdomens. In fact, hearing organs have\nevolved independently more than 20 times among insects. Katydids sense ultrasonic sounds\nwith their front legs; certain hawkmoths can hear\nwith their mouthparts; a parasitic fly registers cricket chirps\nfrom organs behind its head; and the praying mantis has just one\nhearing organ, which sits smack in the midline\nof its thorax. But how low can animals go? Well, baleen whales emit sounds\naround 14 hertz, the deepest among mammals. These vibrations can travel\nthousands of kilometers. And they get picked up by other\nbaleen whales— possibly via their skulls, which conduct the vibrations\nalong to their ear bones. Snakes pick up ground vibrations\nby way of their jawbones, which connect directly\nto their middle ear bones. And Namib Desert golden moles regularly\nstick their heads into the sand, which likely helps them use their large,\nclub-like middle ear bones to sense low frequency activity\nin mounds more than 20 meters away. So, odds are: if a tree falls in a forest,\nsomeone’s bound to hear it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which animals can hear the highest-frequency sounds (up to 300000 Hz)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bats "}, {"label": "B", "text": "Toothed whales"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Wax moths"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Barn owls"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Golden moles"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What are the highest frequencies any human can normally hear?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "200000 Hz"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100000 Hz"}, {"label": "C", "text": "50000 Hz"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20000 Hz"}, {"label": "E", "text": "10000 Hz"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How many times have insects evolved hearing organs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50 times"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100 times"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10 times"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Once only"}, {"label": "E", "text": "20 times"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What is special about toothed whales and bats?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Both can hear higher frequencies than humans."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Both use reflections of their high-frequency sounds to find prey."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both have evolved their sense of hearing independently of other mammals."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both have lost their sense of vision."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which statement is true about the hearing of grey owls and barn owls?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They can hear higher frequencies than humans."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They have large external ears."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Their ears are positioned asymmetrically, and this helps them to locate sounds of their prey."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Their facial disk is used to radiate heat."}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 112, "lesson": 24, "title": "The meaning of love, according to Rumi - Stephanie Honchell Smith", "category": "Philosophy & Religion", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-meaning-of-love-according-to-rumi-stephanie-honchell-smith", "transcript": {"en": "“A candle is made to become\nentirely flame. In that annihilating moment\nit has no shadow.” According to legend, the renowned scholar,\nJalaluddin Muhammad Rumi, was giving a lecture when an older,\ndisheveled man approached and asked him the meaning\nof his academic books. Rumi didn’t know it yet,\nbut this question and this man would change his life. Annoyed at the interruption, Rumi snapped, “They are something that\nyou do not understand!” Suddenly, the books caught fire. The man looked back at the astounded Rumi\nand simply replied: “You couldn’t possibly understand.” The mysterious figure was Shams of Tabriz, a charismatic Sufi mystic who would\ntransform Rumi's worldview. Rumi, inspired by Shams’ teachings, would go on to become one of the world’s\nmost celebrated poets and mystical philosophers, whose cultural legacy looms large across\nTürkiye and the Persian-speaking world. Rumi was born in 1207\nnear the Afghan city of Balkh, and as a child emigrated to Anatolia,\nwhere his father— a preacher and mystic— hoped to secure a more\nprestigious position. By the time of Shams’ arrival, Rumi was a well-respected scholar\nof Islamic law in the town of Konya. While he had been exposed to Sufism— the mystical path within Islam,\nwhich focuses on experiencing God’s love— he’d shown little interest in it. But this changed in his late thirties,\nwhen Shams came into his life. The academic study of law and theology\nwas no longer Rumi's central focus. Rather, he saw them as candles guiding\nthe way towards his ultimate goal: the reunification of his soul with God\nthrough the experience of divine love. He wrote of this tension\nin his native Persian, “Love resides not in learning,\nnot in knowledge, not in pages and books. Wherever the debates of men may lead,\nthat is not the lover’s path.” While Sufism had been part\nof Islamic observance for centuries, the practices of some Sufis—\nfrom ecstatic dancing to composing poetry— were looked down upon by conservative\nreligious elites. As Rumi increasingly embraced Sufism\nunder Shams’ influence, many of his earlier followers disapproved. When Shams suddenly disappeared,\nsuspicions arose that he'd been murdered. Rumi expressed his devastation\nthrough poetry: “He bathed us like a candle in his light;\nin thin air vanished, left us!” Rather than turning away from Sufism,\nRumi became more devoted, participating in ritualized dancing\nand preaching the religion of love through lectures, poetry, and prose. And while Shams would never return,\nRumi continued to share his teachings, seeing himself as the moon\nreflecting the light of Shams’ sun. While in his mystical states,\nhe composed the “Divan-i-Shams,” a sprawling collection of lyrical poems that included many of the sayings\nfor which he is famous today. The work expresses intense feelings\nof love and longing, not only for his vanished mentor,\nbut for the divine creator. Over time, Rumi's poetry matured. He no longer saw himself\nas a reflection of Shams, but as a beacon of light on his own. In his early fifties,\nRumi wrote “Masnavi,” which shifts from ecstatic expressions\nof divine love to verses that guide others\nto discover it for themselves. The poems are complex and layered, incorporating ideas, stories, and quotes\nfrom Islamic religious texts, Arabic and Persian literature,\nand earlier Sufi writings and poetry. In one story, he invokes the well-known\ncharacters of Layla and the love-crazed Majnun. In Rumi’s version, the king, hearing Majnun’s musings\non Layla’s unsurpassed beauty, demands to see her. But when Layla arrives, he’s confused, as her beauty pales in comparison\nto Majnun's praises. To this, Layla replies, “I am Layla.\nThe problem is you are not Majnun.” For Rumi, experiencing love meant opening\nhis heart to all of God’s creation— looking at everything and everyone\nlike Majnun gazing upon Layla. In this way, he saw romantic love\nas an expression— on a smaller scale— of divine love. Following Rumi’s death, the Mevlevi Sufi\norder was established around his teachings and still exists in Türkiye today. His poems and other writings were copied\nand dispersed across the Islamic world, inspiring and shaping Persian poetry, before being introduced to the West\nin the 19th century. For generations, his works have been\nread and reread, translated and reinterpreted,\ndrawing admirers from around the world. While Rumi's words reflect his specific\nhistorical context and Islamic worldview, for many, his message feels universal: “If you have lost heart\nin the Path of Love, flee to me without delay: I am a fortress invincible.”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where was Rumi originally from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "North Africa"}, {"label": "C", "text": "India"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Central Asia"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What was Rumi’s religion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Islam"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Judaism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hinduism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Christianity"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Who was Rumi’s spiritual mentor?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Farid al-Din ‘Attar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Shams of Tabriz"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rabia of Basra"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Omar Khayyam"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In what language did Rumi write his poetry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Arabic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Turkish"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Persian"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Catalan"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the primary focus of Rumi’s poetry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Love"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Paradise"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Redemption"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Islamic law"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
