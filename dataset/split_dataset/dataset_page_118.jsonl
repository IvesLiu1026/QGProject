Groups of young plaintiffs,\nsome as young as 7, are suing their governments for their\ninaction on tackling climate change. For example, in the winter of 2018, 25 young Colombians,\nincluding Indigenous youths, sued their government for failing\nto reduce deforestation in the Amazon and falling short on climate promises. This suit, as well as others, argued that destructive\nenvironmental policies put the plaintiffs’ current and future\nlives at risk. Climate inaction violates\ntheir basic human rights— specifically the right to a healthy\nenvironment, health, food, and water. But what do human rights\nhave to do with the environment? Do you have the right\nto breathe clean air? To live in a world with white rhinos,\npolar bears, and lemur leaf frogs? What about the right to mangroves\nand coral reefs? The first international document\nto outline human rights was adopted by the newly-formed\nUnited Nations in 1948, against the backdrop of two world wars\nmarked by countless atrocities and barbaric acts. This document, known as\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or UDHR, describes the inherent freedoms\nthat belong to all people, no matter who they are or where they live,\nand which can't be granted or revoked. It establishes rights\nlike freedom of thought, political liberties\nlike the right to a fair trial, and socioeconomic and cultural rights, like the right to adequate housing\nand healthcare. While the UDHR itself is non-binding, its formation gave people an\ninternationally recognized set of ethics and standards, and laid the foundation\nfor human rights law. And since 1948, these liberties have been\nwoven into international treaties, constitutions, and laws, meaning that countries have opted\nto uphold and protect them. As a result, countless individual\nhuman rights struggles and movements have been granted legitimacy\nand a legal basis for pursuing justice. The UDHR makes no mention\nof nature, biodiversity, or climate. These rights, instead, first took hold\nat the national level. Many countries within the Global South, often influenced by Indigenous laws\nand worldviews, incorporated the right to a healthy\nenvironment into their constitutions and regional treaties. Soon, human rights advocates were calling\non the rest of the world and the United Nations to recognize\nthis right as well. Many argued that the very principles\nof the UDHR depend on access to healthy ecosystems. Each year, millions of people die\nfrom air and water pollution. Declining pollinator populations\nthreaten basic food security. And the loss of coastal habitats has left\nmillions exposed to greater risks from destructive floods and hurricanes. Protecting this right is more urgent\nnow than ever before. Climate change is causing\nmore frequent heatwaves, longer droughts, and more destructive wildfires. Without rapid and significant change,\nthe planet is at risk of mass extinction, which could wipe out a quarter\nof the world’s biodiversity by 2100. Such losses to natural ecosystems would\nlikely have disastrous knockoff effects, further threatening food supplies,\ndestroying livelihoods, and leaving humanity\nmore vulnerable to disease. Thankfully, momentum is building. Today, over 150 countries\nand jurisdictions have enshrined the right to a healthy\nenvironment into national legislation. On April 5th, 2018, the Colombian Supreme Court\nruled in favor of the young plaintiffs, finding that the government was\nlegally obliged to reduce deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions in order to protect the rights\nof present and future generations. This case and similar historic wins\nby young people in the courts of the Netherlands,\nGermany, and the US has inspired others to take up the cause. As of the summer of 2023, a wave of more than 2,000\nhuman rights-based environmental cases have been filed across the globe. And this number is likely to grow. In 2022, an overwhelming majority of\nUN General Assembly states came together to keep human rights aligned\nto a changing world by recognizing the right to a clean,\nhealthy, and sustainable environment. It will take unprecedented\nglobal cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\nstop deforestation, and keep our waterways clean. These court cases are a powerful first\nstep to hold governments accountable and to give future generations\na better chance to breathe clean air, and live in a world with white rhinos,\npolar bears, and coral reefs for years to come."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the central argument plaintiffs are using against the governments they are suing for their inaction on climate change?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Destructive environmental policies are detrimental to the economy."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Destructive environmental policies are putting current and future lives at risk."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Destructive environmental policies breed fascism."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Destructive environmental policies increase housing prices."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A lapsed document that established global environmental policies."}, {"label": "B", "text": "A declaration of intention to reduce global poverty."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A document that describes the inherent freedoms that belong to all people."}, {"label": "D", "text": "A treaty that bans extreme interrogation tactics."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Since the UDHR was crafted in 1948, countries have chosen to uphold the liberties they outline by ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Weaving them into international treaties"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Incorporating them in national constitutions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Writing them into law"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What argument supports the belief that climate issues should considered part of the UDHR?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Animals should have the same rights as humans."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The principles of the UDHR depend on access to healthy ecosystems."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Access to beautiful green spaces should be a human right."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Living in polluted areas causes mental anguish.
