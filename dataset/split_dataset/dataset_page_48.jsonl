Specifically, they had opposing ideas\nof how speech and memory operated within the human brain. Ernest Aubertin, \nwith his localistic model, argued that a particular region\nor the brain was devoted to each separate process. Pierre Gratiolet, on the other hand,\nargued for the distributed model, where different regions work together to accomplish all of these \nvarious functions. The debate they began reverberated\nthroughout the rest of the century, involving some of the greatest scientific\nminds of the time. Aubertin and his localistic model\nhad some big names on his side. In the 17th century, Ren√© Descartes\nhad assigned the quality of free will and the human soul\nto the pineal gland. And in the late 18th century, a young\nstudent named Franz Joseph Gall had observed that the best memorizers\nin his class had the most prominent eyes and decided that this was due \nto higher development in the adjacent part of the brain. As a physician, Gall went on to establish\nthe study of phrenology, which held that strong mental faculties\ncorresponded to highly developed brain regions, observable\nas bumps in the skull. The widespread popularity of phrenology\nthroughout the early 19th century tipped the scales towards \nAubertin's localism. But the problem was that Gall had never\nbothered to scientifically test whether the individual brain maps\nhe had constructed applied to all people. And in the 1840's, Pierre Flourens\nchallenged phrenology by selectively destroying parts\nof animal brains and observing which functions were lost. Flourens found that damaging the cortex interfered with judgement or movement\nin general, but failed to identify any region\nassociated with one specific function, concluding that the cortex carried out\nbrain functions as an entire unit. Flourens had scored a victory \nfor Gratiolet, but it was not to last. Gall's former student, \nJean-Baptiste Bouillaud, challenged Flourens' conclusion, observing that patients \nwith speech disorders all had damage to the frontal lobe. And after Paul Broca's 1861 autopsy of a\npatient who had lost the power to produce speech, but not the power\nto understand it, revealed highly localized \nfrontal lobe damage, the distributed model seemed doomed. Localism took off. In the 1870's, Karl Wernicke associated\npart of the left temporal lobe with speech comprehension. Soon after, Eduard Hitzig and \nGustav Fritsch stimulated a dog's cortex and discovered\na frontal lobe region responsible for muscular movements. Building on their work, David Ferrier\nmapped each piece of cortex associated with moving a part of the body. And in 1909, Korbinian Brodmann built\nhis own cortex map with 52 separate areas. It appeared that the victory of Aubertin's\nlocalistic model was sealed. But neurologist Karl Wernicke had come up\nwith an interesting idea. He reasoned that since the regions for\nspeech production and comprehension were not adjacent, then injuring the area \nconnecting them might result in a special type of language loss,\nnow known as receptive aphasia. Wernicke's connectionist model helped\nexplain disorders that didn't result from the dysfunction \nof just one area. Modern neuroscience tools reveal a brain\nmore complex than Gratiolet, Aubertin,\nor even Wernicke imagined. Today, the hippocampus is associated\nwith two distinct brain functions: creating memories and processing\nlocation in space. We also now measure \ntwo kinds of connectivity: anatomical connectivity between \ntwo adjoining regions of cortex working together, and functional connectivity \nbetween separated regions working together to\naccomplish one process. A seemingly basic function like vision is actually composed \nof many smaller functions, with different parts \nof the cortex representing shape, color and location in space. When certain areas stop functioning,\nwe may recognize an object, but not see it, or vice versa. There are even different kinds of memory\nfor facts and for routines. And remembering something \nlike your first bicycle involves a network of different regions\neach representing the concept of vehicles, the bicycle's shape, \nthe sound of the bell, and the emotions associated \nwith that memory. In the end, both Gratiolet and Aubertin\nturned out to be right. And we still use both of their models\nto understand how cognition happens. For example, we can now measure brain\nactivity on such a fine time scale that we can see the individual localized\nprocesses that comprise a single act of remembering. But it is the integration of these\ndifferent processes and regions that creates the coherent memory\nwe experience. The supposedly competing theories\nprove to be two aspects of a more comprehensive model, which will in turn be revised and refined as our scientific techologies and methods\nfor understanding the brain improve."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When Broca and Bouillaud found brain damage in patients with speech disorders, where was that damage located?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Parietal lobe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Right hemisphere"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Frontal lobe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The hippocampus"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Gall's once popular method of measuring bumps on the skull to determine a person's strongest and weakest brain functions is called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Phrenology"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Autism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Localism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Connectivism"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A model mapping one brain function to one brain area is referred to as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Connectivist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Localistic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Distributed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Integrated"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Two types of connectivity--when areas of the brain work together--have been measured by modern neuroscientific methods.

Childhood injuries are things\nwe'd often like to forget, but our bodies often carry the memories\nin the form of scars. So what are these unwanted souvenirs\nand why do we keep them for so long after that unintended vacation\nto the emergency room? The most common place we see scars\nare on our skin, a patch that looks slightly different\nfrom the normal skin around it. Often, this is considered\nan unfortunate disfigurement, while other times, deliberate\nscarification has been used in both traditional and modern cultures,\nto mark a rite of passage or simply for aesthetic decoration. But the difference isn't only cosmetic. When we look at healthy skin tissue\nunder a microscope, we see the cells that perform\nvarious functions connected by an extracellular\nmatrix, or ECM. This is composed of structural proteins,\nlike collagen, secreted by specialized fibroblast cells. Well-arranged ECM allows for\ntransportation of nutrients, cell-to-cell communication,\nand cell adhesion. But when a deep wound occurs,\nthis arrangement is disrupted. During the process of wound healing,\ncollagen is redeposited at the wound site, but instead of the basket-weave formation\nfound in healthy tissue, the new ECM is aligned\nin a single direction, impeding inter-cell processes,\nand reducing durability and elasticity. To make matters worse, the healed tissue contains\na higher proportion of ECM than before, reducing its overall function. In the skin, the overabundance of collagen\ninterferes with its original functions, like producing sweat, controlling body temperature and even growing hair. The scar tissue is fragile, sensitive\nto changes in temperature and sensation, and should be kept in moist environments\nto maximize healing. This presence of excessive\nfibrous connective tissue in an organ is known as fibrosis,\nand if that term sounds familiar, it's because our skin is not the only\norgan vulnerable to scarring. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder\nthat causes scarring of the pancreas, while pulmonary fibrosis\nis a scarring of the lungs, resulting in shortness of breath. Scarring of the heart and the buildup\nof ECM following a heart attack can inhibit its beating,\nleading to further heart problems. What's common to all these conditions is that although it retains some\nof the original functions, the scar tissue formed after a wound is inferior to the native tissue\nit replaces. However, there is hope. Medical researchers are now studying\nwhat causes fibroblast cells to secrete excessive amounts of collagen and how we can recruit\nthe body's other cells in regenerating and repopulating\nthe damaged tissue. By learning how to better control wound\nhealing and the formation of scar tissue, we can utilize\nthe multi-billion-dollar budgets currently used to address\nthe aftermath of wounding in a much more efficient manner, and help millions of people live better\nand healthier lives. But until then, at least some of our scars can help us remember to avoid\nthe sorts of things that cause them."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the medical term for scarring in the lungs resulting in shortness of breath?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Myelofibrosis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pulmonary fibrosis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cystic fibrosis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pneumonia"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following functions do well-arranged ECM in the body carry out?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Transportation of nutrients"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cell to cell communication"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cell adhesion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not an outcome of scar formation in humans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Impedement of inter-cell processes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reduced tissue durability"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Growth of new hair follicles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reduced tissue elasticity"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the main and most abundant structural protein present in scar tissue?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Collagen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fibrin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fibroblast"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Keratin"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What happens to the alignment of collagen deposited during the wound healing process?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It changes from a basketweave form to being aligned in a single direction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Changes from being aligned in a single direction to basketweave form"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stays aligned in a single direction before and after wound healing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Stays as basketweave form before and after wound healing"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 48, "lesson": 3, "title": "How a wound heals itself - Sarthak Sinha", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-a-wound-heals-itself-sarthak-sinha", "transcript": {"en": "The largest organ in your body\nisn't your liver or your brain. It's your skin, with a surface area\nof about 20 square feet in adults. Though different areas of the skin\nhave different characteristics, much of this surface performs\nsimilar functions, such as sweating, feeling heat and cold,\nand growing hair. But after a deep cut or wound, the newly healed skin will look different\nfrom the surrounding area, and may not fully regain all \nits abilities for a while, or at all. To understand why this happens, we need to\nlook at the structure of the human skin. The top layer, called the epidermis, consists mostly of hardened cells,\ncalled keratinocytes, and provides protection. Since its outer layer is constantly being\nshed and renewed, it's pretty easy to repair. But sometimes a wound penetrates\ninto the dermis, which contains blood vessels\nand the various glands and nerve endings that enable the skin's many functions. And when that happens, it triggers the\nfour overlapping stages of the regenerative process. The first stage, hemostasis, is the skin's\nresponse to two immediate threats: that you're now losing blood and that the physical barrier of \nthe epidermis has been compromised. As the blood vessels tighten to minimize\nthe bleeding, in a process known as \nvasoconstriction, both threats are averted by forming\na blood clot. A special protein known as fibrin forms\ncross-links on the top of the skin, preventing blood from flowing out\nand bacteria or pathogens from getting in. After about three hours of this,\nthe skin begins to turn red, signaling the next stage, inflammation. With bleeding under control\nand the barrier secured, the body sends special cells to fight any\npathogens that may have gotten through. Among the most important of these\nare white blood cells, known as macrophages, which devour bacteria and damage tissue\nthrough a process known as phagocytosis, in addition to producing growth factors\nto spur healing. And because these tiny soldiers \nneed to travel through the blood to \nget to the wound site, the previously constricted \nblood vessels now expand in a process called vasodilation. About two to three days after the wound, the proliferative stage occurs, when \nfibroblast cells begin to enter the wound. In the process of collagen deposition, they produce a fibrous protein \ncalled collagen in the wound site, forming connective skin tissue\nto replace the fibrin from before. As epidermal cells divide to reform\nthe outer layer of skin, the dermis contracts to close the wound. Finally, in the fourth stage \nof remodeling, the wound matures as the newly deposited\ncollagen is rearranged and converted into specific types. Through this process,\nwhich can take over a year, the tensile strength of the new skin\nis improved, and blood vessels and other connections\nare strengthened. With time, the new tissue \ncan reach from 50-80% of some of its original healthy function, depending on the severity of the initial \nwound and on the function itself. But because the skin\ndoes not fully recover, scarring continues to be a major clinical\nissue for doctors around the world. And even though researchers have made\nsignificant strides in understanding the healing process, many fundamental mysteries\nremain unresolved. For instance, do fibroblast cells arrive\nfrom the blood vessels or from skin tissue adjacent to the wound? And why do some other mammals, \nsuch as deer, heal their wounds much more efficiently\nand completely than humans? By finding the answers to these questions\nand others, we may one day be able to heal ourselves\nso well that scars will be just a memory."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What signals the onset of the inflammation phase?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Formation of a blood clot to stop bleeding"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The ending of the proliferative stage"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Reddening of the skin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Entering of bacteria and pathogens"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The following help in preventing further blood loss following a wound:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fibrin clots"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Macrophage cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Vasodilation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fibroblast cells"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The process of previously constricted blood vessels expanding is known as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vascularization"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Angiogenesis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Vasoconstriction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vasodilation"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Name the protein which helps prevent excessive blood loss from the wound.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fibrin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Collagen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Keratin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Melanin"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What can be an undesired outcome following wound healing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Skin remodeling"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Scar forming"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Epidermis reforming"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dermis reforming"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 48, "lesson": 4, "title": "Ideasthesia: How do ideas feel? - Danko Nikoliƒá", "category": "Consciousness, Sensation and Perception", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/ideasthesia-how-do-ideas-feel-danko-nikolic", "transcript": {"en": "Long before Descartes famously declared,\n\"I think, therefore I am,\" and long after that, scientists and philosophers alike have puzzled over what they call\nthe mind-body problem. Is the mind some separate, non-material\nentity piloting a machine of flesh? Or if it's just a particularly elusive part\nof our physical body, how can it translate the input of our\nanimal senses into the seemingly non-physical\nexperiences that we call thoughts? But though the answers have been\ndebated endlessly, new research suggests that\npart of the problem lies in how we pose the question \nin the first place, assuming a distinction between our\nsensory perception and our ideas that may not really be there. The traditional model of our mental\nfunction has been that the senses provide\nseparate data to our brain which are then translated into the \nappropriate mental phenomena: visual images into trees, auditory\nexperiences into bird songs, and so on. But occasionally, \nwe have come across people whose senses seem to mingle together,\nallowing them to hear colors, or taste sounds. Until recently, the common understanding\nwas that this phenomenon, called synesthesia, was a direct connection between the\nparts of the brain responsible for sensory stimuli such as seeing the color yellow immediately\nupon hearing the tone of b flat. But newer studies have \nshown that synesthesia is actually mediated through our \nunderstanding of the shapes, colors and sounds\nthat our senses apprehend. In order for the cross-sensory\nexperiences to occur, the higher level ideas and concepts\nthat our minds associate with the sensory input must be activated. For example, this shape can be seen as\neither the letter \"s\" or the number \"5,\" and synesthetes associate each with \ndifferent colors or sounds based on how they interpret it despite the purely visual stimulus \nremaining identical. In another study, synesthetes created\nnovel color associations for unfamiliar letters after learning\nwhat the letters were. So because it relies on a connection\nbetween ideas and senses, this mental phenomenon \nunderlying synesthesia is known as ideasthesia. Synesthesia only occurs in some people, although it may be more common\nthan previously thought. But ideasthesia itself is a \nfundamental part of our lives. Virtually all of us recognize the color\nred as warm and blue as cold. Many would agree that bright colors,\nitalic letters and thin lines are high-pitched, while earth tones are low-pitched. And while many of these associations\nare acquired through cultural exposure, others have been demonstrated even\nin infants and apes, suggesting that at least \nsome associations are inborn. When asked to choose between two\npossible names for these shapes, people from entirely different cultural\nand language backgrounds overwhelmingly agree that \"kiki\"\nis the spiky star, while \"bouba\" is the rounded blob, both because of the sounds themselves\nand the shapes our mouths make to produce them. And this leads to even more\nassociations within a rich semantic network. Kiki is described as nervous and clever, while bouba is perceived as lazy and slow. What all of this suggests is that our\neveryday experiences of colors, sounds and other stimuli\ndo not live on separate sensory islands but are organized in a \nnetwork of associations similar to our language network. This is what enables us to \nunderstand metaphors even though they make no logical sense, such as the comparison of snow\nto a white blanket, based on the shared sensations of\nsoftness and lightness. Ideasthesia may even be crucial to art, which relies on a synthesis of\nthe conceptual and the emotional. In great art, idea and aesthesia\nenhance each other, whether it's song lyrics combining\nperfectly with a melody, the thematic content of a painting heightened by its use of\ncolors and brushstrokes, or the well constructed plot of a novel conveyed through perfectly \ncrafted sentences. Most importantly, the network of\nassociations formed by ideasethesia may not only be similar to \nour linguistic network but may, in fact, be an integral part of it. Rather than the traditional view, where our senses first capture \na collection of colors and shapes, or some vibrations in the air, and our mind then classifies them as a\ntree or a siren, ideasthesia suggests that the two\nprocesses occur simultaneously. Our sensory perceptions are shaped by\nour conceptual understanding of the world. and the two are so connected that one\ncannot exist without the other. If this model suggested \nby ideasthesia is accurate, it may have major implications\nfor some of the biggest scientific and philosophical issues\nsurrounding the study of mind. Without a preexisting concept of self, Descartes would not have had an \"I\"\nto attribute the thinking to. And without a preexisting network of\ninterrelated and distinct concepts, our sensory experience of the world\nwould be an undifferentiated mass rather than the discrete objects\nwe actually apprehend. For science, the task is to find where\nthis network lies, how it is formed, and\nhow it interacts with external stimuli. For philosophy, \nthe challenge is to rethink what this new model of consciousness means\nfor our understanding of our selves and our relation to the world around us."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who famously said \"I think, therefore I am?\"", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ren√© Descartes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Immanuel Kant"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Aristotle"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A synesthete that associates colors to graphemes will associate a particular color to the symbol depending on:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "How she understands the meaning of the stimulus--as a '5' or as an 'S'"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The mood"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The time of day"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The term \"ideasthesia\" refers to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Unification of senses"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The phenomenon in which an activation of ideas or concepts evokes experiences"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Being skilled at quickly coming up with jokes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The theory of ideasthesia suggests that the ability to understand a metaphor is based on:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shared sensations induced by seemingly unrelated concepts"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Associations learned in school"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Watching too much TV"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In Descartes' \"I think, therefore I am,\" an important concept contributing to the experience of thinking may be:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The concept of self, the \"I\""}, {"label": "B", "text": "The concept of numbers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The concept of Kiki-Bouba shapes"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Appearing throughout historical records, these mysterious lights that \ncame out of nowhere and disappeared after a short while were thought to be ill omens of\nwar and famine, or the wrath of gods. But recent research has revealed that\ncomets may be even more deeply connected to humanity and our presence on Earth than any of these mythical \nexplanations suggested. When you think of our Solar System,\nyou probably imagine the nine, sorry eight, planets orbiting the Sun. But beyond Neptune,\nfar from the heat of the Sun, there is a sparse ring found \nformed by icy chunks ranging from the size \nof marbles to that of small planets. And thousands of times farther at the\nouter reaches of the Solar System lies a spherical cloud of small \nfragments and gases. Many of these ancient clumps of stardust\nare leftovers from the formation of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago, while some of the most distant may even\ncome from a neighboring system. But sometimes the gravity from \npassing planets or stars pulls them toward our sun, beginning a journey that can take up to\nmillions of years. As the frozen object travels further\ninto the Solar System, the sun grows from a distant spark\nto an inferno, melting the ice for the first time\nin billions of years. Gas and steam eject dust into space, forming a bright surrounding cloud,\ncalled a coma, that can grow even larger than\nthe sun itself. Meanwhile, the intense stream of \nhigh-energy particles constantly emitted by the Sun,\nknown as the solar wind, blows particles away from \nthe comet's core, forming a trail of debris up to millions\nof miles long. The ice, gas and dust reflect \nlight glowing brightly. A comet is born, now orbiting the sun\nalong with the rest of the objects in our Solar System. But as the comet travels through\nthe Solar System, the solar wind tears apart and recombines\nmolecules into various compounds. In some of the compounds that\nscientists found, first in the rubble left by a meteorite\nthat disintegrated above northern Canada, and then in samples collected by a space\ncraft from a passing comet's tail, were nothing less important than\namino acids. Coming together to form proteins\naccording to the instructs encoded in DNA, these are the main active components\nin all living cells, from bacteria to blue whales. If comets are where these building blocks\nof life were first formed, then they are the ultimate source of\nlife on Earth, and, perhaps, some of the other places\nthey visited as well.

If Earth-like planets and the molecules\nfound in DNA are not anomalies, we may be only one \nexample of what's possible when a planet under the right conditions\nis seeded with organic molecules by a passing comet.

So here's 3.14159 which - for a fun fact - that's\nas far as I've memorised and then it carries on and you've marked every 10 digits so there's\n100,000 marker points so we won't get lost, we'll always know where we are in Pi. Where's\nthe Feynman Point? Is that seven hundred and something? This the Feynman Point, six 9s, 999999, so\nthat won't be beaten... there is a string of seven 3s, but that takes another 710,000\ndigits, so we'll be nearly three quarters of the way down the mile of Pi before we find\na longer string of the same digit. And the first one is in the first two metres. Absolutely\nincredible! BRADY: Do you want these? For that. HUGH: Bring the staple gun back. We've just hit 123 yards so we're long past\nthe familiar bits of Pi. So the whole 3.14159, that is a long time ago. You'd think anyone\nwho has memorised Pi, we're now in unfamiliar territory, apart from one guy. What is the\nworld record for memorising Pi, so someone recited over 125 yards of Pi, someone memorised\nall the way to here and couldn't be bothered to remember the next zero. BRADY: Not even a third. There is a run here of seven ascending digits,\nthere it goes, 0456789, that is the first run of seven-digits that go up. Obviously\nwe're missing 1, 2 and 3, it would have been nicer with them, but nowhere in the first\nmillion digits do you get 0 to 9 in order. HUGH: That's nearly three hours. BRADY: I found some heavy bases for cones,\nI've got them in the back... We're half a mile from the start, and the\ntrolley team, are they on the horizon? Okay, Pi has just got a horizon. Okay, see that 4 there, it appears every now\nand then, square number, kind of fun, but then from here you go, wait there's no fours...\nno four, no four, in fact there's no fours until there, look at that, 157 digits and\nthere are no fours for that entire run. They've just vanished. And that is the longest run\nwe will have in the first million digits that has one digit completely missing. With a million decimal places of Pi each digit\nshould appear approximately 100,000 time each, that makes sense, but of course it's not exactly\neven, some of them don't even make it. There are not 100,000 zeroes, zero doesn't make\nit. 1 doesn't make it. 6,7,8 all don't make it. The champion though, is 5. There it is,\nthat there is the 100,000th 5. Okay we're four hours into this and we are\nnearly at a million digits. So they've been coming out a rate of a quarter of a million\ndigits and hour, which is approximately 4,167 digits a minute, and we're almost there. So you guys have done the hard work, do you\nwant to wind off the last of it. And a million digits is there! There! Alright so that is, it's one, in case you\nare wondering. So there you go, we have just, I mean I think\na token round of applause. APPLAUSE So that is absolutely fantastic, and now the\nvery quick process of rolling it all back up again before an aeroplane lands. BRADY: Believe it or not we printed all million\ndigits of Pi using about eight millilitres of ink. There, that's what 8mL looks like.

Donnay", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/is-our-climate-headed-for-mathematical-chaos-victor-j-donnay", "transcript": {"en": "For most of us, two degrees Celsius\nis a tiny difference in temperature, not even enough to make \nyou crack a window. But scientists have warned that as\nCO2 levels in the atmosphere rise, an increase in the Earth's temperature\nby even this amount can lead to catastrophic effects\nall over the world. How can such a small measurable \nchange in one factor lead to massive and unpredictable \nchanges in other factors? The answer lies in the concept of a \nmathematical tipping point, which we can understand through the\nfamiliar game of billiards. The basic rule of billiard motion is that a ball will go straight \nuntil it hits a wall, then bounce off at an angle equal\nto its incoming angle. For simplicity's sake, we'll assume that\nthere is no friction, so balls can keep moving indefinitely. And to simplify the situation further, let's look at what happens with only \none ball on a perfectly circular table. As the ball is struck and begins to move\naccording to the rules, it follows a neat star-shaped pattern. If we start the ball at\ndifferent locations, or strike it at different angles, \nsome details of the pattern change, but its overall form remains the same. With a few test runs, and some basic\nmathematical modeling, we can even predict a ball's path\nbefore it starts moving, simply based on its starting conditions. But what would happen \nif we made a minor change in the table's shape \nby pulling it apart a bit, and inserting two small straight edges \nalong the top and bottom? We can see that as the ball bounces \noff the flat sides, it begins to move all over the table. The ball is still obeying the same rules\nof billiard motion, but the resulting movement no longer\nfollows any recognizable pattern. With only a small change\nto the constraints under which the system operates, we have shifted the billiard motion from behaving in a stable\nand predictable fashion, to fluctuating wildly, thus creating what mathematicians\ncall chaotic motion. Inserting the straight edges into\nthe table acts as a tipping point, switching the systems behavior\nfrom one type of behavior (regular), to another type of behavior (chaotic). So what implications does this simple\nexample have for the much more complicated reality of the Earth's climate? We can think of the shape of the table as \nbeing analogous to the CO2 level and Earth's average temperature: Constraints that impact the \nsystem's performance in the form of the ball's motion \nor the climate's behavior. During the past 10,000 years, the fairly constant CO2 atmospheric \nconcentration of 270 parts per million kept the climate\nwithin a self-stabilizing pattern, fairly regular and hospitable \nto human life. But with CO2 levels now at 400\nparts per million, and predicted to rise to between\n500 and 800 parts per million over the coming century,\nwe may reach a tipping point where even a small additional change \nin the global average temperature would have the same effect as\nchanging the shape of the table, leading to a dangerous shift in the\nclimate's behavior, with more extreme and intense \nweather events, less predictability, and most importantly,\nless hospitably to human life. The hypothetical models that \nmathematicians study in detail may not always look like \nactual situations, but they can provide a framework\nand a way of thinking that can be applied to help understand the\nmore complex problems of the real world. In this case, understanding \nhow slight changes in the constraints impacting a system\ncan have massive impacts gives us a greater appreciation for\npredicting the dangers that we cannot immediately percieve \nwith our own senses. Because once the results do become visible,\nit may already be too late."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "As the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere increases, the temperature of the Earth will:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increase"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Decrease"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Remain the same"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Become cyclical"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "If one billiard is hit at a certain degree angle with no friction on a perfectly circular table, what will happen?

The birds are singing. It looks like the start\nof another lovely day. You're walking happily\nin the park, when, \"Ah-choo!\" A passing stranger has expelled mucus\nand saliva from their mouth and nose. You can feel the droplets\nof moisture land on your skin, but what you can't feel are\nthe thousands, or even millions, of microscopic germs that have covertly\ntraveled through the air and onto your clothing, hands and face. As gross as this scenario sounds, it's actually very common for our bodies\nto be exposed to disease-causing germs, and most of the time,\nit's not nearly as obvious. Germs are found on almost every surface\nwe come into contact with. When we talk about germs, we're actually referring to many different\nkinds of microscopic organisms, including bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses. But what our germs all have in common\nis the ability to interact with our bodies and change how we feel and function. Scientists who study infectious diseases\nhave wondered for decades why it is that some of these germs\nare relatively harmless, while others cause devastating effects\nand can sometimes be fatal. We still haven't solved the entire puzzle, but what we do know\nis that the harmfulness, or virulence, of a germ is a result of evolution. How can it be that the same\nevolutionary process can produce germs that cause\nvery different levels of harm? The answer starts to become clear if we think about a germ's\nmode of transmission, which is the strategy it uses\nto get from one host to the next. A common mode of transmission\noccurs through the air, like the sneeze you just witnessed, and one germ that uses\nthis method is the rhinovirus, which replicates in our upper airways, and is responsible\nfor up to half of all common colds. Now, imagine that after the sneeze, one of three hypothetical\nvarieties of rhinovirus, let's call them \"too much,\"\n\"too little,\" and \"just right,\" has been lucky enough to land on you. These viruses are hardwired to replicate, but because of genetic differences,\nthey will do so at different rates. \"Too much\" multiplies very often, making it very successful\nin the short run. However, this success comes\nat a cost to you, the host. A quickly replicating virus\ncan cause more damage to your body, making cold symptoms more severe. If you're too sick to leave your home, you don't give the virus any opportunities\nto jump to a new host. And if the disease should kill you, the virus' own life cycle will end\nalong with yours. \"Too little,\" on the other hand,\nmultiplies rarely and causes you little harm in the process. Although this leaves you healthy enough\nto interact with other potential hosts, the lack of symptoms means\nyou may not sneeze at all, or if you do, there may be too few viruses\nin your mucus to infect anyone else. Meanwhile, \"just right\" has been\nreplicating quickly enough to ensure that you're carrying\nsufficient amounts of the virus to spread but not so often that you're too sick\nto get out of bed. And in the end, it's the one\nthat will be most successful at transmitting itself to new hosts\nand giving rise to the next generation. This describes what scientists call\ntrade-off hypothesis. First developed in the early 1980s, it predicts that germs will evolve\nto maximize their overall success by achieving a balance between\nreplicating within a host, which causes virulence,\nand transmission to a new host. In the case of the rhinovirus, the hypothesis predicts that its evolution\nwill favor less virulent forms because it relies on close contact\nto get to its next victim. For the rhinovirus,\na mobile host is a good host, and indeed, that is what we see. While most people experience\na runny nose, coughing and sneezing, the common cold is generally mild\nand only lasts about a week. It would be great\nif the story ended there, but germs use many other modes\nof transmission. For example, the malaria parasite,\nplasmodium, is transmitted by mosquitoes. Unlike the rhinovirus, it doesn't need us\nto be up and about, and may even benefit from harming us since a sick and immobile person\nis easier for mosquitoes to bite. We would expect germs\nthat depend less on host mobility, like those transmitted\nby insects, water or food, to cause more severe symptoms. So, what can we do to reduce\nthe harmfulness of infectious diseases? Evolutionary biologist Dr. Paul Ewald has suggested that we can\nactually direct their evolution through simple disease-control methods. By mosquito-proofing houses,\nestablishing clean water systems, or staying home when we get a cold, we can obstruct the transmission\nstrategies of harmful germs while creating a greater dependence\non host mobility. So, while traditional methods\nof trying to eradicate germs may only breed stronger ones\nin the long run, this innovative approach of encouraging\nthem to evolve milder forms could be a win-win situation.

And though most of us still remember\nhim for deriving E=MC^2, his last great contribution to physics\nwas actually a 1935 paper, coauthored with his young colleagues\nBoris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen. Regarded as an odd philosophical\nfootnote well into the 1980s, this EPR paper has recently become central\nto a new understanding of quantum physics, with its description \nof a strange phenomenon now known as entangled states. The paper begins by considering a\nsource that spits out pairs of particles, each with two measurable properties. Each of these measurements has\ntwo possible results of equal probability. Let's say zero or one\nfor the first property, and A or B for the second. Once a measurement is performed, subsequent measurements of the same\nproperty in the same particle will yield the same result. The strange implication of this scenario is not only that the state \nof a single particle is indeterminate until it's measured, but that the measurement then\ndetermines the state. What's more, the measurements \naffect each other. If you measure a particle \nas being in state 1, and follow it up with the second\ntype of measurement, you'll have a 50% chance of\ngetting either A or B, but if you then repeat \nthe first measurement, you'll have a a 50% chance of getting zero even though the particle had already\nbeen measured at one. So switching the property being measured\nscrambles the original result, allowing for a new, random value. Things get even stranger\nwhen you look at both particles. Each of the particles will produce\nrandom results, but if you compare the two, you will find that they are\nalways perfectly correlated. For example, if both particles\nare measured at zero, the relationship will always hold. The states of the two are entangled. Measuring one will tell you the other\nwith absolute certainty. But this entanglement seems to defy\nEinstein's famous theory of relativity because there is nothing to limit the\ndistance between particles. If you measure one in New York at noon, and the other in San Francisco \na nanosecond later, they still give exactly the same result. But if the measurement \ndoes determine the value, then this would require one particle\nsending some sort of signal to the other at 13,000,000 times the speed of light, which according to relativity,\nis impossible. For this reason, Einstein dismissed\nentanglement as \"spuckafte ferwirklung,\" or spooky action at a distance. He decided that quantum mechanics\nmust be incomplete, a mere approximation of a deeper reality\nin which both particles have predetermined states that \nare hidden from us. Supporters of orthodox quantum theory\nlead by Niels Bohr maintained that quantum states\nreally are fundamentally indeterminate, and entanglement allows \nthe state of one particle to depend on that of its distant partner. For 30 years, physics remained \nat an impasse, until John Bell figured out that the key\nto testing the EPR argument was to look at cases involving different\nmeasurements on the two particles. The local hidden variable theories\nfavored by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, strictly limited how often you could\nget results like 1A or B0 because the outcomes would have to be\ndefined in advance. Bell showed that the purely \nquantum approach, where the state is truly \nindeterminate until measured, has different limits\nand predicts mixed measurement results that are impossible in the\npredetermined scenario. Once Bell had worked out how to test\nthe EPR argument, physicists went out and did it. Beginning with John Clauster in the 70s\nand Alain Aspect in the early 80s, dozens of experiments have tested \nthe EPR prediction, and all have found the same thing: quantum mechanics is correct. The correlations between the indeterminate\nstates of entangled particles are real and cannot be explained\nby any deeper variable. The EPR paper turned out to be wrong\nbut brilliantly so. By leading physicists to think deeply\nabout the foundations of quantum physics, it led to further elaboration \nof the theory and helped launch research into subjects\nlike quantum information, now a thriving field with the potential to\ndevelop computers of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the randomness\nof the measured results prevents science fiction scenarios, like using entangled particles\nto send messages faster than light. So relativity is safe, for now.

He imagined taking a cat and\nplacing it in a sealed box with a device that had a 50% chance\nof killing the cat in the next hour. At the end of that hour, he asked,\n\"What is the state of the cat?\" Common sense suggests that the cat\nis either alive or dead, but Schr√∂dinger pointed out that according\nto quantum physics, at the instant before the box is opened,\nthe cat is equal parts alive and dead, at the same time. It's only when the box is opened\nthat we see a single definite state. Until then, the cat is \na blur of probability, half one thing and half the other. This seems absurd, \nwhich was Schr√∂dinger's point. He found quantum physics so \nphilosophically disturbing, that he abandoned the theory\nhe had helped make and turned to writing about biology. As absurd as it may seem, though,\nSchr√∂dinger's cat is very real. In fact, it's essential. If it weren't possible for quantum objects\nto be in two states at once, the computer you're using to watch this\ncouldn't exist. The quantum phenomenon of \nsuperposition is a consequence of the dual\nparticle and wave nature of everything. In order for an object to have\na wavelength, it must extend over some region of space, which means it occupies many positions\nat the same time. The wavelength of an object limited\nto a small region of space can't be perfectly defined, though. So it exists in many different wavelengths\nat the same time. We don't see these wave properties\nfor everyday objects because the wavelength decreases\nas the momentum increases. And a cat is relatively big and heavy. If we took a single atom and blew\nit up to the size of the Solar System, the wavelength of a cat \nrunning from a physicist would be as small as an atom \nwithin that Solar System. That's far too small to detect, so we'll\nnever see wave behavior from a cat. A tiny particle, like an electron, though, can show dramatic evidence\nof its dual nature. If we shoot electrons one at a time at a\nset of two narrow slits cut in a barrier, each electron on the far side is detected\nat a single place at a specific instant, like a particle. But if you repeat this \nexperiment many times, keeping track of all the \nindividual detections, you'll see them trace out a pattern that's\ncharacteristic of wave behavior: a set of stripes - regions with many\nelectrons separated by regions\nwhere there are none at all. Block one of the slits \nand the stripes go away. This shows that the pattern is a result of\neach electron going through both slits at the same time. A single electron isn't choosing \nto go left or right but left and right simultaneously. This superposition of states also leads\nto modern technology. An electron near the nucleus of an atom\nexists in a spread out, wave-like orbit. Bring two atoms close together, and the electrons don't need to \nchoose just one atom but are shared between them. This is how some chemical bonds form. An electron in a molecule isn't on\njust atom A or atom B, but A+ B. As you add more atoms,\nthe electrons spread out more, shared between vast numbers of atoms\nat the same time. The electrons in a solid aren't \nbound to a particular atom but shared among all of them,\nextending over a large range of space. This gigantic superposition of states determines the ways electrons move\nthrough the material, whether it's a conductor or an insulator\nor a semiconductor. Understanding how electrons are shared\namong atoms allows us to precisely control the\nproperties of semiconductor materials, like silicon. Combining different semiconductors\nin the right way allows us to make transistors \non a tiny scale, millions on a single computer chip. Those chips and their spread out electrons power the computer you're using to\nwatch this video. An old joke says that the Internet \nexists to allow the sharing of cat videos.

It's so fast that we measure\nenormous distances by how long it takes\nfor light to travel them. In one year, light travels\nabout 6,000,000,000,000 miles, a distance we call one light year. To give you an idea of just\nhow far this is, the Moon, which took the Apollo astronauts\nfour days to reach, is only one light-second from Earth. Meanwhile, the nearest star beyond\nour own Sun is Proxima Centauri, 4.24 light years away. Our Milky Way is on the order of\n100,000 light years across. The nearest galaxy to our own, Andromeda, is about 2.5 million light years away Space is mind-blowingly vast. But wait, how do we know how\nfar away stars and galaxies are? After all, when we look at the sky,\nwe have a flat, two-dimensional view. If you point you finger to one star,\nyou can't tell how far the star is, so how do astrophysicists figure that out? For objects that are very close by, we can use a concept called\ntrigonometric parallax. The idea is pretty simple. Let's do an experiment. Stick out your thumb and \nclose your left eye. Now, open your left eye and\nclose your right eye. It will look like your thumb has moved, while more distant background objects\nhave remained in place. The same concept applies when\nwe look at the stars, but distant stars are much, much \nfarther away than the length of your arm, and the Earth isn't very large, so even if you had different telescopes\nacross the equator, you'd not see much of a shift in position. Instead, we look at the change in the\nstar's apparent location over six months, the halfway point of the Earth's\nyearlong orbit around the Sun. When we measure the relative positions\nof the stars in summer, and then again in winter,\nit's like looking with your other eye. Nearby stars seem to have moved\nagainst the background of the more distant stars and galaxies. But this method only works for objects no\nmore than a few thousand light years away. Beyond our own galaxy,\nthe distances are so great that the parallax is too small to detect\nwith even our most sensitive instruments. So at this point we have to rely \non a different method using indicators we call standard candles. Standard candles are objects whose\nintrinsic brightness, or luminosity, we know really well. For example, if you know how bright\nyour light bulb is, and you ask your friend to hold\nthe light bulb and walk away from you, you know that the amount of light\nyou receive from your friend will decrease by the distance squared. So by comparing the amount \nof light you receive to the intrinsic brightness \nof the light bulb, you can then tell how far away\nyour friend is. In astronomy, our light bulb turns out to\nbe a special type of star called a cepheid variable. These stars are internally unstable, like a constantly inflating \nand deflating balloon. And because the expansion and contraction\ncauses their brightness to vary, we can calculate their luminosity\nby measuring the period of this cycle, with more luminous stars \nchanging more slowly. By comparing the light\nwe observe from these stars to the intrinsic brightness we've\ncalculated this way, we can tell how far away they are. Unfortunately, this is still not \nthe end of the story. We can only observe individual stars\nup to about 40,000,000 light years away, after which they become \ntoo blurry to resolve. But luckily we have another type\nof standard candle: the famous type 1a supernova. Supernovae, giant stellar explosions\nare one of the ways that stars die. These explosions are so bright, that they outshine the galaxies\nwhere they occur. So even when we can't see \nindividual stars in a galaxy, we can still see supernovae \nwhen they happen. And type 1a supernovae turn out\nto be usable as standard candles because intrinsically bright ones\nfade slower than fainter ones. Through our understanding \nof this relationship between brightness and decline rate, we can use these supernovae \nto probe distances up to several billions of light years away. But why is it important to see\nsuch distant objects anyway? Well, remember how fast light travels. For example, the light emitted by the Sun\nwill take eight minutes to reach us, which means that the light we see now\nis a picture of the Sun eight minutes ago. When you look at the Big Dipper, you're seeing what it looked like\n80 years ago. And those smudgy galaxies? They're millions of light years away. It has taken millions of years for\nthat light to reach us. So the universe itself is in some sense\nan inbuilt time machine. The further we can look back,\nthe younger the universe we are probing. Astrophysicists try to read the history\nof the universe, and understand how\nand where we come from. The universe is constantly sending us\ninformation in the form of light.

{"page": 48, "lesson": 13, "title": "How do vitamins work? - Ginnie Trinh Nguyen", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-s-the-value-of-vitamins-ginnie-trinh-nguyen", "transcript": {"en": "A, C, E, D, B, K. No, this isn't some random,\nout of order alphabet. These are vitamins,\nand just like letters build words, they're the building blocks\nthat keep the body running. Vitamins are organic compounds we need\nto ingest in small amounts to keep functioning. They're the body's builders, defenders\nand maintenance workers, helping it to build muscle and bone,\nmake use of nutrients, capture and use energy\nand heal wounds. If you need convincing about\nvitamin value, just consider the plight of \nolden day sailors, who had no access to vitamin-rich\nfresh produce. They got scurvy. But vitamin C,\nabundant in fruits and vegetables, was the simple antidote to this disease. While bacteria, fungi and plants\nproduce their own vitamins, our bodies can't, so we have to get\nthem from other sources. So how does the body get\nvitamins from out there into here? That's dependent on the form\nthese compounds take. Vitamins come in two types: lipid-soluble and \nwater-soluble, and the difference between them \ndetermines how the body transports and stores vitamins, \nand gets rid of the excess. The water-solubles are vitamin C and B Complex vitamins that are made up of\neight different types that each do something unique. These are dissolved in the watery parts\nof fruits, vegetables and grains, meaning their passage through the body\nis relatively straightforward. Once inside the system,\nthese foods are digested and the vitamins within them are\ntaken up directly by the bloodstream. Because blood plasma is water-based, water-soluble vitamins C and B have their\ntransport cut out for them and can move around freely \nwithin the body. For lipid-soluble vitamins,\ndissolved in fat and found in foods like diary,\nbutter and oils, this trip into the blood is a little\nmore adventurous. These vitamins make it through\nthe stomach and the intestine, where an acidic substance\ncalled bile flows in from the liver, breaking up the fat and preparing it for\nabsorption through the intestinal wall. Because fat-soluble vitamins can't make\nuse of the blood's watery nature, they need something else \nto move them around, and that comes from proteins that attach\nto the vitamins and act like couriers, transporting fat-solubles into the blood\nand around the body. So, this difference between water-\nor fat-soluble vitamins determines how they get into the blood, but also how they're stored \nor rejected from the body. The system's ability to circulate\nwater-soluble vitamins in the bloodstream so easily means that most of them can be passed\nout equally easily via the kidneys. Because of that, \nmost water-soluble vitamins need to be replenished on a daily basis\nthrough the food we eat. But fat-soluble vitamins have\nstaying power because they can be packed into the liver\nand in fat cells. The body treats these parts like a pantry, storing the vitamins there and rationing\nthem out when needed, meaning we shouldn't overload\non this type of vitamin because the body is generally \nwell stocked. Once we figured the logistics\nof transport and storage, the vitamins are left to do the work\nthey came here to do in the first place. Some, like many of the B Complex vitamins,\nmake up coenzymes, whose job it is to help enzymes \nrelease the energy from food. Other B vitamins then help the body\nto use that energy. From vitamin C, you get the ability to\nfight infection and make collagen, a kind of tissue that forms \nbones and teeth and heals wounds. Vitamin A helps make white blood cells,\nkey in the body's defense, helps shape bones and improves vision \nby keeping the cells of the eye in check. Vitamin D gathers calcium and phosphorus \nso we can make bones, and vitamin E works as an antioxidant, getting rid of elements in the body\nthat can damage cells. Finally, from Vitamin K, we score\nthe ability to clot blood, since it helps make the proteins\nthat do this job. Without this vitamin variety, humans face deficiencies that \ncause a range of problems, like fatigue, nerve damage, \nheart disorders, or diseases like rickets and scurvy. On the other hand, too much of any\nvitamin can cause toxicity in the body, so there goes the myth that loading\nyourself with supplements is a great idea. In reality, it's all about getting the\nbalance right, and hitting that vitamin jackpot."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many vitamins are necessary to keep the human body running?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Too many to count"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None are essential"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which vitamins are water-soluble?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A & B"}, {"label": "B", "text": "B & C"}, {"label": "C", "text": "C & D"}, {"label": "D", "text": "D & E"}, {"label": "E", "text": "E & K"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Where can you find water-soluble vitamins in your body?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Skin cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Muscle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Blood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fingernails"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Saliva"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How do lipid-soluble vitamins from milk and butter dissolve in the body?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are covered by lipid droplets and moved around the muscles"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are absorbed directly by the blood because our blood plasma is lipid-based"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They can‚Äôt be dissolved because we can‚Äôt absorb them"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are broken down by acids from the intestines and absorbed into the blood"}, {"label": "E", "text": "They are consolidated into large particles and stored in a specific place in the body"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which benefits can vitamins provide our body?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Release energy from food"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Defend infection and immunity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Make blood and bones"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Make sure all the cells are working properly and sufficiently"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of them"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "How many fruits and vegetables do you need to get enough daily vitamins?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Eat as much as you can of any one fruit or vegetable; there's no limitation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Don't get too many of any one fruit or veggie; levels can become toxic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "One apple per day is enough to have all vitamins you need"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fruits and vegetables aren't necessary; we can eat meat to get all the necessary vitamins"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Different fruits and vegetables provide different vitamins, and we need them all"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}
{"page": 48, "lesson": 14, "title": "A brief history of melancholy - Courtney Stephens", "category": "Medical Conditions", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/a-brief-history-of-melancholy-courtney-stephens", "transcript": {"en": "Sadness is part of the human experience, but for centuries there has \nbeen vast disagreement over what exactly it is and what,\nif anything, to do about it. In its simplest terms, sadness is often thought of as the natural reaction \nto a difficult situation. You feel sad when a friend moves away\nor when a pet dies. When a friend says, \"I'm sad,\" you often respond by asking,\n\"What happened?\" But your assumption that sadness\nhas an external cause outside the self is a relatively new idea. Ancient Greek doctors didn't\nview sadness that way. They believed it was a dark fluid\ninside the body. According to their humoral system, the human body and soul were controlled\nby four fluids, known as humors, and their balance directly influenced\na person's health and temperament. Melancholia comes from\nmelaina kole, the word for black bile,\nthe humor believed to cause sadness. By changing your diet\nand through medical practices, you could bring your humors\ninto balance. Even though we now know\nmuch more about the systems that govern the human body, these Greek ideas about sadness resonate with current views, not on the sadness we all\noccasionally feel, but on clinical depression. Doctors believe that certain \nkinds of long-term, unexplained emotional states are at least\npartially related to brain chemistry, the balance of various chemicals \npresent inside the brain. Like the Greek system, changing the balance of these chemicals\ncan deeply alter how we respond to even extremely\ndifficult circumstances. There's also a long tradition\nof attempting to discern the value of sadness, and in that discussion, you'll find a strong argument\nthat sadness is not only an inevitable part of life\nbut an essential one. If you've never felt melancholy, you've missed out on part of\nwhat it means to be human. Many thinkers contend that melancholy\nis necessary in gaining wisdom. Robert Burton, born in 1577, spent his life studying the causes\nand experience of sadness. In his masterpiece\n\"The Anatomy of Melancholy,\" Burton wrote, \"He that increaseth wisdom\nincreaseth sorrow.\" The Romantic poets of \nthe early 19th century believed melancholy allows us to more\ndeeply understand other profound emotions, like beauty and joy. To understand the sadness of the trees\nlosing their leaves in the fall is to more fully understand the cycle\nof life that brings flowers in the spring. But wisdom and emotional intelligence seem\npretty high on the hierarchy of needs. Does sadness have value on\na more basic, tangible, maybe even evolutionary level? Scientists think that crying\nand feeling withdrawn is what originally helped our\nancestors secure social bonds and helped them get the support they needed. Sadness, as opposed to anger or violence,\nwas an expression of suffering that could immediately bring people closer\nto the suffering person, and this helped both the person\nand the larger community to thrive. Perhaps sadness helped generate\nthe unity we needed to survive, but many have wondered whether\nthe suffering felt by others is anything like the suffering\nwe experience ourselves. The poet Emily Dickinson wrote, \"I measure every Grief I meet\nWith narrow, probing Eyes - I wonder if it weighs like MIne -\nOr has an Easier size.\" And in the 20th century, medical anthropologists,\nlike Arthur Kleinman, gathered evidence from the way\npeople talk about pain to suggest that emotions aren't\nuniversal at all, and that culture, particularly the way\nwe use language, can influence how we feel. When we talk about heartbreak, the feeling of brokenness \nbecomes part of our experience, where as in a culture that talks \nabout a bruised heart, there actually seems to be a different\nsubjective experience. Some contemporary thinkers \naren't interested in sadness' subjectivity \nversus universality, and would rather use technology to\neliminate suffering in all its forms. David Pearce has suggested\nthat genetic engineering and other contemporary processes cannot only alter the way humans\nexperience emotional and physical pain, but that world ecosystems \nought to be redesigned so that animals don't suffer in the wild. He calls his project \n\"paradise engineering.\" But is there something sad about\na world without sadness? Our cavemen ancestors and favorite poets might not want any part \nof such a paradise. In fact, the only things about sadness\nthat seem universally agreed upon are that it has been felt by most\npeople throughout time, and that for thousands of years, one of the best ways we have to deal\nwith this difficult emotion is to articulate it, to try to express\nwhat feels inexpressable. In the words of Emily Dickinson, \"'Hope' is the thing with feathers -\nThat perches in the soul - \"And sings the tune without the words -\nAnd never stops - at all -\""}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In Ancient Greece, doctors believed that the body and mind were controlled by four ______, one of which was black bile, which gives us the word melancholy.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Elements"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fluids"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Humors"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vapors"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Evolutionary theorists have posited that sadness was an evolutionary benefit because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It helped strengthen social bonds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It helped our ancestors expand their descriptive vocabulary"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It helped in trying to develop a tribal justice system"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It wasn't a benefit"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Paradise Engineering is the idea that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Experiencing difficult emotions is what often leads to changes for the better"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Difficult emotions can be experienced as positive with some effort"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All forms of suffering can and should be eliminated from the world"}, {"label": "D", "text": "We live in the best possible world"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Medical anthropologist Arthur Kleinman compared:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "How much pain different people experience during surgery"}, {"label": "B", "text": "How people describe pain in different cultures"}, {"label": "C", "text": "How poets have expressed suffering"}, {"label": "D", "text": "How human fossils bare the proof that our ancient ancestors felt similar emotions to ours"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Contemporary ideas about the neurochemical nature of depression has some parallel with ancient Greek ideas about melancholy because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Both systems believe that diet and leeches are effective methods for bringing the mind into balance"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Both systems believe that suffering is a beautiful thing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both systems focus on the experiences in life, like grief and heartbreak, that are linked to emotional pain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both focus on suffering as something that has a physical basis in the body"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 48, "lesson": 15, "title": "Is telekinesis real? - Emma Bryce", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/is-telekinesis-real-emma-bryce", "transcript": {"en": "When the infamous fictional character, Carrie White, left her high school\nprom hall ablaze, and brought terror upon her town, she relied on her powers of telekinesis, the ability to manipulate physical\nobjects using the power of the mind alone. But while Carrie is just a fictional film\nbased upon a fictional book, belief in telekinesis\nisn't fictional at all. For centuries, humans have claimed\nthey really do have the power to control the motion of objects\nusing only their minds. Levitation, opening doors at will\nand spoon bending are all intriguing examples. It happens in the Matrix when Neo\nfreezes bullets midair, and it's a skill that \nYoda has honed to a T. But is telekinesis real, or just as fictional as \nCarrie, Yoda and Neo combined? To investigate, we need to evaluate\ntelekinetic claims through a scientific lens\nusing the scientific method. Telekinesis is part of the discipline\ncalled parapsychology, in which researchers study \npsychic phenomena. Parapsychologists regard what they \ndo as a science, but other scientists disagree. Let's start with a few basic observations. Observation #1: While there are loads of anecdotes out\nthere about telekinesis, there's no scientific proof \nthat it exists; no studies conducted according to\nthe scientific method and repeated under lab conditions\ncan show that its real. In the 1930s, the so-called father\nof parapsychology, Joseph Banks Rhine, tested in the lab whether people\ncould use telekinesis to make a dice roll the way \nthey wanted it to. But afterwards, scientists couldn't\nreplicate his results, and since replication is key\nto proving an idea, that was a problem. Aside from scientists, there are also countless\nself-proclaimed telekinetics, but all have been exposed as tricksters, or can't perform under conditions\nwhere they're not totally in control, suggesting that they manipulate the\nsituation to get the results they want. Today, there's even a huge stash of prize\nmoney available from lots of organizations for anyone who can prove that psychic\nabilities, like telekinesis, are real. But these riches remain unclaimed. Observation #2: When we investigate telekinesis, there's no consensus about\nwhat exactly is being measured. Are powerful, Yoda-like brainwaves\nat work perhaps? Since nobody agrees, it's difficult\nto apply a research standard, something required in all \nother types of science to test the validity of ideas. Observation #3: The point of science is to\ndiscover the unknown, and in the history of \nscientific investigation, it's definitely happened that new discoveries have \ngone against established science, and even overturned \nwhole branches of science. Such discoveries must be \nproven extra carefully to withstand skepticism. In the case of telekinesis, the idea goes against established science, but lacks the powerful\nevidence in favor of it. Our universe is controlled\nand explained by the laws of physics, and one of these laws tells us\nthat brain waves can't control objects because they're neither strong\nnor far-reaching enough to influence anything \noutside of our skulls. Physics also tells us that the only forces\nthat can influence objects from afar are magnetic and gravitational. Probably the closest thing to \ntelekinesis that science can explain is the use of thoughts\nto control a robotic arm. In the brains of stroke \npatients who can't move, researchers can implant tiny wires\ninto the region that controls movement, and then train the patient to \nconcentrate on moving a robotic arm, which acts like an extension\nof their minds, and it works. It's amazing, but it isn't telekinesis. The patients thoughts aren't just vague,\nundetectable things. They're measurable brain signals, translated through wires into a robot. Science can measure, test\nand explain the motion, and that's how we've shown that \nthis kind of mind control is real. Science is a slow process of accumulating the evidence that either stands \nfor or against an idea. When we stack up evidence, we can see which tower grows tallest, and in the case of telekinesis,\nit's not the tower showing that it exists. Some say this mystical phenomenon\ncan't fit within the confines of science, and that's okay. But then telekinesis becomes purely\na matter of personal conviction. If something can't be \nassessed scientifically, then it can't be described\nas scientific either. So the results of our investigation reveal that however much \nwe may want to believe that the force really is within us, the case for telekinesis\nremains weak. Sorry Neo, Carrie and Yoda.

Earth's average surface temperature\nhas warmed by .8 Celsius since 1750. When carbon dioxide concentrations\nin the atmosphere have doubled, which is expected before the end\nof the 21st century, researchers project global temperatures will have risen by \n1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. If the increase is near the low end,\n1.5 Celsius, then we're already halfway there,\nand we should be more able to adapt with some regions becoming drier\nand less productive, but others becoming warmer,\nwetter and more productive. On the other hand, a rise of 4.5 degrees\nCelsius would be similar in magnitude to the warming that's occurred since\nthe last glacial maximum 22,000 years ago, when most of North America was under\nan ice sheet two kilometers thick. So that would represent a \ndramatic change of climate. So it's vitally important for scientists\nto predict the change in temperature with as much precision as possible\nso that society can plan for the future. The present range of uncertainty\nis simply too large to be confident of how best\nto respond to climate change. But this estimate of 1.5 to 4.5 Celsius\nfor a doubling of carbon dioxide hasn't changed in 35 years. Why haven't we been able \nto narrow it down? The answer is that we don't yet understand\naerosols and clouds well enough. But a new experiment at CERN\nis tackling the problem. In order to predict how\nthe temperature will change, scientists need to know something\ncalled Earth's climate sensitivity, the temperature change in response\nto a radiative forcing. A radiative forcing is \na temporary imbalance between the energy received from the Sun\nand the energy radiated back out to space, like the imbalance caused by an\nincrease of greenhouse gases. To correct the imbalance,\nEarth warms up or cools down. We can determine Earth's\nclimate sensitivity from the experiment that we've already performed in the industrial age \nsince 1750 and then use this number to determine\nhow much more it will warm for various projected radiative forcings\nin the 21st century. To do this, we need to know\ntwo things: First, the global temperature rise\nsince 1750, and second, the radiative forcing\nof the present day climate relative to the pre-industrial climate. For the radiative forcings,\nwe know that human activities have increased greenhouse gases\nin the atmosphere, which have warmed the planet. But our activities have at the same time\nincreased the amount of aerosol particles in clouds,\nwhich have cooled the planet. Pre-industrial greenhouse gas\nconcentrations are well measured from bubbles trapped in ice cores\nobtained in Greenland and Antarctica. So the greenhouse gas forcings\nare precisely known. But we have no way of directly measuring\nhow cloudy it was in 1750. And that's the main source of uncertainty\nin Earth's climate sensitivity. To understand pre-industrial cloudiness, we must use computer models\nthat reliably simulate the processes responsible for \nforming aerosols in clouds. Now to most people, aerosols are the thing\nthat make your hair stick, but that's only one type of aerosol. Atmospheric aerosols are tiny liquid\nor solid particles suspended in the air. They are either primary, from dust, sea spray salt\nor burning biomass, or secondary, formed by gas to\nparticle conversion in the atmosphere, also known as particle nucleation. Aerosols are everywhere in the atmosphere, and they can block out the sun\nin polluted urban environments, or bathe distant mountains in a blue haze. More importantly, a cloud droplet cannot\nform without an aerosol particle seed. So without aerosol particles,\nthere'd be no clouds, and without clouds,\nthere'd be no fresh water. The climate would be much hotter,\nand there would be no life. So we owe our existence\nto aerosol particles. However, despite their importance, how aerosol particles form\nin the atmosphere and their effect on clouds \nare poorly understood. Even the vapors responsible\nfor aerosol particle formation are not well established because they're present in only\nminute amounts, near one molecule per million million\nmolecules of air. This lack of understanding\nis the main reason for the large uncertainty \nin climate sensitivity, and the corresponding wide range\nof future climate projections. However, an experiment underway at CERN,\nnamed, perhaps unsurprisingly, \"Cloud\" has managed to build a steel vessel\nthat's large enough and has a low enough contamination,\nthat aerosol formation can, for the first time, be measured under\ntightly controlled atmospheric conditions in the laboratory. In its first five years of operation,\nCloud has identified the vapors responsible for aerosol particle\nformation in the atmosphere, which include sulfuric acid,\nammonia, amines, and biogenic vapors from trees. Using an ionizing particle beam\nfrom the CERN proton synchrotron, Cloud is also investigating\nif galactic cosmic rays enhance the formation of \naerosols in clouds. This has been suggested as a possible\nunaccounted natural climate forcing agent since the flux of cosmic rays raining\ndown on the atmosphere varies with solar activity. So Cloud is addressing two big questions: Firstly, how cloudy was the \npre-industrial climate? And, hence, how much have\nclouds changed due to human activities? That knowledge will help sharpen\nclimate projections in the 21st century. And secondly, could the puzzling\nobservations of solar climate variability in the pre-industrial climate be explained\nby an influence of galactic cosmic rays on clouds?

The Hubble Telescope has enabled us to see objects in space as far \n13,000,000,000 light years away. But this still doesn't give us the answers\nto all our questions, questions like, \"What is the universe\nmade of?\" \"Which elements are the most abundant?\" \"Does space contain undiscovered\nforms of matter?\" \"Could there be antimatter stars\nor galaxies?\" Some of these questions cannot\nbe answered solely from visual images, but what if we had messengers\nbringing us physical data from distant parts of the cosmos, beyond the reach of \nexplorers or satellites? In a way, we do, and these \n\"space messengers\" are called cosmic rays. Cosmic rays were first discovered\nin 1912 by Victor Hess when he set out to explore variations\nin the atmosphere's level of radiation, which had been thought to\nemanate from the Earth's crust. By taking measurements on board\na flying balloon during an eclipse, Hess demonstrated both that\nthe radiation actually increased at greater altitudes\nand that the sun could not be its source. The startling conclusion was that \nit wasn't coming from anywhere within the Earth's atmosphere\nbut from outer space. Our universe is composed of many\nastronomical objects. BIllions of stars of all sizes, black holes,\nactive galactic nuclei, astroids, planets and more. During violent disturbances, such as a\nlarge star exploding into a supernova, billions of particles are \nemitted into space. Although they are called rays, cosmic rays consist of these \nhigh energy particles rather than the photons that\nmake up light rays. While the light from an explosion\ntravels in a straight line at its famous constant speed, the particles are trapped\nin extraordinary loops by magnetic shockwaves \ngenerated by the explosion. Crossing back and forth\nthrough these magnetic field lines accelerates them to almost the speed of\nlight before they escape. There are lots of cosmic rays in space,\nand some of these particles have traveled for billions of years before reaching Earth. When they enter our atmosphere,\nthey collide with the molecules there, generating secondary cosmic rays, lighter particles with less energy\nthan the original. Most of these are absorbed \ninto the atmosphere, but some are able to reach the ground,\neven passing through our bodies. At sea level, this radiation is fairly low. But people who spend a lot of time\nat higher altitudes, such as airline crews,\nare exposed to much more. What makes cosmic rays\nuseful as messengers is that they carry the traces\nof their origins. By studying the frequency\nwith which different particles occur, scientists are able to determine\nthe relative abundance of elements, such as hydrogen and helium,\nwithin the universe. But cosmic rays may provide\neven more fascinating information about the fabric of the universe itself. An experiment called\nthe Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, A.M.S., has recently been installed on board\nthe International Space Station, containing several detectors that can\nseparately measure a cosmic ray particle's velocity,\ntrajectory, radiation, mass and energy, as well as whether the particle\nis matter or antimatter. While the two are normally\nindistinguishable, their opposite charges enable them\nto be detected with the help of a magnet. The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is\ncurrently measuring 50 million particles per day with information about each particle being\nsent in real time from the space station to the A.M.S. control room at CERN. Over the upcoming months and years, it's expected to yield both amazing\nand useful information about antimatter, the possible existence of dark matter, and even possible ways\nto mitigate the effects of cosmic radiation on space travel. As we stay tuned for new discoveries,\nlook to the sky on a clear night, and you may see the\nInternational Space Station, where the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer\nreceives the tiny messengers that carry cosmic secrets."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In 1912, by taking measurements on board a flying balloon during an eclipse, Victor Hess discovered that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The radiation increased at lower altitudes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The radiation increased at greater altitudes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The radiation was constant at all the altitudes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "There was no radiation in space; radiation was coming from Earth"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Cosmic rays consist of high-energy particles generated by astrophysical objects and accelerated at almost the speed of light by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Light"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gravity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Magnetic shock waves"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gas"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Cosmic rays travel in our galaxy:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Following as the light a straight line from the source to the observer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Trapped in extraordinary loops by the magnetic fields lines that fill the galaxy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "At the speed of light"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In pairs"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Secondary cosmic rays:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Carry information about the astrophysical sources"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Have higher energy than primary cosmic rays"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Are generated by the interaction of a primary cosmic ray with the atmosphere"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Are produced by supernovae explosion"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which one of these phrases is false:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cosmic rays are messengers coming from space that carry the traces of their origins"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cosmic rays provides information about the amounts and types of matter which compose the Universe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cosmic rays are produced in violent phenomena as supernovae explosion and can travel in our galaxy billion of years before reaching Earth"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cosmic rays consists of light, measured by the Hubble Space Telescope and give us information about stars evolution and our solar system"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of these phrase about the A.M.S. experiment is false?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A.M.S. is located at CERN to measure secondary cosmic rays coming from the interactions in the atmosphere"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A.M.S. is located on the International Space Station, outside atmosphere to measure primary cosmic rays and its control room is at CERN"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A.M.S measuring cosmic rays studies also antimatter and dark matter in space"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Containing several detectors can separately measure particle‚Äôs velocity, trajectory, radiation, mass, and energy, as well as whether the particle is matter or antimatter"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

They encode the molecules that\nmake up your body, from the keratin in your toenails,\nto the collagen at the tip of your nose, to the dopamine surging around\ninside your brain. Other species have genes of their own. A spider has genes for spider silk. An oak tree has genes for chlorophyll,\nwhich turns sunlight into wood. So where did all those genes come from? It depends on the gene. Scientists suspect that life\nstarted on Earth about 4 billion years ago. The early life forms were\nprimitive microbes with a basic set of genes for\nthe basic tasks required to stay alive. They passed down those basic genes\nto their offspring through billions of generations. Some of them still do the same jobs\nin our cells today, like copying DNA. But none of those microbes had genes\nfor spider silk or dopamine. There are a lot more genes on Earth today\nthan there were back then. It turns out that a lot of those\nextra genes were born from mistakes. Each time a cell divides,\nit makes new copies of its DNA. Sometimes it accidentally copies\nthe same stretch of DNA twice. In the process, it may make an extra copy\nof one of its genes. At first, the extra gene works the same\nas the original one. But over the generations, \nit may pick up new mutations. Those mutations may change how\nthe new gene works, and that new gene may duplicate again. A surprising number of our \nmutated genes emerged more recently; many in just the past few million years. The youngest evolved after our own species\nbroke off from our cousins, the apes. While it may take over a million years\nfor a single gene to give rise to a whole family of genes, scientists are finding that once \nthe new genes evolve, they can quickly take on\nessential functions. For example, we have hundreds of genes\nfor the proteins in our noses that grab odor molecules. The mutations let them grab\ndifferent molecules, giving us the power to perceive trillions\nof different smells. Sometimes mutations have\na bigger effect on new copies of genes. They may cause a gene to make its\nprotein in a different organ, or at a different time of life, or the protein may start doing\na different job altogether. In snakes, for example, there's a gene\nthat makes a protein for killing bacteria. Long ago, the gene duplicated\nand the new copy mutated. That mutation changed\nthe signal in the gene about where it should make its protein. Instead of becoming active in\nthe snake's pacreas, it started making this bacteria-killing\nprotein in the snake's mouth. So when the snake bit its prey,\nthis enzyme got into the animal's wound. And when this protein proved\nto have a harmful effect, and helped the snake catch more prey, it became favored. So now what was a gene in the pancreas\nmakes a venom in the mouth that kills the snake's prey. And there are even more incredible ways\nto make a new gene. The DNA of animals and plants\nand other species contain huge stretches without any\nprotein coding genes. As far as scientists can tell,\nits mostly random sequences of genetic gibberish that serve\nno function. These stretches of DNA\nsometimes mutate, just like genes do. Sometimes those mutations\nturn the DNA into a place where a cell can start reading it. Suddenly the cell is making a new protein. At first, the protein may be useless,\nor even harmful, but more mutations can \nchange the shape of the protein. The protein may start\ndoing something useful, something that makes an organism\nhealthier, stronger, better able to reproduce. Scientists have found these new genes\nat work in many parts of animal bodies. So our 20,000 genes have many origins, from the origin of life, to new genes\nstill coming into existence from scratch.

Decorating your birthday suit would add\nanother personal story to a history of tattoos stretching back\nat least 8000 years. Tattooed mummies from around the world\nattest to the universality of body modification\nacross the millennia, and to the fact that you really were\nstuck with it forever if your civilization never got around\nto inventing laser removal. A mummy from the Chinchorro culture\nin pre-Incan Peru has a mustache tattooed\non his upper lip. √ñtzi, mummified iceman of the Alps, has\npatterned charcoal tats along his spine, behind his knee \nand around his ankles, which might be from an early\nsort of acupuncture. The mummy of Amunet, a priestess \nin Middle Kingdom Egypt, features tattoos thought to symbolize\nsexuality and fertility. Even older than the mummies, figurines of seemingly tattooed\npeople, and tools possibly used for tattooing\ndate back tens of thousands of years. Tattoos don't have one historical\norigin point that we know of, but why do we English speakers\ncall them all tattoos? The word is an anglophonic modification\nof \"tatao,\" a Polynesian word used in Tahiti, where English captain James Cook\nlanded in 1769 and encountered heavily tattooed\nmen and women. Stories of Cook's findings\nand the tattoos his crew acquired cemented our usage of \"tattoo\" \nover previous words like \"scarring,\" \"painting,\" and \"staining,\" and sparked a craze in Victorian\nEnglish high society. We might think of Victorians\nhaving Victorian attitudes about such a risque thing, and you can find such sentiments, and even\nbans, on tattooing throughout history. But while publicly some Brits looked down\ntheir noses at tattoos, behind closed doors \nand away from their noses, lots of people had them. Reputedly, Queen Victoria had a tiger\nfighting a python, and tattoos became very popular\namong Cook's fellow soldiers, who used them to note their travels. You crossed the Atlantic? Get an anchor. Been south of the Equator?\nTime for your turtle tat. But Westerners sported tattoos \nlong before meeting the Samoans and Maori \nof the South Pacific. Crusaders got the Jerusalem Cross\nso if they died in battle, they'd get a Christian burial. Roman soldiers on Hadrian's Wall\nhad military tattoos and called the Picts beyond it \"Picts,\"\nfor the pictures painted on them. There's also a long tradition\nof people being tattooed unwillingly. Greeks and Romans tattooed slaves\nand mercenaries to discourage escape and desertion. Criminals in Japan were tattooed as such\nas far back as the 7th century. Most infamously, the Nazis tattooed\nnumbers on the chest or arms of Jews and other prisoners\nat the Auschwitz concentration camp in order to identify stripped corpses. But tattoos forced on prisoners\nand outcasts can be redefined as people take ownership\nof that status or history. Primo Levi survived Auschwitz and wore\nshort sleeves to Germany after the war to remind people of the crime\nhis number represented. Today, some Holocaust \nsurvivors' descendants have their relatives numbers'\ntattooed on their arms. The Torah has rules against tattoos, but what if you want to make indelible\nwhat you feel should never be forgotten? And those criminals and outcasts of Japan,\nwhere tattooing was eventually outlawed from the mid-19th century to \njust after World War II, added decoration to their penal tattoos, with designs borrowed from\nwoodblock prints, popular literature and mythical spirtual iconography. Yakuza gangs viewed their outsider tattoos\nas signs of lifelong loyalty and courage. After all, they lasted forever\nand it really hurt to get them.

It says that you can never simultaneously\nknow the exact position and the exact speed of an object\nand shows up as a metaphor in everything from literary criticism\nto sports commentary. Uncertainty is often explained as a result\nof measurement, that the act of measuring an object's\nposition changes its speed, or vice versa. The real origin is much deeper\nand more amazing. The Uncertainty Principle exists\nbecause everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave\nat the same time. In quantum mechanics, the exact position\nand exact speed of an object have no meaning. To understand this, we need to think about what it means\nto behave like a particle or a wave. Particles, by definition, exist in \na single place at any instant in time. We can represent this by a graph\nshowing the probability of finding the object at a particular place,\nwhich looks like a spike, 100% at one specific position,\nand zero everywhere else. Waves, on the other hand,\nare disturbances spread out in space, like ripples covering \nthe surface of a pond. We can clearly identify features\nof the wave pattern as a whole, most importantly, its wavelength, which is the distance between two \nneighboring peaks, or two neighboring valleys. But we can't assign it a single position. It has a good probability of \nbeing in lots of different places. Wavelength is essential for\nquantum physics because an object's wavelength\nis related to its momentum, mass times velocity. A fast-moving object has lots of momentum, which corresponds to \na very short wavelength. A heavy object has lots of momentum\neven if it's not moving very fast, which again means a very short wavelength. This is why we don't notice\nthe wave nature of everyday objects. If you toss a baseball up in the air, its wavelength is a billionth of a \ntrillionth of a trillionth of a meter, far too tiny to ever detect. Small things, \nlike atoms or electrons though, can have wavelengths big enough\nto measure in physics experiments. So, if we have a pure wave, \nwe can measure its wavelength, and thus its momentum,\nbut it has no position. We can know a particles position\nvery well, but it doesn't have a wavelength,\nso we don't know its momentum. To get a particle with both position\nand momentum, we need to mix the two pictures to make a graph that has waves,\nbut only in a small area. How can we do this? By combining waves \nwith different wavelengths, which means giving our quantum object some\npossibility of having different momenta. When we add two waves, \nwe find that there are places where the peaks line up,\nmaking a bigger wave, and other places where the peaks of one\nfill in the valleys of the other. The result has regions where\nwe see waves separated by regions of nothing at all. If we add a third wave, the regions where the waves cancel out\nget bigger, a fourth and they get bigger still,\nwith the wavier regions becoming narrower. If we keep adding waves,\nwe can make a wave packet with a clear wavelength\nin one small region. That's a quantum object with both\nwave and particle nature, but to accomplish this,\nwe had to lose certainty about both position and momentum. The positions isn't restricted \nto a single point. There's a good probability\nof finding it within some range of the center of the wave packet, and we made the wave packet\nby adding lots of waves, which means there's \nsome probability of finding it with the momentum corresponding\nto any one of those. Both position and momentum\nare now uncertain, and the uncertainties are connected. If you want to reduce \nthe position uncertainty by making a smaller wave packet,\nyou need to add more waves, which means a bigger momentum uncertainty. If you want to know the momentum better,\nyou need a bigger wave packet, which means a bigger position uncertainty. That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, first stated by German physicist\nWerner Heisenberg back in 1927. This uncertainty isn't a matter\nof measuring well or badly, but an inevitable result\nof combining particle and wave nature. The Uncertainty Principle isn't just \na practical limit on measurment. It's a limit on what properties \nan object can have, built into the fundamental structure\nof the universe itself."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The wavelength of a quantum object is determined by its:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Position"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Momentum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Composition"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Multiple properties"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "For a quantum particle to have a long wavelength, it should have:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Have a large mass and move at high speed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hard a large mass and move at low speed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Have a small mass and move at high speed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Have a small mass and move at low speed"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Adding together multiple waves to make a wave packet means that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "There are multiple particles in the packet, each with a different wavelength"}, {"label": "B", "text": "There are multiple particles in the packet, each with a different position"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The object has a single momentum but can be found in one of many positions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The object has a single position but can be found in one of many momenta"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "If you want to make a smaller wave packet, you need to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Add more waves, increasing the uncertainty in wavelength"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Add fewer waves, decreasing the uncertainty in wavelength"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increase the mass of the object"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increase the speed of the object"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "We can see wave behavior in electrons more easily than in baseballs because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Electrons are small particles, with very well-defined positions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Electrons are very light particles and thus have low momentum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Electrons are usually moving very fast and thus have a long wavelength"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Electrons are usually moving very slowly and thus have a long wavelength"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

All of the other weird stuff you might\nhave heard about quantum physics, Schrodinger's Cat, God playing dice,\nspooky action at a distance, all of it follows directly from the fact that everything has both \nparticle and wave nature. This might sound crazy. If you look around, you'll see waves\nin water and particles of rock, and they're nothing alike. So why would you think to combine them? Physicists didn't just decide to mash\nthese things together out of no where. Rather, they were led to \nthe dual nature of the universe through a process of small steps, fitting together lots of bits of evidence,\nlike pieces in a puzzle. The first person to seriously \nsuggest the dual nature of light was Albert Einstein in 1905, but he was picking up an \nearlier idea from Max Planck. Planck explained the colors of light\nemitted by hot objects, like the filament in a light bulb, but to do it, he needed a desperate trick: he said the object was \nmade up of oscillators that could only emit light\nin discrete chunks, units of energy that depend on \nthe frequency of the light. Planck was never really happy with this,\nbut Einstein picked it up and ran with it. He applied Planck's idea to light itself,\nsaying that light, which everybody knew was a wave,\nis really a stream of photons, each with a discrete amount of energy. Einstein himself called this\nthe only truly revolutionary thing he did, but it explains the way light shining on \na metal surface knocks loose electrons. Even people who hated the idea\nhad to agree that it works brilliantly. The next puzzle piece came from \nErnest Rutherford in England. In 1909, Ernest Marsden and Hans Geiger,\nworking for Rutherford, shot alpha particles at gold atoms and were stunned to find that some\nbounced straight backwards. This showed that most of the mass of the \natom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus. The cartoon atom you learn \nin grade school, with electrons orbiting\nlike a miniature solar system, that's Rutherford's. There's one little problem with\nRutherford's atom: it can't work. Classical physics tells us\nthat an electron whipping around in a circle emits light, and we use this all the time\nto generate radio waves and X-rays. Rutherford's atoms should spray X-rays\nin all directions for a brief instant before the electron spirals in\nto crash into the nucleus. But Niels Bohr, a Danish theoretical\nphysicist working with Rutherford, pointed out that atoms obviously exist, so maybe the rules of physics \nneeded to change. Bohr proposed that an electron\nin certain special orbits doesn't emit any light at all. Atoms absorb and emit light\nonly when electrons change orbits, and the frequency of the light\ndepends on the energy difference in just the way Planck\nand Einstein introduced. Bohr's atom fixes Rutherford's problem and explains why atoms emit only\nvery specific colors of light. Each element has its own special orbits, and thus its own unique\nset of frequencies. The Bohr model has one tiny problem: there's no reason for \nthose orbits to be special. But Louis de Broglie, \na French PhD student, brought everything full circle. He pointed out that if light,\nwhich everyone knew is a wave, behaves like a particle, maybe the electron, \nwhich everyone knew is a particle, behaves like a wave. And if electrons are waves, it's easy to explain Bohr's rule\nfor picking out the special orbits. Once you have the idea that \nelectrons behave like waves, you can go look for it. And within a few years, \nscientists in the US and UK had observed wave behavior from electrons. These days we have a wonderfully clear\ndemonstration of this: shooting single electrons at a barrier\nwith slits cut in it. Each electron is detected \nat a specific place at a specific time, like a particle. But when you repeat the experiment\nmany times, all the individual electrons trace out\na pattern of stripes, characteristic of wave behavior. The idea that particles behave like waves,\nand vice versa, is one of the strangest\nand most powerful in physics. Richard Feynman famously said that this illustrates the central mystery\nof quantum mechanics. Everything else follows from this, like pieces of a puzzle \nfalling into place."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who was the first person to suggest that electrons behave like waves?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Max Planck"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Albert Einstein"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ernest Rutherford"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Niels Bohr"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Louis de Broglie"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What did Max Planck use to explain the spectrum of light emitted by a hot object?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Photons, particles of light"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Imaginary \"oscillators\" that can only emit light is discrete chunks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A \"solar system\" model of the atom with electrons orbiting the nucelus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A set of \"special orbits\" in atoms where electrons don't emit light"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Electrons that have wave nature"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How did Ernest Rutherford determine that most of the mass of an atom is in a tiny nucleus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "From the spectrum of light emitted by hot objects"}, {"label": "B", "text": "From the way light knocks electrons loose from a metal surface"}, {"label": "C", "text": "From the way alpha particles bounce off gold atoms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "From the frequencies of light that atoms absorb and emit"}, {"label": "E", "text": "From the way electrons go through two slits at the same time"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What did Einstein call the only truly revolutionary thing that he did?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The theory of relativity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The idea that electrons behave like waves"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The idea that light waves behave like particles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The idea that atoms have special orbits where electrons don't emit light"}, {"label": "E", "text": "E=mc^2"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the problem with Rutherford‚Äôs ‚Äúsolar system‚Äù model of the atom?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Classical physics predicts that light is a wave, not a particle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Classical physics predicts that electrons are particles, not waves"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Classical physics predicts that alpha particles shouldn't bounce off gold atoms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Classical physics predicts that orbiting electrons should emit x-rays"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Classical physics predicts that electrons should go through only one slit at a time"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 48, "lesson": 24, "title": "The chemistry of cold packs - John Pollard", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-cold-packs-get-cold-so-fast-john-pollard", "transcript": {"en": "So you just strained a muscle\nand the inflammation is unbearable. You wish you had something \nice-cold to dull the pain, but to use an ice pack, you would have had\nto put it in the freezer hours ago. Fortunately, there's another option. A cold pack can be left at room temperature\nuntil the moment you need it, then just snap it as instructed\nand within seconds you'll feel the chill. But how can something go from \nroom temperature to near freezing in such a short time? The answer lies in chemistry. Your cold pack contains water\nand a solid compound, usually ammonium nitrate, in different\ncompartments separated by a barrier. When the barrier is broken,\nthe solid dissolves causing what's known as an \nendothermic reaction, one that absorbs heat from its surroundings. To understand how this works, we need to look at the two driving forces\nbehind chemical processes: energetics and entropy. These determine whether a change occurs in\na system and how energy flows if it does. In chemistry, energetics deals with\nthe attractive and repulsive forces between particles at the molecular level. This scale is so small that there are\nmore water molecules in a single glass than there are known stars in the universe. And all of these trillions \nof molecules are constantly moving, vibrating \nand rotating at different rates. We can think of temperature as\na measurement of the average motion, or kinetic energy, of all these particles, with an increase in movement\nmeaning an increase in temperature, and vice versa. The flow of heat in any \nchemical transformation depends on the relative strength\nof particle interactions in each of a substance's chemical states. When particles have a strong mutual\nattractive force, they move rapidly towards one another,\nuntil they get so close, that repulsive forces push them away. If the initial attraction was \nstrong enough, the particles will keep vibrating back\nand forth in this way. The stronger the attraction,\nthe faster their movement, and since heat is essentially motion, when a substance changes to a state\nin which these interactions are stronger, the system heats up. But our cold packs do the opposite, which means that when \nthe solid dissolves in the water, the new interactions of solid particles \nand water molecules with each other are weaker than the separate interactions\nthat existed before. This makes both types of particles \nslow down on average, cooling the whole solution. But why would a substance change to a\nstate where the interactions were weaker? Wouldn't the stronger preexisting\ninteractions keep the solid from dissolving? This is where entropy comes in. Entropy basically describes \nhow objects and energy are distributed based on random motion. If you think of the air in a room,\nthere are many different possible arrangements for the trillions of particles \nthat compose it. Some of these will have all \nthe oxygen molecules in one area, and all the nitrogen molecules in another. But far more will have them \nmixed together, which is why air is always\nfound in this state. Now, if there are strong\nattractive forces between particles, the probability of some configurations\ncan change even to the point where the odds\ndon't favor certain substances mixing. Oil and water not mixing is an example. But in the case of the ammonium nitrate,\nor other substance in your cold pack, the attractive forces are not \nstrong enough to change the odds, and random motion makes the particles\ncomposing the solid separate by dissolving into the water\nand never returning to their solid state. To put it simply, your cold pack gets \ncold because random motion creates more configurations where \nthe solid and water mix together and all of these have even weaker\nparticle interaction, less overall particle movement, and less heat than there was \ninside the unused pack. So while the disorder that can result\nfrom entropy may have caused your injury\nin the first place, its also responsible for that\ncomforting cold that soothes your pain."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Energetics deal with:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The strength of attractive and repulsive forces between the substances"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The number of ways that a substance can arrange itself and distribute energy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Whether or not something dissolves in water"}, {"label": "D", "text": "why salt dissolves in water"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When a reaction is endothermic:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The product molecules have on average a lower kinetic energy than the reactant molecules"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The reactant molecules release heat when transforming into the product molecules"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The product molecules all move at the same speed and slower than the reactant molecules"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The reactant molecules are less energetically stable than the product molecules"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which best illustrates how many water molecules exist in a glass of water?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Every glass contains about an equal amount of water molecules as people on Earth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Every glass contains about an equal amount of molecules as insects on Earth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Every glass contains about an equal amount of molecules as blades of grass on a football field"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Every glass contains about an equal amount of molecules as the age of the universe in years times 750000"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Entropy is best described as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A measure of the strength of attractive forces between things"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A measure of how well something dissolves in water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A measure of the number of ways that the particles that make up a substance can be arranged and distribute energy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A measure of the weakness of attractive forces between things"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The main driving force that results in cold packs working is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The increase in the attractive forces between particles upon dissolving a solid"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The increase in the number of configurations available to the particles when a solid dissolves"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The decrease in the attractive forces between particles upon dissolving a solid"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The formation of a solid that occurs when the cold pack is cracked"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
