Rayor", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/ancient-greece-s-most-intriguing-erotic-poet-diane-j-rayor", "transcript": {"en": "More than 2,500 years ago, one of ancient Greece’s most celebrated \npopstars and erotic poets enraptured listeners. In one legend, a prominent Athenian heard\nhis nephew singing one of their songs and enjoyed it so much that he asked \nthe boy to teach it to him— “So that I may learn it and die,” he said. So, who was this revered figure? Her name was Sappho. She lived on the Greek island \nof Lesbos around 600 BCE. Like other singer-songwriters of the time, she sang while playing the lyre, a stringed instrument from which\nthe term “lyrics” is derived. But Sappho lyrics offered a uniquely\nintimate perspective on love, passion, and longing. She’s the first on record to combine the \nwords “bitter” and “sweet,” for instance, to describe at once the thrills \nand devastations of romance. Sappho was an aristocrat thought\nto have married a man, though none of her surviving\nwork mentions him. It does reference other family\nas well as festivals, colorful clothing, and growing old. But Sappho is best known for her lyrics\nabout homoerotic desire for women. In one song, as her female companion\ndeparts tearfully, Sappho says, “let me remind you /\n... the lovely times we shared.” She describes flower garlands, perfumes,\n“and,” she says, “on soft beds / \n... you quenched your desire.” In another, she describes \na friend in a distant city, “Pacing far away, her gentle heart\ndevoured by powerful desire, she remembers slender Atthis.” The word “Lesbian” means \nsomeone from Lesbos, but, because of Sappho, \nit now also describes a woman who’s gay. In ancient Greece, the norm was \nfor everyone to marry and have children. While men were usually permitted to have\nhomosexual relationships based on their status, \nwomen weren’t. But it appears that, \non Lesbos at this time, aristocratic women generally\nhad more freedom. Yet the details of Sappho’s\nlife remain mysterious, partially because only fragments \nof her poetry survive. In ancient times, however, \nso much of it persisted that it seemed it would last forever. Admirers performed Sappho cover songs\nand committed her poetry to papyrus, parchment, and pottery. Three centuries after Sappho’s death, a Greek author declared that her words\nwould endure “as long as ships sail from the Nile.” Another century later, the Library of  Alexandria housed \nnine scrolls of her work, numbering over 10,000 lines. But natural forces eroded the collection. And monks, tasked with preserving \nancient writing, likely neglected or destroyed her work. One 2nd century Christian leader \ncalled Sappho “a whore who sang about her\nown licentiousness.” Later, a Pope and Archbishop\nordered her poetry burned. Almost all of it had vanished\nby the Middle Ages. Then, about a century ago, people began rediscovering \nSappho’s poetry— in locations like an ancient Egyptian \ngarbage dump. Now, we have around 700 lines, representing less than 10%\nof Sappho’s total known work. We only have one complete poem of hers. About a dozen others are substantial,\nbut most are mere fragments. New pieces of Sappho’s songs \nprobably will be found. Some may already be sitting \nin museum archives, to be revealed when technology \nallows scholars to read through scrolls \ntoo fragile to unroll. What we are currently left \nwith is an incomplete record— and many historical rumors. Ovid insisted that Sappho fell \nin love with a ferryman and, upon being rejected,\nleapt from a cliff to her death. Another tale asserts that she ran \na girls’ school and those mentioned in her poems\nwere merely students for whom she felt platonic affection. Current consensus is that these stories, which ridicule Sappho \nor deny her work’s homoeroticism, are probably all untrue artifacts\nof misogyny and homophobia. Despite the distortions \nof the intervening millennia, Sappho’s words reach across time\nand resonate today. More than 2,000 years ago, she wrote: “I say someone in another time \nwill remember us” And, thankfully, we do."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Sappho lived in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Athens"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ithaca"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lesbos"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Santorini"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Sappho performed her songs with which instrument?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "flute"}, {"label": "B", "text": "harp"}, {"label": "C", "text": "lute"}, {"label": "D", "text": "lyre"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Sappho was best known for her lyrics about love for:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "men"}, {"label": "B", "text": "women"}, {"label": "C", "text": "nature"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the gods"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Of the nine scrolls of Sappho’s poetry collected in the Library of Alexandria in antiquity, about what percent survives today?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "less than 10"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50"}, {"label": "C", "text": "25"}, {"label": "D", "text": "75"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Fragments of Sappho’s poetry from antiquity are written on or in which of the following?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "handbooks"}, {"label": "B", "text": "papyrus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "parchment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pottery"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}
{"page": 1, "lesson": 2, "title": "Why I'm done trying to be \"man enough\" - Justin Baldoni", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/83OhjZcY", "transcript": {"en": "As an actor, I get scripts and it's my job to stay on script, to say my lines and bring to life a character\nthat someone else wrote. Over the course of my career, I've had the great honor playing some of the greatest\nmale role models ever represented on television. You might recognize me\nas \"Male Escort #1.\" (Laughter) \"Photographer Date Rapist,\" \"Shirtless Date Rapist\" from the award-winning\n\"Spring Break Shark Attack.\" (Laughter) \"Shirtless Medical Student,\" \"Shirtless Steroid-Using Con Man\" and, in my most\nwell-known role, as Rafael. (Applause) A brooding, reformed playboy who falls for, of all things, a virgin, and who is only occasionally shirtless. (Laughter) Now, these roles don't represent\nthe kind of man I am in my real life, but that's what I love about acting. I get to live inside characters\nvery different than myself. But every time I got\none of these roles, I was surprised, because most of the men\nI play ooze machismo, charisma and power, and when I look in the mirror,\nthat's just not how I see myself. But it was how Hollywood saw me, and over time, I noticed a parallel between the roles I would play as a man both on-screen and off. I've been pretending to be\na man that I'm not my entire life. I've been pretending\nto be strong when I felt weak, confident when I felt insecure and tough when really I was hurting. I think for the most part\nI've just been kind of putting on a show, but I'm tired of performing. And I can tell you right now that it is exhausting trying to be\nman enough for everyone all the time. Now -- right? (Laughter) My brother heard that. Now, for as long\nas I can remember, I've been told the kind of man\nthat I should grow up to be. As a boy, all I wanted was to be\naccepted and liked by the other boys, but that acceptance meant I had to acquire this almost disgusted view\nof the feminine, and since we were told that feminine\nis the opposite of masculine, I either had to reject\nembodying any of these qualities or face rejection myself. This is the script that we've been given. Right? Girls are weak,\nand boys are strong. This is what's being\nsubconsciously communicated to hundreds of millions of young boys\nand girls all over the world, just like it was with me. Well, I came here today to say, as a man that this is wrong, this is toxic, and it has to end. (Applause) Now, I'm not here\nto give a history lesson. We likely all know how we got here, OK? But I'm just a guy that woke up\nafter 30 years and realized that I was living in a state of conflict, conflict with who I feel I am in my core and conflict with who the world\ntells me as a man I should be. But I don't have a desire to fit into the current\nbroken definition of masculinity, because I don't just want\nto be a good man. I want to be a good human. And I believe the only way that can happen is if men learn to not only\nembrace the qualities that we were told\nare feminine in ourselves but to be willing to stand up, to champion and learn\nfrom the women who embody them. Now, men -- (Laughter) I am not saying that everything\nwe have learned is toxic. OK? I'm not saying there's anything\ninherently wrong with you or me, and men, I'm not saying\nwe have to stop being men. But we need balance, right? We need balance, and the only way things will change\nis if we take a real honest look at the scripts that have been\npassed down to us from generation to generation and the roles that,\nas men, we choose to take on in our everyday lives. So speaking of scripts, the first script I ever got\ncame from my dad. My dad is awesome. He's loving, he's kind,\nhe's sensitive, he's nurturing, he's here. (Applause) He's crying. (Laughter) But, sorry, Dad,\nas a kid I resented him for it, because I blamed him for making me soft, which wasn't welcomed\nin the small town in Oregon that we had moved to. Because being soft\nmeant that I was bullied. See, my dad wasn't\ntraditionally masculine, so he didn't teach me how to use my hands. He didn't teach me\nhow to hunt, how to fight, you know, man stuff. Instead he taught me what he knew: that being a man was about sacrifice and doing whatever you can to take care of\nand provide for your family. But there was another role\nI learned how to play from my dad, who, I discovered,\nlearned it from his dad, a state senator who later in life had to work nights as a janitor\nto support his family, and he never told a soul. That role was to suffer in secret. And now three generations later, I find myself playing that role, too. So why couldn't my grandfather\njust reach out to another man and ask for help? Why does my dad to this day still think\nhe's got to do it all on his own? I know a man who would rather die than tell another man\nthat they're hurting. But it's not because we're just all,\nlike, strong silent types. It's not. A lot of us men are really good\nat making friends, and talking, just not about anything real. (Laughter) If it's about work or sports\nor politics or women, we have no problem sharing our opinions, but if it's about\nour insecurities or our struggles, our fear of failure, then it's almost like we become paralyzed. At least, I do. So some of the ways\nthat I have been practicing breaking free of this behavior are by creating experiences\nthat force me to be vulnerable. So if there's something\nI'm experiencing shame around in my life, I practice diving straight into it, no matter how scary it is -- and sometimes, even publicly. Because then in doing so I take away its power, and my display of vulnerability can in some cases give other men\npermission to do the same. As an example, a little while ago I was wrestling with an issue in my life that I knew I needed\nto talk to my guy friends about, but I was so paralyzed by fear that they would judge me\nand see me as weak and I would lose my standing as a leader that I knew I had to take them\nout of town on a three-day guys trip -- (Laughter) Just to open up. And guess what? It wasn't until the end of the third day that I finally found\nthe strength to talk to them about what I was going through. But when I did,\nsomething amazing happened. I realized that I wasn't alone, because my guys had also been struggling. And as soon as I found the strength\nand the courage to share my shame, it was gone. Now, I've learned over time that if I want to practice vulnerability, then I need to build myself\na system of accountability. So I've been really blessed as an actor. I've built a really wonderful fan base, really, really sweet and engaged, and so I decided to use my social platform as kind of this Trojan horse wherein I could create a daily practice\nof authenticity and vulnerability. The response has been incredible. It's been affirming,\nit's been heartwarming. I get tons of love and press\nand positive messages daily. But it's all from a certain demographic: women. (Laughter) This is real. Why are only women following me? Where are the men? (Laughter) About a year ago, I posted this photo. Now, afterwards, I was scrolling\nthrough some of the comments, and I noticed that one of my female fans\nhad tagged her boyfriend in the picture, and her boyfriend responded by saying, \"Please stop tagging me in gay shit. Thx.\" (Laughter) As if being gay makes you\nless of a man, right? So I took a deep breath, and I responded. I said, very politely, that I was just curious, because I'm on an exploration\nof masculinity, and I wanted to know\nwhy my love for my wife qualified as gay shit. And then I said,\nhonestly I just wanted to learn. (Laughter) Now, he immediately wrote me back. I thought he was going to go off on me,\nbut instead he apologized. He told me how, growing up, public displays of affection\nwere looked down on. He told me that he was wrestling\nand struggling with his ego, and how much he loved his girlfriend and how thankful he was for her patience. And then a few weeks later, he messaged me again. This time he sent me a photo of him on one knee proposing. (Applause) And all he said was, \"Thank you.\" I've been this guy. I get it. See, publicly,\nhe was just playing his role, rejecting the feminine, right? But secretly he was waiting\nfor permission to express himself, to be seen, to be heard, and all he needed was another man holding him accountable\nand creating a safe space for him to feel, and the transformation was instant. I loved this experience, because it showed me\nthat transformation is possible, even over direct messages. So I wanted to figure out\nhow I could reach more men, but of course none of them\nwere following me. (Laughter) So I tried an experiment. I started posting more\nstereotypically masculine things -- (Laughter) Like my challenging workouts,\nmy meal plans, my journey to heal my body\nafter an injury. And guess what happened? Men started to write me. And then, out of the blue,\nfor the first time in my entire career, a male fitness magazine called me, and they said they wanted to honor me\nas one of their game-changers. (Laughter) Was that really game-changing? Or is it just conforming? And see, that's the problem. It's totally cool for men to follow me when I talk about guy stuff and I conform to gender norms. But if I talk about\nhow much I love my wife or my daughter or my 10-day-old son, how I believe that marriage\nis challenging but beautiful, or how as a man\nI struggle with body dysmorphia, or if I promote gender equality,\nthen only the women show up. Where are the men? So men, men, men, men! (Applause) I understand. Growing up, we tend\nto challenge each other. We've got to be the toughest, the strongest, the bravest\nmen that we can be. And for many of us, myself included,\nour identities are wrapped up in whether or not at the end of the day\nwe feel like we're man enough. But I've got a challenge for all the guys, because men love challenges. (Laughter) I challenge you to see\nif you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper into yourself. Your strength, your bravery,\nyour toughness: Can we redefine what those mean\nand use them to explore our hearts? Are you brave enough to be vulnerable? To reach out to another man\nwhen you need help? To dive headfirst into your shame? Are you strong enough to be sensitive, to cry whether you are hurting or you're happy, even if it makes you look weak? Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life? To hear their ideas and their solutions? To hold their anguish and actually believe them, even if what they're saying\nis against you? And will you be man enough to stand up to other men\nwhen you hear \"locker room talk,\" when you hear stories\nof sexual harassment? When you hear your boys talking\nabout grabbing ass or getting her drunk, will you actually stand up\nand do something so that one day\nwe don't have to live in a world where a woman has to risk everything and come forward\nto say the words \"me too?\" (Applause) This is serious stuff. I've had to take a real, honest look at the ways that I've unconsciously\nbeen hurting the women in my life, and it's ugly. My wife told me that I had been\nacting in a certain way that hurt her and not correcting it. Basically, sometimes\nwhen she would go to speak, at home or in public, I would just cut her off mid-sentence\nand finish her thought for her. It's awful. The worst part was that I was completely\nunaware when I was doing it. It was unconscious. So here I am doing my part, trying to be a feminist, amplifying the voices\nof women around the world, and yet at home, I am using my louder voice\nto silence the woman I love the most. So I had to ask myself a tough question: am I man enough to just shut the hell up and listen? (Laughter) (Applause) I've got to be honest.\nI wish that didn't get an applause. (Laughter) Guys, this is real. And I'm just scratching the surface here, because the deeper we go,\nthe uglier it gets, I guarantee you. I don't have time to get into porn\nand violence against women or the split of domestic duties or the gender pay gap. But I believe that as men, it's time we start to see\npast our privilege and recognize that we are\nnot just part of the problem. Fellas, we are the problem. The glass ceiling exists\nbecause we put it there, and if we want to be\na part of the solution, then words are no longer enough. There's a quote that I love that\nI grew up with from the Bahá'í writings. It says that \"the world of humanity\nis possessed of two wings, the male and the female. So long as these two wings\nare not equivalent in strength, the bird will not fly.\" So women, on behalf of men all over the world who feel similar to me, please forgive us for all the ways that we have not\nrelied on your strength. And now I would like\nto ask you to formally help us, because we cannot do this alone. We are men. We're going to mess up. We're going to say the wrong thing.\nWe're going to be tone-deaf. We're more than likely, probably,\ngoing to offend you. But don't lose hope. We're only here because of you, and like you, as men, we need\nto stand up and become your allies as you fight against pretty much everything. We need your help\nin celebrating our vulnerability and being patient with us as we make this very, very long journey from our heads to our hearts. And finally to parents: instead of teaching our children to be brave boys or pretty girls, can we maybe just teach them\nhow to be good humans? So back to my dad. Growing up, yeah, like every boy,\nI had my fair share of issues, but now I realize that it was\neven thanks to his sensitivity and emotional intelligence that I am able to stand here right now\ntalking to you in the first place. The resentment I had for my dad\nI now realize had nothing to do with him. It had everything to do with me\nand my longing to be accepted and to play a role\nthat was never meant for me. So while my dad may have not taught me\nhow to use my hands, he did teach me how to use my heart, and to me that makes him\nmore a man than anything. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But rather than employing\ntraditional instruments, Cage appeared surrounded \nby household clutter, including a bathtub, ice cubes,\na toy fish, a pressure cooker, a rubber duck, and several radios. Armed with these tools and a stopwatch,\nhe performed “Water Walk,” setting off a series of sounds\nwith a serious expression and incredible precision. Some viewers found\nthe performance hysterical, while others thought it was\ncompletely absurd. But most people watching likely shared \nthe same question: is this even music? This question is harder to answer\nthan you might think. What we determine as music often\ndepends on our expectations. For example, imagine you’re \nin a jazz club listening to the rhythmic honking of horns. Most people would agree\nthat this is music. But if you were on the highway hearing\nthe same thing, many would call it noise. After all, car horns aren’t instruments and these drivers aren’t \nmusicians... right? Expectations like these influence how\nwe categorize everything we hear. We typically think something sounds \nmore musical if it uses a recognizable structure \nor popular sounds arranged in well-known patterns. And even within the realm of music, we expect certain genres to use specific\ninstruments and harmonies. These expectations are based \non existing musical traditions, but those traditions aren't set in stone. They vary across different cultures\nand time periods. And in the early 20th century, when many artists were pushing \nthe boundaries of their fields, John Cage wanted to discover \nwhat new kinds of music might exist beyond those constraints. He began pioneering new instruments\nthat blurred the lines between art and everyday life, and used surprising objects to reinvent\nexisting instruments. He also explored new ways for music\nto mingle with other art forms. He and his creative and romantic partner,\nMerce Cunningham, held recitals where Cage’s music\nand Cunningham’s choreography would be created independently\nbefore being performed together. But whatever his approach, Cage gleefully dared listeners to question\nthe boundaries between music and noise, as well as sound and silence. Perhaps the best example is one of Cage’s\nmost famous compositions— a solo piano piece consisting of nothing\nbut musical rests for four minutes and 33 seconds. This wasn’t intended as a prank,\nbut rather, as a question. Could the opening and closing\nof a piano lid be music? What about the click of a stopwatch? The rustling, and perhaps even the\ncomplaining, of a crowd? Like the white canvases\nof his painting peers, Cage asked the audience to question \ntheir expectations about what music was. And while the piece didn’t evoke the drama\nof some traditional compositions, it certainly elicited a strong\nemotional response. Cage’s work frequently prioritized\nthese spontaneous, ephemeral experiences over precise, predictable performances. He even developed processes that left some\ncompositional decisions up to chance. One of his favorite such systems\nwas the I Ching, an ancient Chinese divination text. Using just a handful of coins, the I Ching allows readers \nto produce a pattern of lines which can be interpreted\nto answer questions and offer fortunes. But Cage adapted these patterns\ninto a series of tables that generated different musical \ndurations, tempos, and dynamics. Eventually, he even used early computers\nto help produce these random parameters. For some pieces, Cage went even further, offering musicians incomplete compositions\nnotated with broad instructions, allowing them to compose on the fly\nwith the help of his guidelines. Some composers rejected Cage's\nseemingly careless approach. They believed it was the composer’s job \nto organize sound and time for a specific, intentional purpose. After all, if these strange compositions \nwere music, then where do we draw the line? But like a bold explorer, Cage didn't\nwant to be bound by restrictions, and he certainly didn't want\nto follow old rules. He dedicated himself to shattering\nour expectations, creating a series\nof once in a lifetime experiences that continue encouraging \nmusicians and audiences to embrace the unexpected."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following “instruments” was used for the piece Water Walk?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A theremin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A rubber duck"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A tuba"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A cello"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What existing musical instrument did Cage reinvent?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The radio"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The piano"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The entire orchestra"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The bathtub"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "John Cage’s partner Merce Cunningham was a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "composer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "choreographer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "visual artist"}, {"label": "D", "text": "scientist"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the title of Cage’s well-known “silent” piece?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4’33”"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Water Walk"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Living Room Music"}, {"label": "D", "text": "0’00”"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Cage’s use of iChing in music is an example of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "improv music"}, {"label": "B", "text": "noise music"}, {"label": "C", "text": "chance music"}, {"label": "D", "text": "silent music"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

I'm 14 years old. And when I was 13, I convinced one of the largest toy companies, toy makers in the world, Hasbro, to change the way that they marketed one of their best-selling products. So, allow me to tell you about it. So, I have a brother, Gavin. When this whole shebang happened, he was four. He loved to cook. He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge and mixing them into these, needless to say, uneatable concoctions or making invisible macaroni and cheese. He wanted to be a chef really badly. And, so what better gift for someone, for a kid who wanted to be a chef, than an Easy Bake Oven, right? I mean, we all had those when we were little. And he wanted one so badly. But then, he started to realize something. In the commercials and on the boxes for the Easy Bake Oven, Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls. And the way that they did this was they would only feature girls on the boxes or in the commercials, and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens, and it would be in bright pink and purple. Very gender-specific colors to females, right? So, it kind of was sending a message that only girls are supposed to cook. Boys aren't. And this discouraged my brother a lot. He thought that he wasn't supposed to want to be a chef. because that was something girls did. Girls cooked, boys didn't. Or so, the message that Hasbro was sending. And this got me thinking, \"God, I wish there was a way I could change this, that I could have my voice heard by Hasbro, so I could ask them and tell them what they were doing wrong and ask them to change it.\" And that got me thinking about a website that I had learned about a few months prior called Change.org. Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform, where you can create a petition and share it across all these social media networks, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever you can think of. And so, I created a petition, along with a YouTube video that I added to the petition, basically asking Hasbro to change the way that they marketed it, in featuring boys in the commercials and on the boxes, and most of all creating them in less gender-specific colors. So, this petititon started to take off, like humongously fast, you have no idea. I was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets, and it was amazing. In three weeks, maybe three and a half, I had 46,000 signatures on this petition. (Applause) Thank you. So, needless to say, it was crazy. Eventually, Hasbro themselves invited me to their headquarters so they could go and unveil their new Easy Bake Oven product to me, in black, silver and blue. It was literally one of the best moments of my life. It was like \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\" That thing was amazing. What I didn't realize at the time, however, was that I had become an activist. I could change something that, even as a kid, or maybe even especially as a kid, my voice mattered. And your voice matters, too! I want to let you know that it's not going to be easy, and it wasn't easy for me because I faced a lot of obstacles. People online, and sometimes even in real life, were disrespectful to me and my family and talked about how the whole thing was a waste of time, and it really discouraged me. And actually, I have some examples because what's better revenge than displaying their idiocy? So, let's see. From username Liquidsword29, interesting usernames we have here, \"Disgusting liberal moms making their son's gay.\" Liquidsword29, really? Really? Okay, how about from Whiteboy77AGS, \"People always need something to 'female dog' about.\" From Jeffrey Gutierrez, \"OMG shut up! You just want money and attention.\" So, it was comments like these that really discouraged me from wanting to make change in the future because I thought, \"People don't care. People think it's a waste of time. And people are going to be disrespectful to me and my family.\" It hurt me. And it made me think, \"What's the point in making change in the future?\" But then I started to realize something. Haters gonna hate. Come on, say it with me! One, two, three, Haters gonna hate! So let your haters hate, you know what! And make your change because I know you can. I look out into this crowd, and I see 400 people who came out because they wanted to know how they could make a change. And I know that you can, and all of you watching at home can, too, because you have so much that you can do and that you believe in. And you can trade it across all the social media, through Facebook, through Twitter, through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr, through whatever else you can think of. And you can make that change. You can take what you believe in and turn it into a cause and change it. And that spark that you've been hearing about all day today you can use that spark that you have within you and turn it into a fire. Thank you.

But as he embarked on yet another life \nrunning a camera shop in San Francisco, he already found himself distracted. From the Watergate hearings \non national news, to the teacher who had to rent a projector\nwhen her school couldn’t afford one, Harvey saw a desperate need \nfor political reform. Milk strongly believed that tight knit \nneighborhoods were essential to the fabric of the city, and that government should solve those \ncommunity’s most practical problems. From fixing potholes and putting \nup stop signs, to promoting a friendly culture \nof cooperation, Milk envisioned a more personal \napproach to local government. This philosophy led him to run \nfor the city’s Board of Supervisors as the representative \nfor his own district, which included the heart of \nAmerican gay culture, the Castro. At this time, police brutality, \ndiscrimination and media stereotyping plagued the LGBT community, labeling Harvey and his supporters as \npolitical outsiders. But Milk refused to \ndownplay his sexuality. He was sure that gay rights could never \nbe won from the closet, and he saw the Castro as one of many minorities without \nrepresentation in city politics. Milk was determined to bring these \nbasic government services to all of San Francisco’s disenfranchised \ngroups, regardless of race, age, or sexuality. But despite his flair for public speaking and open-hearted approach, voters couldn’t see Milk’s radical vision. In 1973, he lost his first bid for \nthe Board of Supervisors. In 1975, he lost again. A year later, he ran for the California \nAssembly– and lost. Yet he tirelessly continued \nto support his district, befriending bartenders, construction \nunions, and local Chinese grocers. This earned him the affectionate title, \nthe \"mayor of Castro Street.” And when he ran his third campaign for \nthe Board of Supervisors in 1977, Harvey finally won the seat– becoming one of the first openly gay \npublic officials in US history. Elated, Milk arrived in office determined \nto make lasting change. He immediately introduced a bill outlawing\ndiscrimination on the grounds of sexuality and launched a major clean-up of the city. But not everyone was happy \nwith this direction. Anti-gay sentiment was gaining national \nmomentum, especially in the form of \nCalifornia’s Proposition 6. The proposition, which sought \nto make it illegal for homosexuals to work \nin Californian schools, would prove to be the biggest battle \nof Milk’s career. Supporters of Prop 6 attacked \nthe LGBT community, calling them unfit to work with students. But Milk urged them not to hide in fear: “Come out to your relatives. Come out to your friends, \nif indeed they are your friends. Come out to your neighbors, \nto your fellow workers… break down the myths. Destroy the lies and distortions. For your sake. For their sake.” Alongside other activists, he ran an incandescent campaign \nagainst hate. On November 7, 1978, Prop 6 was defeated in a landslide. It was proof that Milk’s message was \ngaining traction. But just twenty days after this \ninspiring victory, he was assassinated at City Hall– killed alongside San Francisco \nMayor George Moscone. Both men had been murdered by Dan White, a former fellow supervisor, who had positioned himself against those \nhe called \"radicals, social deviates and incorrigibles.” He had frequently clashed with Harvey \nat Board meetings, and resented the spirit of change \nwhich Milk personified for many. The night of Milk's murder, thousands marched by candlelight \nthrough the city. In the wake of this tragedy, yet another injustice arose. In a highly controversial verdict, White received a sentence of only seven \nyears and eight months– a decision that sparked uproar \nthroughout the city in what became known as \nthe White Night Riots. But even after his death, Milk continued to preach \nhis hopeful cause. He left his friends and followers a total \nof three different tapes to be played in the event \nof his assassination. They leave us with a call to action, and a reminder that everyone is welcome\nin the fight against injustice: \"I ask for the movement to continue… and if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy \nevery closet door…”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many times did Harvey Milk run for public office before he was finally elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What jobs did Harvey Milk hold before he was elected to public office?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Teacher"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Naval Officer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Actor"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In what year was Harvey Milk elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1982"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2005"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1977"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1969"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Harvey Milk championed civil rights for:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "African Americans"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Latinos"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gay people"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Harvey Milk believed that gay youth should", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "be treated in conversion therapy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ignore their sexual orientation until they turn 21"}, {"label": "C", "text": "be helped by gay adults to fight the prejudice and discrimination against them"}, {"label": "D", "text": "be prohibited from joining gay rights organizations"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

At the age of 17, she’d been \nseparated from her family and taken to William Neyland’s \nTexas Plantation. There, she was made to do housework \nat the violent whims of her enslavers. On that fateful day, she learned that\nslavery had recently been abolished, but Neyland conspired to keep \nthis a secret from those he enslaved. Hearing this, Brooks stepped out of her\nhiding spot, proclaimed her freedom, spread the news throughout the plantation,\nand ran. That night, she returned\nfor her daughter, Tempie. And before Neyland’s spiteful bullets\ncould find them, they were gone for good. For more than two centuries, slavery defined what would become \nthe United States— from its past as the 13 British colonies \nto its growth as an independent country. Slavery fueled its cotton industry \nand made it a leading economic power. 10 of the first 12 presidents\nenslaved people. And when US chattel slavery finally ended, it was a long and uneven process. Enslaved people resisted \nfrom the beginning— by escaping, breaking tools, \nstaging rebellions, and more. During the American Revolution, Vermont\nand Massachusetts abolished slavery while several states took steps\ntowards gradual abolition. In 1808, federal law banned the import\nof enslaved African people, but it allowed the slave trade\nto continue domestically. Approximately 4 million people\nwere enslaved in the US when Abraham Lincoln was\nelected president in 1860. Lincoln opposed slavery, \nand though he had no plans to outlaw it, his election caused panic \nin Southern states, which began withdrawing from the Union. they vowed to uphold slavery\nand formed the Confederacy, triggering the start \nof the American Civil War. A year into the conflict, Lincoln\nabolished slavery in Washington, D.C., legally freeing more than 3,000 people. And five months later, he announced\nthe Emancipation Proclamation. It promised freedom to the 3.5 million\npeople enslaved in Confederate states. But it would only be fulfilled if the\nrebelling states didn’t rejoin the Union by January 1st, 1863. And it bore no mention of the roughly\n500,000 people in bondage in the border states of Delaware,\nMaryland, Kentucky, and Missouri that hadn’t seceded. When the Confederacy refused to surrender, Union soldiers began \nannouncing emancipation. But many Southern areas remained\nunder Confederate control, making it impossible to actually implement\nabolition throughout the South. The war raged on for two more years,\nand on January 31st, 1865, Congress passed the 13th Amendment. It promised to end slavery\nthroughout the US— except as punishment for a crime. But to go into effect, 27 states\nwould have to ratify it first. Meanwhile, the Civil War\nvirtually ended with the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee\non April 9th, 1865. But although slavery was technically\nillegal in all Southern states, it still persisted in the last\nbastions of the Confederacy. There, enslavers like Neyland continued\nto evade abolition until forced. This was also the case when Union General\nGordon Granger marched his troops into Galveston, Texas, on June 19th and announced that all enslaved people\nthere were officially free— and had been for more than two years. Still, at this point, people remained \nlegally enslaved in the border states. It wasn’t until more than five months\nlater, on December 6th, 1865, that the 13th Amendment\nwas finally ratified. This formally ended chattel slavery\nin the US. Because official emancipation\nwas a staggered process, people in different places commemorated\nit on different dates. Those in Galveston, Texas, began\ncelebrating “Juneteenth”— a combination of “June” and “nineteenth”— on the very first anniversary \nof General Granger’s announcement. Over time, smaller Juneteenth gatherings\ngave way to large parades. And the tradition eventually became the most widespread \nof emancipation celebrations. But, while chattel slavery \nhad officially ended, racial inequality, oppression,\nand terror had not. Celebrating emancipation was itself\nan act of continued resistance. And it wasn't until 2021 that Juneteenth\nbecame a federal holiday. Today, Juneteenth holds profound\nsignificance as a celebration of the demise of slavery, the righteous\npursuit of true freedom for all, and a continued pledge to remember\nthe past and dream the future."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "American President Abraham Lincoln personally opposed slavery, but did he have specific plans to abolish the practice when he was elected in 1860?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Approximately how many enslaved people were living in the United States at the onset of the Civil War?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 million "}, {"label": "B", "text": "2 million "}, {"label": "C", "text": "3 million"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4 million"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The Thirteenth Amendment was passed on December 6, 1865, finally ending chattel slavery.

We learn how to tell ourselves off for our failures and for not working hard or smart enough. But so good are we at this that we're sometimes in danger of falling prey to an excessive form of self-criticism What we might call self-flagellation a rather dangerous state which just ushers in depression and under-performance. We might simply lose the will to get out of bed. For those moments, we need a corrective. We need to carve out time for an emotional state of which many of us are profoundly suspicious. Self-compassion. We're suspicious because that sounds horribly close to self-pity But because depression and self-hatred are serious enemies of a good life, we need to appreciate the role of self-care in a good, ambitious and fruitful life. To this end we can perform what we've called a, \"self-compassion exercise\" A structured meditation, lasting 15 minutes or so Lying in bed, or perhaps a bath Turn over a sequence of thoughts that interrupt and correct the flow of your worse self-accusations. For a time adopt an entire kindly perspective on your setbacks The self compassion exercise goes like this: We're so in love with success we fail to notice the scale of the challenges we routinely set ourselves. There is nothing remotely normal about what we've tried to achieve. We've failed, but given the mountain we were trying to climb, the conclusion doesn't have to be that we're simply flawless. We have tricky family histories, we all do. There were things which happened to us at the hands of others which can help to explain some of our current troubles. We're not entirely sane or well, but none of us are. We weren't well set up to carry out certain tasks It isn't wholly our fault in the here and now. From the media, you'd think everyone was rich and famous and successful. But in reality, undramatic, quiet failure is by a huge margin the statistical norm. We shouldn't tear ourselves apart for not managing to be to what were in truth, awesome odds. Tough, self-critical people don't allow themselves the indulgence of believing in luck. They take responsibility for everything. They think winners make their own luck But they don't for the most part. Luck is a genuine feature of existence We're robbing ourselves of fair concilation By believing that we're entirely in control, and therefore entirely to blame when we crash. You are not only your achievements. Status and material success are one bit of you. But there are others as well, those who loved you in childhood knew this, and in their best moments helped you to feel it. Rehearse the internalized voices of all those who have been kind to you. Bathe in the memory of a laugh independent of achievement. It seems it will never end That's not the truth It's just how a crisis feels. You need to reduce expectations to zero for a time.

{"page": 1, "lesson": 9, "title": "How quickly do you judge a face?", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/eWW4ALDt", "transcript": {"en": "LUKE GROSKIN: How quickly do\nyou judge someone by their face? Don't deny it. We all do it. The question is, how fast. Care to find out? JOHN FREEMAN: I'm John Freeman. And I study how the brain\nextracts information from faces. LUKE GROSKIN: See? You're doing it right now. JOHN FREEMAN: Faces are\nspecial in the sense that they provide really\nsignificant information about other people\nwithin 100 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: That's faster\nthan the blink of an eye. JOHN FREEMAN: Information\nfrom the retina about a face travels back to the\nearly visual cortex, to the back of the brain. And then it's sent forward\nthrough the rest of the brain. LUKE GROSKIN: To be\nanalyzed and scrutinized by different and dedicated\nregions of your brain. That you can look at a\nface for less than a second and assess gender, race,\nage, emotional state is an evolutionary feat. JOHN FREEMAN: Now, it's\nalso interesting to consider why we may have mechanisms\nin place to judge personality traits. LUKE GROSKIN: Just as quickly. To understand exactly how\nwe make these snap character assessments, using an fMRI\nmachine is, well, a no-brainer. JOHN FREEMAN: When\nneurons in a brain region start to activate more,\noxygen and glucose have to rapidly flow in. And using fMRI,\nthey'll highlight with colors what\nbrain regions are involved in a\nparticular kind of task or correlated with some\nkind of perception. LUKE GROSKIN: For example,\nif you perceive a face, your fusiform cortex\nwill light up. JOHN FREEMAN: It's thought\nto be an evolutionarily dedicated mechanism for faces. LUKE GROSKIN: Now, if you\nthink the owner of that face may help you or harm\nyou, another part of your brain known as the\namygdala will react as well. JOHN FREEMAN: It processes\nfearful expressions of other people. It's involved in motivating\nrapid responses to threaten stimuli, for example. LUKE GROSKIN: It's also\nan extremely fast judge of trustworthiness. JOHN FREEMAN: We'll put\nsubjects into the scanner and then present faces that\nvary in trustworthiness for 33 milliseconds. LUKE GROSKIN: Here's what\n33 milliseconds of a face looks like. Did you catch that? No worries if you didn't. The test subjects didn't either. And they didn't even\nknow it was coming. JOHN FREEMAN: So within\nthose 33 milliseconds we presented a face, it\nhit early visual cortex and started feeding forward\nand was able to, in this case, modulate amygdala responses. LUKE GROSKIN: But the\npart of the brain that helps you to\nactually consciously see that face, the fusiform\ncortex, wasn't activated. JOHN FREEMAN: So it suggests\nthat the brain can process the trustworthiness\nof a face without even perceptual awareness, so without\neven being aware that a face is being presented. LUKE GROSKIN: The exact\nneurological mechanisms that allow us to judge a face\nbefore we can consciously see it have yet to be discovered. But Dr. Freeman is\ninclined to believe that our rapidly responsive\namygdala could just be tinting our view. JOHN FREEMAN: Even on an\nemotionally neutral face, we see a subtle\nresemblance to an emotion and then run with\nthat hypothesis. So one idea is that a lot of\nthese personality judgments that we make quite\nspontaneously are bleeding over from emotion perception. LUKE GROSKIN: And\ntrustworthiness isn't the only type\nof snap judgment that can be altered\nby tiny facial cues. It happens with\ngender perception too. Using software that\ntracks the computer mouse movements of people\nasked to judge a face, Dr. Freeman could determine\nhow we perceive that face. JOHN FREEMAN: So for example,\nif we take a standard male face and make it very slightly\nfeminine using computer morphing, what we'll see is\nthat even though they ultimately select male response,\nthey will be partially, simultaneously\nattracted to select female response on the\nopposite side of the screen. LUKE GROSKIN: This swerve\ntowards the female-gendered response represents the\nsubjects' preconceptions of what a male face looks like. And while it only lasts\na few milliseconds, it can have real\nworld consequences. JOHN FREEMAN: What we did was\nwe presented male and female politicians' faces. So these are real\npoliticians' faces. And what we showed\nwas that that kind of slight swinging towards a\nmale response before hitting female was\nsignificantly predictive of her electoral\nfailure, particularly in conservative states. LUKE GROSKIN: Evidence that\nany politician's appearance can affect their electability\nshouldn't surprise you. That a split second look at\na female politician's face might influence your vote\nshould give you pause. JOHN FREEMAN: Seeing\nhow subtle the cues are that we use to infer so\nmany important, meaningful characteristics\nabout another person and how powerful these\njudgments are, I think, is something that's\nreally startling. LUKE GROSKIN: Knowing how\npowerful a first impression can be just might make you think\ntwice before you judge a face.

The group lived on a grassy island, and we had to isolate him in a cage, but we cracked open the cage\nso that the rest of the chimps still had access to him. And what happened was most touching. Other chimps would bring food to him, they would bring wood wool to him, which is this thing that they use\nto sleep in and build nests out of, and females would put\nthe wood wool behind his back. He was leaning heavily against the wall, and the way we do with pillows\nto patients in a hospital, they were putting\nthat stuff behind his back. And I thought, this is the way\nto go for an alpha male. He was loved and respected,\nand everyone was taking care of him, and this is not always how it goes, because some males don't end so well\nwhen they lose their position. So Amos was an example\nof a male who was liked as a leader, and I think the term alpha male,\nif you look it up on the internet, you will find all these business books\nthat tell you how to be an alpha male, and what they mean\nis how to beat up others and beat them over the head\nand let them know that you are boss and don't mess with me and so on. And basically an alpha male\nfor them is a bully. And I really don't like\nthat kind of description, because I am actually partly responsible\nfor the term \"alpha male\" because I wrote this book\n\"Chimpanzee Politics,\" which was recommended by Newt Gingrich\nto freshmen congressmen. I don't know what good it did,\nbut he recommended that book to them, and after that the term\n\"alpha male\" became very popular. But I think it is used\nin a mischaracterization. It's used in a very superficial way that doesn't relate\nto what a real alpha male is. And so I'm here to explain what that is. The term itself goes back\nactually much further. It goes back to the '40s and '50s,\nresearch on wolves, and basically the definition\nis very simple. The highest ranking male\nis the alpha male. The highest ranking female\nis the alpha female. Every primate group\nhas one alpha male, one alpha female, not more than that, there's only one. And I will explain how that goes. So first, the body language. What you see here is two male chimpanzees\nwho are the same size, but one is walking upright,\nhas his hair up, has a big rock in his hand,\nand he's the alpha male. The other male is pant-grunting to him, is being submissive to him\nand bowing for him, and that is the sort of ritual they need\nto go through many times a day in order to have a stable relationship. I'll show you a video from the field. What you will see here\nis a female pant-grunting to an alpha male and you will see how that goes. The male is approaching, she grunts at him. (Chimpanzee grunts) He has all his hair up and he displays. I'm actually standing far too close. A chimpanzee is far stronger than I am, and I just was not very prudent,\nthis particular video. So what you saw him do is he was lifting himself up\nand standing on two legs, and putting his arms out. That's called the bipedal swagger. It's a very common posture\nin high-ranking males, and it's very recognizable\nbecause humans do this kind of stuff. (Laughter) Humans do this all the time. And what I really like\nabout this particular picture is the two old guys to the side. This is very chimpanzee. In chimpanzees, we have usually old males\nwho are over the hill, who cannot be alpha male\nthemselves anymore, but they start playing games\nand forming coalitions, and behind the backs of others. And they become extremely influential, and you may actually have old males who are more influential\nthan the alpha male himself. Just as an example, the three males\nthat I used to work with most at the Dutch zoo long ago, where I worked, and the middle male here\nis a 17-year-old alpha male. The male whom he is grooming\non the side is twice as old, and this old male has made him the leader. So you can imagine that that old male\nhas an enormous amount of power, because he has made\nthe alpha male alpha male. The male on the right is individually the strongest male. In captivity, you can test it out, and you can know that this male\nhas no trouble with either one. He has only trouble\nwith the combination of the two. And so the coalition formation\nthat goes on in chimpanzee society makes it much more complex than you think. It means, for example, that the smallest male in a group\ncan be the alpha male. You don't need to be\nthe biggest and strongest male. The smallest male, if he has\nthe right friends and keeps them happy, or he has female support, he can be the alpha male. So the coalition system\nmakes everything complex, and I'm always waiting here in the US for the primaries,\nthe end of the primaries, because that's a moment\nwhere you need to demonstrate unity. Now let me first show you\nhow the unity is shown in chimpanzees. What you see here is two males on the left who are standing together. You also see the big\ncanine teeth that they have. And they're standing together and they\ndemonstrate to the rest of the group, \"We are together. We are a unit.\" The males on the right\nare walking together in synchrony. That's another way of demonstrating\nthat you are together. And so demonstrating unity\nis extremely important in a coalition system, and as I said, in the primaries\nalways I'm waiting for that moment because then you have\ntwo members of the same party who have been fighting with each other, and they need to come\ntogether at some moment. And it leads to very awkward situations. People who don't like each other\nneed to embrace each other and stand together, and that's absolutely essential\nfor the unity of the party, and if you don't do that,\nthe party may fall apart. And so if it doesn't go well,\nlike in this particular case -- (Laughter) then the party is in deep doo-doo because they have not demonstrated unity. So that's a very important part\nof the coalition system, and that's something that we share\nbetween humans and chimpanzees. Now, how do you become an alpha male? First of all, you need to be\nimpressive and intimidating and demonstrate your vigor on occasion and show that you are very strong, and there's all sorts\nof ways of doing that. But other things that you need to do\nis you need to be generous. So, for example,\nmales who go on a campaign to dethrone the leader, which may take two or three months where they're testing\nall the coalitions in the group, they also become extremely generous. They share food very easily with everyone. Or they start to tickle\nthe babies of the females. They're normally, male chimpanzees,\nnot particularly interested in infants, but when they are campaigning like that, they get very interested in infants\nand they tickle them, and they try to curry favor\nwith the females. (Laughter) So in humans, of course, I am always intrigued\nby these men who are candidates and hold babies up like this. This is not particularly\nsomething that babies like -- (Laughter) but since it is a signal\nto the rest of the world, they need to hold them in the air. And I was really intrigued by, when we had a female candidate\nin the last election, the way she held babies\nwas more like this, which is what babies really like. But she of course\ndidn't need to send the message that she could hold a baby\nwithout dropping it, which was what the man was doing. So this is a very common tactic, and male chimpanzees, they spend a lot of time\ncurrying favor with all sorts of parties when they are campaigning. Now, what are the privileges and the costs of being an alpha male? The biggest privilege is females. Food is really irrelevant. Male chimpanzees\ncan go a week without food if there's a female in estrus\nand they're sexually interested in her. Food is secondary to sex. And so the male chimpanzees -- and we evolutionary biologists, of course,\nwe have an explanation for this, is that sex leads to reproduction, and reproductive success\nis the measure of evolution. That's how everything evolves. And so if males can enhance\ntheir reproductive success by being high ranking, you get automatically the ambition\nto be high ranking in the males. So that's the privilege. The costs, one cost is of course that you need to keep your partners happy. So if you come to power\nwith the support of an old male, you need to let that old male\nmate with females. If you don't do that,\nthat old male is going to get mad at you, and you're going to lose him as a partner. So there's a transaction going on. If you become alpha male this way,\nyou need to keep your partners happy. And so that's one of the costs. The second cost is that\neveryone wants your position. Alpha male position\nis a very important position, and everyone wants to take it from you, and so you constantly\nhave to watch your back. You have to be extremely vigilant. For example, you have to\ndisrupt the coalitions of others and that's what male\nchimpanzees do quite a bit. Divide and rule strategies, they have. And so that's a very stressful situation,\nand we actually have data on this. The data comes from the field, from baboons not chimpanzees in this case, where they did fecal samples\non the baboons and they analyzed them\nfor glucocorticoids. And what you see here is a graph where you see that the lower ranking\nthe male baboon is, the higher is his cortisol level in the feces, but the alpha male, as you see, has just as high a level\nas the lowest-ranking males, and so you may think that being alpha male\nis nice and dandy and is wonderful, but it's actually\na very stressful position, and we can demonstrate\nthat physiologically. Now, what are the obligations? And here, for me,\nit gets really interesting, and it deviates very much\nfrom your typical image of the alpha male. The alpha male\nhas two sorts of obligations. One is to keep the peace in the group. We call that the control role, to control fights in the group, and the second is to be the most empathic, the consoler in chief, basically,\nof the nation, so to speak. So first of all, keeping the peace. This is a male who stops a fight\nbetween two females. Two females on the left and the right have been screaming and yelling\nat each other over food, because food is very\nimportant for the females, and so he stops the fight between them\nand stands between them like this. And it's very interesting to me\nthat alpha males, when they do this, they become impartial. They don't support their mom\nor their best buddy. No, no, they stop fights, and they come up\nfor the underdog in general. And this makes them\nextremely popular in the group, because they provide security for the lowest-ranking\nmembers of the group. And so they become impartial, which is an unusual condition\nfor a chimpanzee to be in, because they're usually\nvery fond of their friends and so on, and these alpha males\nwho are good at this, they can be very effective\nat keeping the peace in the group. And the second thing they do\nis they show empathy for others. Now, I do an enormous amount\nof research on empathy, and I don't have time to go into it, but empathy is nowadays a topic\nthat we study in rodents and dogs and elephants and primates, all sorts of animals. And what you see here is two bonobos. The one in front has been beaten up in a fight. The one in the back puts\nher arms around her and consoles her. This is also actually how we measure\nempathy in young children, by looking at how they respond\nto distressed individuals. And high-ranking males,\nthey do a lot of this. High-ranking males provide an enormous\namount of comfort in the group, and they go to places\nwhere there are earthquakes or hurricanes and they provide comfort. The pope does this.\nThe presidents do this. All the leaders in the world\nhave to do this job. The queen does it and so on. They all have to do this job, so providing consolation,\nand that's a very important task. And males who are good at these two, keeping the peace and providing comfort, they become extremely popular leaders, and there's actually\nsome self-interest involved in it. They don't do it just for the group, because it also stabilizes their position. The more popular\na male becomes as alpha male and the more the rest of them\nrespects them and looks up to them, the better their position is defended in case it's going to be\nchallenged by somebody else, because then, of course, the whole group\nis going to support that male because they want to keep\na leader who is good for them. So the group is usually very supportive\nof males who are good leaders, and it's not supportive at all of bullies. And when bullies lose their position, they may end up\nin a very bad situation there. This is data actually\non the consolation behavior. This is data on consolation\nin chimpanzees, and you see for the medium-\nand low-ranking individuals, the females do more of it than the males. This is basically the whole community. And this is true for all\nthe mammal studies on empathy is that females\nhave more of it than males. But look at the alpha male. The alpha male does\nfar more than anybody else. And so that's the data on alpha males\nbeing the consoler in chief, basically. The last thing I want to say\nis something about alpha females. This is a picture of Mama,\nthe alpha female in the Arnhem zoo where I used to work, who is now all over the internet, I think a hundred million\nclicks at the moment, for a video of her dying at the age of 59, which happened last year. And Mama was an absolute\ncentrum of the group. So she was not physically capable\nof dominating the males. She ranked below the males,\nbut she was the center of the community, and if there was big trouble\nin the community, everyone would end up in the arms of Mama. And so she was a very important figure. And so I don't want to minimize\nthe position of alpha females in the chimpanzee group. And then we have a species\nthat is equally close to us as the chimpanzee, the bonobo. We often forget about the bonobo,\nbut the bonobos have a matriarchal society and the alpha individual\nis a female, generally. Generally, it's a female\nwho is at the top of the community, and we know much less\nabout how this is done and how they get to that position,\nand what they do with it, because we know much less\nabout bonobos in general. But I do want to emphasize that the alpha in a group\ndoesn't need to be a male, and that actually in one\nof our close relatives, it is a female. So the message I want to leave you with is that if you are looking\nat men in our society who are the boss of, let's say, a family or a business\nor Washington or whatever, you call them alpha male, you should not insult chimpanzees by using the wrong label. (Laughter) You should not call a bully an alpha male. Someone who is big and strong\nand intimidates and insults everyone is not necessarily an alpha male. An alpha male has all sorts of qualities, and I have seen bully\nalpha males in chimpanzees, they do occur, but most of the ones that we have have leadership capacities and are integrated in their community, and, like Amos at the end, they are loved and respected, and so it's a very different situation\nthan you may think. And I thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

At first glance, this painting may appear \nto be an impossible, abstract image. But a closer look reveals \nthe tender stems, lush petals and velvety texture \nof a Canna Lily. This metamorphosis of natural subjects\ninto abstract geometry is commonplace in the work \nof Georgia O’Keeffe— the revolutionary American painter \nand sculptor. But the magic behind \nthis transformation remains just as elusive as the artist herself. Born in Wisconsin in 1887, O’Keeffe spent\nher childhood plucking wildflowers and arranging fruits to paint. At seventeen, she moved to Chicago \nto study at the prestigious Art Institute. Her teachers trained her \nto faithfully reproduce reality in the conventions of European masters. Although she enjoyed the solitude \nand precision of this work, O’Keeffe felt little \npersonal connection to it. After moving to New York, she was \nincreasingly drawn to the clean lines, striking composition and vivid colors \nof Japanese art. O’Keeffe soon found a teacher \nwhose lessons inspired her to put those interests into practice. Unlike her previous teachers, Arthur Wesley Dow urged his students\nto focus on more abstract representations of light, shape, and color. These lessons manifested in O’Keeffe’s\nfirst series of abstract drawings. Rendered in charcoal, they present \na series of undulating lines, bold shading and billowing clouds. These drawings defy easy classification— suggesting, but never quite matching,\nany specific natural reference. Earlier European painters \nin the Cubist tradition had employed rigid geometry\nto abstract external subjects. But here, O’Keeffe employed \nthe shapes and rhythms of nature to capture her internal feelings. Experiments like these \nwould soon become a cornerstone of an artistic movement \ncalled American Modernism. Although no single style defines \nModernist painting, its proponents shared a desire \nto challenge the realist traditions that dominated art education. Beginning in the late 1910’s, \nModernist painting often used geometric shapes \nand bold colors to probe the American psyche. O’Keeffe threw herself \ninto these experiments — but she was reluctant \nto share her new work. However, when a friend sent her charcoals\nto the art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, he became entranced. In 1916, he arranged \nfor a grand exhibition in New York. This marked the beginning of O’Keeffe’s\ncareer as a popular artist— and a relationship that would lead \nto marriage in 1924. Marriage didn’t diminish O’Keeffe’s\ntaste for solitude. She travelled widely to teach, and often retreated to paint \nfor months at a time. Whether she was exploring \nthe craggy canyons of Texas, the quiet forests of South Carolina, \nor the sun-bleached desert of New Mexico, her creative process was based on \nritual and close observation. She paid meticulous attention \nto small details, and spent hours mixing paints \nto create exactly the right colors. When she found the perfect hue,\nshe’d record it in her ever-growing collection\nof handmade color cards. O’Keeffe also experimented \nwith perspective to celebrate objects that were often overlooked. In \"Rams Head with Hollyhock,\" she places a weathered skull \nand a delicate flower high above the hills below. This massive skull overshadows \nthe landscape, casting both the skeleton \nand the mountains in a new, eerie light. The public was captivated by her \nunique perspective and secretive behavior. She was particularly praised \nfor her massive flower paintings, ranging from fiery poppies \nto ghostly calla lillies. Stieglitz and other critics of the time \nwere infatuated by Freudian psychology, and were quick to link these paintings\nto female genitalia. But O’Keeffe dismissed \nsuch interpretations. She resented the male gaze \nthat dominated the art world, and demanded her work be respected for its emotional evocation \nof the natural world. Eventually, O’Keeffe settled down \nin New Mexico, near one of her favorite artist retreats. In her 70’s, her eyesight began to fail, but she continued to mine the landscape’s\nmysteries in new, tactile mediums. O’Keeffe kept creating \nuntil her death at 98, and is remembered as \nthe “Mother of American Modernism.” Decades on, her work retains \nits wild energy— and O’Keeffe her personal mystique."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Georgia O’Keefe was born in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "New Mexico"}, {"label": "B", "text": "New York"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chicago"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wisconsin"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "At the art institute, she was taught to paint in which of the following styles?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Her own personal style"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Realism, or the faithful representation of reality"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cubism, or the representation of objects through geometric shapes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Later, she became drawn to the principles of abstract art, which focused on:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Human bodies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Realistic still lives"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Light, shape and colour"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "O’Keefe magnified elements of the natural world to bring our attention to objects we often overlook.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "O’Keefe often painted found objects, including:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Flowers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bones"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Leaves"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

The subject of this inquiry \nwas a writer named James Baldwin. At the time, the FBI investigated many \nartists and thinkers, but most of their files were a \nfraction the size of Baldwin’s. During the years when the FBI hounded him, he became one of the best-selling\nblack authors in the world. So what made James Baldwin loom \nso large in the imaginations of both the public and the authorities? Born in Harlem in 1924, he was the oldest of nine children. At age fourteen,\nhe began to work as a preacher. By delivering sermons,\nhe developed his voice as a writer, but also grew conflicted about the Church’s stance on racial inequality and homosexuality. After high school, he began writing novels and essays\nwhile taking a series of odd jobs. But the issues that had driven him \naway from the Church were still inescapable in his daily life. Constantly confronted with racism \nand homophobia, he was angry and disillusioned, \nand yearned for a less restricted life. So in 1948, \nat the age of 24, he moved to Paris on a writing fellowship. From France, he published his first novel, \"Go Tell it on the Mountain,\" in 1953. Set in Harlem, the book explores the Church \nas a source of both repression and hope. It was popular with both black \nand white readers. As he earned acclaim for his fiction, Baldwin gathered his thoughts on race, \nclass, culture and exile in his 1955 extended essay, \n\"Notes of a Native Son.\" Meanwhile, the Civil Rights movement \nwas gaining momentum in America. Black Americans were making incremental \ngains at registering to vote and voting, but were still denied basic dignities in \nschools, on buses, in the work force, and in the armed services. Though he lived primarily in France \nfor the rest of his life, Baldwin was deeply invested in \nthe movement, and keenly aware of his \ncountry’s unfulfilled promise. He had seen family, friends, \nand neighbors spiral into addiction, incarceration\nand suicide. He believed their fates originated \nfrom the constraints of a segregated society. In 1963, he published \"The Fire Next Time,\" an arresting portrait of racial strife in which he held white America \naccountable, but he also went further, arguing that racism hurt white people too. In his view, everyone was inextricably enmeshed \nin the same social fabric. He had long believed that: “People are trapped in history \nand history is trapped in them.” Baldwin’s role in the Civil Rights \nmovement went beyond observing and reporting. He also traveled through the \nAmerican South attending rallies giving lectures \nof his own. He debated both white politicians \nand black activists, including Malcolm X, and served as a liaison between black \nactivists and intellectuals and white establishment leaders \nlike Robert Kennedy. Because of Baldwin’s unique ability to articulate the causes \nof social turbulence in a way that white audiences \nwere willing to hear, Kennedy and others tended to see \nhim as an ambassador for black Americans — a label Baldwin rejected. And at the same time, his faculty with words led the \nFBI to view him as a threat. Even within the Civil Rights movement, Baldwin could sometimes feel \nlike an outsider for his choice to live abroad,\nas well as his sexuality, which he explored openly \nin his writing at a time when homophobia ran rampant. Throughout his life, Baldwin considered it his role\nto bear witness. Unlike many of his peers, he lived to see some of the\nvictories of the Civil Rights movement, but the continuing racial inequalities in \nthe United States weighed heavily on him. Though he may have felt trapped \nin his moment in history, his words have made generations \nof people feel known, while guiding them toward a more \nnuanced understanding of society’s most complex issues."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In 1924, James Baldwin was born in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Birmingham, AL"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chicago, IL"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Harlem, NY"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Brooklyn, NY"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Washington, D.C."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "At the age of fourteen, Baldwin began working as a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shoe Shine Boy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Preacher"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Columnist"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Grocery Store Clerk"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Typist"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In 1948 at the age of 24, Baldwin received a writing fellowship and moved to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Accra, Ghana"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Paris, France"}, {"label": "D", "text": "London, England"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In 1953, Baldwin published his first novel:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Go Tell It on the Mountain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Notes of a Native Son"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Giovanni’s Room"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Another Country"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Baldwin was involved in the Civil Rights Movement and one of the famous activists he debated was:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bayard Rustin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rosa Parks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Medgar Evers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Malcolm X"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}
{"page": 1, "lesson": 13, "title": "The science of falling in love - Shannon Odell", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-science-of-falling-in-love-shannon-odell", "transcript": {"en": "Love is often described as heartwarming,\nheart-wrenching and even heartbreaking. So, what does the brain have\nto do with it? Everything! The journey from first spark to last tear\nis guided by a symphony of neurochemicals and brain systems. As you begin to fall for someone, you may find yourself excessively\ndaydreaming about them and wanting to spend more and more\ntime together. This first stage of love is what\npsychologists call infatuation, or passionate love. Your new relationship\ncan feel almost intoxicating, and when it comes to the brain,\nthat’s not far from the truth. Infatuated individuals show increased\nactivation in the ventral tegmental area. The VTA is the reward-processing \nand motivation hub of the brain, firing when you do things like \neat a sweet treat, quench your thirst, or in more extreme cases,\ntake drugs of abuse. Activation releases the “feel good”\nneurotransmitter dopamine, teaching your brain to repeat behaviors \nin anticipation of receiving the same initial reward. This increased VTA activity is the\nreason love's not only euphoric, but also draws you towards\nyour new partner. At this first stage, it may be hard to see\nany faults in your new perfect partner. This haze is thanks\nto love’s influence on higher cortical brain regions. Some newly infatuated individuals\nshow decreased activity in the brain’s cognitive center, \nthe prefrontal cortex. As activation of this region allows us \nto engage in critical thought and pass judgment, it’s not surprising we tend to see \nnew relationships through rose-colored glasses. While this first stage of love can be an intense rollercoaster of emotions\nand brain activity, it typically only lasts a few months, making way for the more long-lasting\nstage of love, known as attachment,\nor compassionate love. As your relationship develops, you may feel more relaxed \nand committed to your partner thanks in large part to two hormones:\noxytocin and vasopressin. Known as pair-bonding hormones, they signal trust, \nfeelings of social support and attachment. In this way, romantic love \nis not unlike other forms of love, as these hormones also help bond\nfamilies and friendships. Further, oxytocin can inhibit \nthe release of stress hormones, which is why spending time \nwith a loved one can feel so relaxing. As early love's suspension\nof judgment fades, it can be replaced by a more honest\nunderstanding and deeper connection. Alternatively, as your rose-colored\nglasses begin to lose their tint, problems in your relationship\nmay become more evident. No matter the reason \na relationship ends, we can blame the pain that accompanies\nheartbreak on the brain. The distress of a breakup activates\nthe insular cortex, a region that processes pain— both physical, \nlike spraining your ankle, as well as social, \nlike the feelings of rejection. As days pass, you may find yourself\nonce again daydreaming about or craving contact with your lost partner. The drive to reach out may\nfeel overwhelming, like an extreme hunger or thirst. When looking at photos\nof a former partner, heartbroken individuals again show\nincreased activity in the VTA, the motivation and reward center \nthat drove feelings of longing during the initial stages \nof the relationship. This emotional whirlwind also likely\nactivates your body’s alarm system, the stress axis, leaving you feeling \nshaken and restless. As time goes on, higher cortical regions which oversee \nreasoning and impulse control, can pump the brakes on this distress\nand craving signaling.

Butler? - Ayana Jamieson and Moya Bailey", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-sci-fi-superstar-octavia-e-butler-ayana-jamieson-and-moya-bailey", "transcript": {"en": "Following a devastating nuclear war, Lilith Iyapo awakens\nafter 250 years of stasis to find herself surrounded by a group \nof aliens called the Oankali. These highly evolved beings\nwant to trade DNA by breeding with humans so that each species’ genes \ncan diversify and fortify the other. The only alternative they offer is \nsterilization of the entire human race. Should humanity take the leap into \nthe biological unknown, or hold on to its identity and perish? Questions like this haunt \nOctavia Butler’s \"Dawn,\" the first in her trilogy \"Lilith’s Brood.\" A visionary storyteller who \nupended science fiction, Butler built stunning worlds \nthroughout her work– and explored dilemmas that keep \nus awake at night. Born in 1947, Butler grew up shy and introverted in \nPasadena, California. She dreamt up stories from an early age, and was soon scribbling these \nscenarios on paper. At twelve, she begged her mother \nfor a typewriter after enduring a campy science fiction\nfilm called \"Devil Girl From Mars.\" Unimpressed with what she saw, Butler knew she could tell a better story. Much science fiction features \nwhite male heroes who blast aliens or become \nsaviors of brown people. Butler wanted to write diverse characters\nfor diverse audiences. She brought nuance and depth to the \nrepresentation of their experiences. For Butler, imagination was not only for planting \nthe seeds of science fiction– but also a strategy for surviving an \nunjust world on one’s own terms. Her work often takes troubling \nfeatures of the world such as discrimination on the basis of \nrace, gender, class, or ability, and invites the reader to contemplate \nthem in new contexts. One of her most beloved novels, the \"Parable of the Sower,\" follows this pattern. It tells the story of Lauren Oya Olamina as she makes her way through a near-future\nCalifornia, ruined by corporate greed, inequality, and environmental destruction. As she struggles with hyperempathy, or a condition in the novel that \ncauses her to feel others’ pain, and less often, their pleasure. Lauren embarks on a quest with a group \nof refugees to find a place to thrive. There, they seek to live in accordance \nwith Lauren’s found religion, Earthseed, which is based on the principle that humans must adapt to an \never-changing world. Lauren’s quest had roots \nin a real life event– California Prop 187, which attempted to deny undocumented\nimmigrants fundamental human rights, before it was deemed unconstitutional. Butler frequently incorporated \ncontemporary news into her writing. In her 1998 sequel to \"The Parable of the \nSower,\" \"Parable of the Talents,\" she wrote of a presidential candidate who controls Americans with virtual \nreality and “shock collars.” His slogan? “Make America great again.” While people have noted her prescience, Butler was also interested in \nre-examining history. For instance,\n\"Kindred\" tells the story of a woman who is repeatedly\npulled back in time to the Maryland plantation \nof her ancestors. Early on, she learns that her mission \nis to save the life of the white man who will rape her great grandmother. If she doesn’t save him, \nshe herself will cease to exist. This grim dilemma forces Dana to \nconfront the ongoing trauma of slavery and sexual violence \nagainst Black women. With her stories of women \nfounding new societies, time travelers overcoming \nhistorical strife, and interspecies bonding, Butler had a profound influence on \nthe growing popularity of Afrofuturism. That’s a cultural movement where Black writers and artists who are \ninspired by the past, present and future, produce works that incorporate magic, \nhistory, technology and much more. As Lauren comes to learn in \n\"Parable of the Sower,\" \"All that you touch you Change. All that you Change Changes you. The only lasting truth is Change.”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the name of the nationally recognized prize Butler was awarded for her fiction and nonfiction writing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tony Award"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Academy Award"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pulitzer Prize"}, {"label": "D", "text": "MacArthur “Genius” Grant"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What terrible sci-fi movie inspired a young Octavia Butler to ask her mom for a typewriter?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mars Needs Women"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Angry Red Planet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Devil Girl From Mars"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Incredible Shrinking Woman"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Octavia E.

{"page": 1, "lesson": 15, "title": "Mom vs. dad: What did you inherit?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/zePHDfBi", "transcript": {"en": "It’s easy to feel like you’re an even\nmix of your parents, but that’s not always the case. So, who should you be blaming over those traits\nyou don’t like? What did you inherit from Mom and what came\nfrom Dad? Colour-blind? If you’re a male, you can thank your mother. Red-green colour blindness is an X-linked\ndisorder that affects nearly 6% of the male population worldwide, but only 0.4% of females. This is because males only inherit one X chromosome,\nwhich is from their mother, and that’s where red-green colorblindness comes from. If you’re a female, you have to get a the\nX-variant from both parents. So that 0.4% can blame dad as well! Balding? A big component comes from the X-chromosome\nhere too, so you likely inherited this from your mom. However, a study involving 52,000 people found\nthat genes on other chromosomes can affect this condition, on top of environmental factors\nsuch as age, stress, and diet - so mom isn’t entirely to blame! Research has also found that the shape of\nthe end of your nose, the area above and below the lips, cheekbones and the inner corner\nof the eye are highly influenced by genetics. And interestingly, the more they resemble\nyour father as a child, the healthier you’re likely to be. Why? Scientists believe that a father-child resemblance\ncauses fathers to spend more time engaging in positive parenting, which ultimately contributes\nto healthier kids. Now, even though you get half of your 46 chromosomes\nfrom mom and the other from dad, a study involving genetically diverse mice found that for 60%\nof genes the paternal copy was more active than the maternal copy. This phenomenon is known as allelic imbalance. The same study also noted that the brains\nof these particular mice more closely resembled that of their dad than their mom. However, in humans we actually see the opposite. Our brains are more similar to our mother,\nwhich is particularly true for daughters. Interestingly, the similar brain regions are\nactually associated with depressive conditions, suggesting that mood disorders may pass from\nmother to daughter. Biologists used to believe that all DNA came\nfrom the nucleus, but we now know that the mitochondria (AKA the powerhouse of the cell)\nalso kicks in some protein coding genes. And this mitochondrial DNA is specifically\ninherited from your mom because your dad’s degraded immediately after fertilization. Considering how important mitochondrial DNA\nis in the cell, there is a stronger maternal link. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA have been associated\nwith Type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease - which more likely came from your mom. Maternal inheritance gave rise to the idea\nof a “Mitochondrial Eve”, a woman who lived between 180,000 to 580,000 years ago\nfrom which all human mitochondrial DNA is rooted. At the end of the day, it may seem like a\nlot of traits actually come from your mom, or at least, from the X chromosome - and that’s\ngenerally true, genetically. The Y-chromosome is very small, and doesn’t\ncontain as many genes; and both females and males contain X-chromosomes, which carry more\ngenes. But as we continue to research more about\nourselves at the genetic level, the division between what you got from mom vs. dad may\nbecome even more pronounced.

I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time and my mother packed me his suitcase full of books which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do because in my family reading was the primary group activity and this might sound antisocial to you but for us it was really just a different way of being social you had the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you but you were also free to go roaming around the Adventureland inside your own mind and I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this but better I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books and their matching nightgowns camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol and on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit and it went like this our owd ie that's the way we spell rowdy rowdy rowdy let's get rowdy yeah so I couldn't figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy or why we had to spell this word incorrectly but I recited the cheer I recited the cheer along with everybody else I did my best and I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books but the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me why are you being so mellow mellow of course being the exact opposite of our owd ie and then the second time I tried it the counselor came up to me he was a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all really work very hard to be outgoing and so I put my books away back in their suitcase and I put them under my bed and there they stayed for the rest of the summer and I felt kind of guilty about this I felt as if the books needed me somehow and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them but I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer now I tell you this story about summer camp I could have told you fifty others just like it all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go and that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert and I always sense deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were but for years I denied this intuition and so I became a Wall Street lawyer of all things instead of the writer that I had always longed to be partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too and I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends and I made these self negating choices so reflexively but I wasn't even aware that I was making them now this is what many introverts to you and it's our loss for sure but it is also our colleagues loss and our community's loss and at the risk of sounding grandiose it is the world's loss because when it comes to creativity and to leadership we need introverts doing what they do best a third to a half of the population are introverts a third to a half so that's one out of every two or three people you know so even if you are an extrovert you self you know I'm talking about your co-workers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting right next to you right now all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society we all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we're doing now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is and it's different from being shy shyness is about fear of social judgment introversion is more about how do you respond to stimulation including social stimulation so extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched on and they're most capable when they're in quieter more low-key environments not all the time you know these things are an absolute but a lot of the time so the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us but now here's where the bias comes in our most important institutions our schools and our workplaces they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts need for lots of stimulation and also we are living through this belief system we have a belief system right now that I call the new groupthink which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place so if you picture the typical classroom nowadays when I was going to school we sat in rows you know we thought in rows of desks like this and we did most of our work pretty autonomously but nowadays your typical classroom has pods of desks - four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other and kids are working in countless group assignments even in subjects like math and creative writing which you would think would depend on solo flights of thought kids are now expected to act as committee members and for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone those kids are seen as outliers often or worse as problem cases and the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable according to according to research okay same thing is true in our workplaces we now most of us work in open-plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our co-workers and when it comes to leadership introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful much less likely to take outsides risks which is something we might all favor nowadays and an interesting research by Adam grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts to you because when they are managing proactive employees they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas whereas an extrovert can quite unwittingly get so excited about about things that they're putting their own stamp on things and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface now in fact some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts I'll give you some examples Eleanor Roosevelt Rosa Parks Gandhi all these people described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy and they all took the spotlight even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to and this turns out to have a special power all its own because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at they were there because they had no choice because they were driven to do what they thought was right now I think at this point it's important for me to say that I actually love extroverts I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts including my beloved husband and we all fall at different points of course along the introvert extrovert spectrum you know even Carl Jung the psychologist who first popularized these terms said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert he said that such a man would be an Aluna tick asylum if he existed at all and some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert extrovert spectrum and we call these people ambiverts and I often think that they have the best of all worlds but many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other and what I'm saying is that culturally we need a much better balance we mean we need more of a yin and yang between these two types now this is especially important when it comes to creativity into productivity because when psychologists look at the lives have the most creative people what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them and this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity so Darwin knew he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations see you dork I sell better known as dr. Seuss he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely belltower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla California and he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him to be this kind of jolly Santa Claus like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubicle and hewlett-packard where he was working at the time and he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up now of course this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating and Kayson point is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe and in fact we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude it's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it if you look at most of the world's major religions you will find seekers Moses Jesus Buddha Muhammad seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community so no wilderness no revelations this is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology you know it turns out that we can't even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring and mimicking their opinions even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you're attracted to you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that's what you're doing and groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room even though there's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas I mean zero so you might be following the person with the best ideas but you might not and do you really want to leave it up to chance much better for everybody to go off by themselves generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics and then come together as a team to talk some through in a will manage environment and take it from there now if all this is true then why are we getting it so wrong why are we setting up our schools this way in our workplaces and why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time one answer lies deep in our cultural history Western societies and in particular the US have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and man of contemplation but in the you know in America's early days we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude and if you look at the self-help books from this era as they all had titles with things like character the grandest thing in the world and they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority but then we hit the twentieth century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality you know what happened is we had evolved from an agricultural economy to a world of big business and so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities and instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives now they are having to prove themselves at a crowd of strangers so quite understandably quality is like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important I'm sure enough the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like how to win friends and influence people and they feature as their role models really great sales so that's the world we're living in today that's our cultural inheritance now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all you know the same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountaintops also teach us love and trust and the problems that we are facing today and fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together but I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems so now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today guess what books have a suitcase full of books here's Margaret Atwood cat's-eye here's a novel by Milan Kundera and here's the guide of the perplexed by Maimonides but these are not exactly my books I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors my grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up partly because it was filled with his very gentle very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books I mean literally every table every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books just like the rest of my family my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the world was to read but he also loved his congregation and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi he would take the fruits of each week's reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought and people would come from all over to hear him speak but here's the thing about my grandfather underneath his ceremonial role he was really modest and really introverted so much so that when he delivered these sermons he had trouble making eye contact with a very same congregation that he had been speaking to you for 62 years and even away from the podium when you called him to say hello he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time but when he died at the age of 94 the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him and so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example in my own way so I just published a book about introversion and it took me about seven years to write and for me that seven years was like total bliss because you know I was reading I was writing I was thinking I was researching it was my version of my grandfather's hours a day alone in his library but now all of a sudden my job is very different and my job is to be out here talking about it talking about introversion and that's a lot harder for me because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now this is not my natural milieu so I prepared for moments like these as best I could I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get and I called this my year of speaking dangerously and that actually helped a lot but I'll tell you what helps even more is my sense my belief my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude we truly are poised on the brink of dramatic change I mean we are and so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision number one stop the madness for constant group work just stop it thank you and I want to be clear about what I'm saying because I believe our offices should be encouraging casual chatty cafe style types of interactions you know the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas that is great that's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts but we need much more privacy and much more freedom much more autonomy at work school same thing we need to be teaching kids to work together for sure but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own this is especially important for extroverted children too they need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part okay number two go to the wilderness be like Buddha have your own revelations I'm not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often number three take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase and why you put it there so extroverts maybe your suitcases are also full of books or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment whatever it is I hope you take these things out every chance you get at grace us with your energy and your joy but introverts you being you you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what's inside your own suitcase and that's okay but occasionally just occasionally I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry so I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly thank you very much thank you you"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "During her

Would she have gone to school\nand set the stage alight? In her essay \"A Room of One's Own,\" Virginia Woolf argues that this would\nhave been impossible. She concocts a fictional sister\nwho's stuck at home, snatching time to scribble a few pages before she finds herself\nbetrothed and runs away. While her brother finds fame and fortune,\nshe remains abandoned and anonymous. In this thought experiment, Woolf demonstrates the tragedy\nof genius restricted, and looks back through time for hints\nof these hidden histories. She wrote, \"When one reads \nof a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even a very remarkable man\nwho had a mother, then I think we're on the track\nof a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen.\" \"A Room of One's Own\" considers a world\ndenied great works of art due to exclusion and inequality. How best can we understand\nthe internal experience of alienation? In both her essays and fiction, Virginia Woolf shapes the slippery nature \nof subjective experience into words. Her characters frequently lead inner lives\nthat are deeply at odds with their external existence. To help make sense of these disparities,\nthe next time you read Woolf, here are some aspects of her life\nand work to consider. She was born Adeline Virginia Stephen\nin 1882 to a large and wealthy family, which enabled her to pursue a life\nin the arts. The death of her mother in 1895\nwas followed by that of her half-sister, father, and brother \nwithin the next ten years. These losses led to Woolf's first\ndepressive episode and subsequent institutionalization. As a young woman, she purchased a house in the Bloomsbury area \nof London with her siblings. This brought her into contact\nwith a circle of creatives, including E.M. Forster, Clive Bell, Roger Fry, and Leonard Woolf. These friends became known\nas the Bloomsbury Group, and Virginia and Leonard married in 1912. The members of this group were prominent\nfigures in Modernism, a cultural movement that sought\nto push the boundaries of how reality is represented. Key features of Modernist writing include\nthe use of stream of consciousness, interior monologue, distortions in time, and multiple or shifting perspectives. These appear in the work of Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, and Woolf herself. While reading Joyce's \"Ulysses,\"\nWoolf began writing \"Mrs. Dalloway.\" Like \"Ulysses,\" the text takes place\nover the course of a single day and opens under seemingly\nmundane circumstances. \"Mrs. Dalloway said she would\nbuy the flowers herself.\" But the novel dives deeply\ninto the characters' traumatic pasts, weaving the inner world of numbed\nsocialite Clarissa Dalloway, with that of the shell-shocked veteran\nSeptimus Warren Smith. Woolf uses interior monologue\nto contrast the rich world of the mind against her characters' \nexternal existences. In her novel \"To the Lighthouse,\" mundane moments, like a dinner party,\nor losing a necklace trigger psychological revelations\nin the lives of the Ramsay's, a fictionalized version \nof Woolf's family growing up. \"To the Lighthouse\" also contains\none of the most famous examples of Woolf's radical representation of time. In the Time Passes section, ten years are distilled \ninto about 20 pages. Here, the lack of human presence\nin the Ramsays' beach house allows Woolf to reimagine time\nin flashes and fragments of prose. \"The house was left. \nThe house was deserted. It was left like a shell on a sand hill\nto fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it.\" In her novel \"The Waves,\" there is little distinction between\nthe narratives of the six main characters. Woolf experiments \nwith collective consciousness, at times collapsing the six voices\ninto one. \"It is not one life that I look back upon: I am not one person: \nI am many people: I do not altogether know who I am, Jinny, Susan, Neville, Rhoda or Louis, or how to distinguish \nmy life from their's.\" In \"The Waves,\" six become one,\nbut in the gender-bending \"Orlando,\" a single character \ninhabits multiple identities. The protagonist is a poet who switches\nbetween genders and lives for 300 years. With its fluid language \nand approach to identity, \"Orlando\" is considered \na key text in gender studies. The mind can only fly \nso far from the body before it returns \nto the constraints of life. Like many of her characters,\nWoolf's life ended in tragedy when she drowned herself at the age of 59. Yet, she expressed hope beyond suffering. Through deep thought,\nWoolf's characters are shown to temporarily transcend \ntheir material reality, and in its careful consideration\nof the complexity of the mind, her work charts the importance of making\nour inner lives known to each other."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "\"A Room of One’s Own\" argues that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shakespeare had a secret sister called Judith"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Women need to be totally separate from men to make better art"}, {"label": "C", "text": "We need a more equal society to support female creativity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Art created by women had reached its peak during Woolf’s time"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is not a feature of Modernist literature:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stream of consciousness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Experimental language"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chronological plots"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Interior monologue"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "\"Mrs. Dalloway\" can be classified as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An adventure story"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A psychological thriller"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A romance"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A tragedy of daily life"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "\"To The Lighthouse\" experiments with time in order to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Imagine the passage of time when humans are absent"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Draw our attention to the significance of mundane moments"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Collapse the distance between a character’s inner and outer worlds"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Woolf’s use of collective consciousness in \"The Waves\":", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Suggests that all minds operate in the same way"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Makes one character speak for all the characters"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Makes it unclear which single character is speaking in the novel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Distinguishes the characters from each other"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

I thought they were both pork chops. And because my grandmother thought it was cute   and because they were my favourite she let me keep doing it. Not really a big deal. One day, before I realized fat kids are not \ndesigned to climb trees I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body I didn't want to tell my grandmother about it because I was scared I'd get in trouble for playing somewhere that I shouldn't have been. A few days later the gym teacher noticed the bruise and I got sent to the principal's office. From there I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home. I saw no reason to lie. As far as I was concerned life was pretty good I told her, \"Whenever I'm sad my grandmother gives me karate chops.\" This led to a full scale investigation and I was removed from the house for three days... until they finally decided to ask \nhow I got the bruises. News of this silly little story quickly spread\nthrough the school and I earned my first nickname: Pork Chop. To this day... I hate pork chops. I'm not the only kid who grew up this way. Surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme... about sticks and stones As if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called, and we got called them all. So we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us. That we'd be lonely forever. That we'd never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their tool shed. So broken heart strings bled the blues as we tried to empty ourselves so we would feel nothing. Don't tell me that hurts less than a broken bone. That an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away That there's no way for it to metastasize It does. She was eight years old... Our first day of grade three when she got called \"ugly.\" We both got moved to the back of the class so we would stop getting bombarded by spit balls But the school halls were a battleground where we found ourselves outnumbered\nday after wretched day. We used to stay inside for recess because outside was worse. Outside we'd have to rehearse running away   or learn to stay still like statues giving\nno clues that we were there. In grade five they taped a sign to her desk that read \"Beware of Dog.\" To this day, despite a loving husband, She doesn't think she's beautiful because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half of her face. Kids used to say she looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase but couldn't quite get the job done. And they'll never understand that she's raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word \"Mom.\" Because they see her heart before they see her skin. That she's only ever always been amazing. He was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree. Adopted but not because his parents opted\nfor a different destiny. He was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy. Started therapy in 8th grade. Had a personality made up of tests and pills. Lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs. Four fifths suicidal, a tidal wave of anti-depressants, and an adolescence of being called \"Popper.\" One part because of the pills and ninety nine parts because of the cruelty. He tried to kill himself in grade ten when a kid who could still go home to mom and dad had the audacity to tell him \"get over it.\"  As if depression is something \nthat can be remedied by any of the contents found in a first aid kit. To this day, he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends, could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends in the moments before it's about to fall and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration, he remains a conversation piece between people who can't understand sometimes becoming drug free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity. We weren't the only kids who grew up this way. To this day kids are still being called names. The classics were \"Hey stupid\" \"Hey spaz\" Seems like each school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year and if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear do they make a sound? Are they just the background noise of a soundtrack stuck on repeat when people say things like \"kids can be cruel\"? Every school was a big top circus tent and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers, from clowns to carnies. All of these were miles ahead of who we were. We were freaks. Lobster claw boys and bearded ladies Oddities Juggling depression and loneliness, \nplaying Solitaire, spin the bottle, Trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal. But at night, while the others slept We kept walking the tightrope. It was practice and yeah, some of us fell. But I want to tell them that all of this is just debris, leftover when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be.   And if you can't see anything beautiful about yourself, get a better mirror. Look a little closer. Stare a little longer. Because there's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit. You built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself. You signed it, \"they were wrong.\" Because maybe you didn't belong to a group or clique. Maybe they decided to pick you last\nfor basketball or everything. Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show and tell but never told because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it? You have to believe that they were wrong They have to be wrong.\nWhy else would we still be here? We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them. We stem from a root planted in the belief That we are not what we were called We are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting\nempty on a highway. And if in some way we are, don't worry. We only got out to walk and get gas. We are graduating members from the class of \"we made it.\" Not the faded echoes of voices crying out \"names will never hurt me.\" Of course, they did.\nBut our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act that has less to do with pain... and more to do with beauty."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How did the narrator garner his first nickname?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He thought pork chops and karate chops were the same thing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He ate lots of candy and he gained too much weight"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He had a birthmark on his arm that looked like a porkchop"}, {"label": "D", "text": "When he laughed, he snorted like a pig"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What did the narrator and his friend do during recess?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They stayed inside"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They had to clean the chalkboards"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They pretended to be aliens and astronauts"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They met with their school counsellor"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

She had always been a dutiful daughter—\nstaying home and creating works of embroidery\nthat brought her parents pride. And yet, although only boys were allowed\nat the Confucius Academy in Hangzhou, what Yingtai truly wanted\nwas to go to school. She begged her parents \nto let her attend dressed as a boy and, seeing her determination \nand clever disguises, they finally agreed. However, they only gave her permission\nwhen she promised to keep her true identity a secret and eventually return to the traditional\npath they’d set for her. Elated, Yingtai began her journey\nto Hangzhou. On the way, she found herself \nat a crossroads, unsure which route to take\nwhen a young man approached. As their eyes met, \nthey shared an instant connection. Yingtai learned that his name was \nLiang Shanbo, and that he’d be her classmate\nat the academy, so they walked the rest \nof the way together, rapt in conversation. Yingtai realized that, \ndespite her meticulous disguise, she felt that she could\nfinally be herself. The two decided to celebrate \nwhat they thought would be a long, close friendship, \nand became sworn brothers. At the academy, \nYingtai buried herself in books and studied with Shanbo \nlate into the nights. The two felt at home so long as they were\nat each other’s sides. They shared a room, but even though\nShanbo questioned her about it, Yingtai always used the bathroom alone and buttoned her thick robes \nup to her chin— no matter the weather. Now and again, Yingtai heard students\nmuttering about her secretive behavior. As months slipped into years,\nYingtai continued to excel at her studies and felt like her past—\nand intended future—were lifetimes away. Yet the whispers grew louder. And after three years,\nshe had no choice but to leave. Parting tearfully, Yingtai asked Shanbo\nto visit her. When Yingtai returned home, her parents announced that the Ma family\nfrom the neighboring village had sent a matchmaker \nto ask their permission for Yingtai to marry their son. They’d found it a fitting match\nand accepted. Trying to hide her disappointment, \nYingtai honored their agreement. But as she prepared for another new life,\nshe thought of Shanbo. Meanwhile, he too was distracted—\nhis studies dull without Yingtai near. When Shanbo finally visited \nYingtai’s house, he came upon a young woman. He was about to ask for her brother, but as their eyes met, he recognized \nthe young scholar he’d always loved. Shanbo knew he couldn’t stand\nbeing separated from Yingtai again and asked her to marry him. But, heartbroken, Yingtai told him \nthat she was already promised to another. Shanbo was devastated, but he understood\nthat Yingtai had to abide by her parents’ wishes, \nand they parted again. Shanbo fell ill and grew weaker\nby the day. Worried, his family sent a matchmaker\nto the Zhu family. But, because of Yingtai’s \ncurrent engagement, her father refused the proposal. Doing otherwise would bring their family\npublic shame. Shanbo’s Illness took a turn for the worse and, sensing he wouldn’t live\nto see her married, Shanbo wrote Yingtai a final letter. If Yingtai loved him,\nhe asked that she burn incense in front of his tomb \nwhen she was on her way to the Ma family. When Yingtai’s wedding day came,\nit also felt like a funeral. As the procession wound through town\nunder stormy skies, Yingtai broke off and knelt\nin front of Shanbo’s tomb, lighting incense and offering sacrifices\nthrough her tears. Suddenly, a clap of thunder sounded above and a lightning bolt shot \nthrough the tomb, fracturing the stone. Without hesitation, \nYingtai threw herself in. As her parents rushed \nto rescue their daughter, two butterflies fluttered \nout of the crack. This time, Yingtai had transformed \nfor good.

My brother and I spent most of our time in the room in the back\ncalled \"the office.\" \"The office\" was really\njust a storage room, but it had our gaming systems, and the game that we played the most\nwas called Super Smash Brothers Melee. For those who don't know, Super Smash Brothers Melee\nis an older fighting game made for the Nintendo GameCube. My brother and I spent hours\nplaying this game, so much that we even challenged\nrestaurant customers to matches. Eventually, my friends dragged me out\nto a local tournament, where I ended up placing 13th out of 33. Not bad, but definitely far from the best. After training with higher level players, and taking notes\non matches I found online, I started to travel\nto national tournaments, and before I knew it, I was being whisked around\nthe United States at the age of 17, all because of a video game. Totally living the dream life, right? This is how I ran head first into the competitive\nSuper Smash Brothers Melee community, a scene that I've been a part of\nfor nearly ten years. I'm sure that when\nI say competitive gaming, you guys are imagining a room of people\nhunched over their laptops. Sometimes it can look like that, but more often\nit looks something like this. (Laughter) Because Smash Brothers Melee\nis such an old game, it requires those big,\nboxy TVs to be played on. Our players are so dedicated, that they will actually lug these things\nonto their flights as carry-ons. (Laughter) The community is also absurdly diverse. This is a photo of Apex,\nan annual tournament held in New Jersey. In 2013, over 1500 people showed up\nfrom 16 different countries. I feel like if 16 countries\nare flying out to New Jersey, that's saying something. Sorry, New Jersey. (Laughter) In the gaming community, I was known by my gamer tag \"_milktea,\" but in real life,\nI was still very much just Lilian. When I was 17, I was shy and quiet, and I was often bullied by my classmates\nfor being different, for being Asian. Some of them made fun\nof the clothes I wore. Others asked me out on dates as a joke. Another called me a Chinese prostitute. But when I was \"_milktea,\" I was part of a community\nthat welcomed and accepted me. Except what's missing from this picture? Do you see any women? When the gender imbalance is this large,\nsocial dynamics can become a bit skewed. You get a lot more attention\nthan you normally would. [milktea is an angel] At the time, I didn't understand why\nI was getting this attention. I just knew that it was so much better\nthan what I was dealing with at school. [I love Milktea.] Here's one of my favorites. [Milktea chan you are really attractive.] [If I had to rate you for beauty\nI give you a 8 out of 10] [Only because I've been\ncrushing on another girl for a long time] (Laughter) But then, things took\na turn for the worse. [Why is everyone blaming milktea lol?] [She is a harlot.] [She doesn't like Smash,\nshe just wants attention.] And then you started\nto see comments like this. [coz you're only known in the scene\nfor being the subject of nerdy fantasies] [suck a **** in crappy smasher's dreams] Over years,\nI began internalizing all of this, and then I took these attitudes\nand projected them onto other women. \"Ew, why is she so girly?\nIs she even a real gamer?\" I felt my voice shrinking\nand the resent growing inside of me, and eventually, I distanced myself\nfrom the Smash community altogether. Fast forward a few years. I landed my first job in New York City. There, I realized that sexist behavior\ndidn't have to be the norm. But nevertheless, I stayed quiet\nand withdrawn. Public speaking? Never going to happen. (Laughter) But then, this Facebook comment\nappeared in my feed. [Stop chalking up the terror\nof the internet to the Smash community.] [In general, we're very\naccepting of females] I swear, at that very moment, my inner wallflower\nspontaneously combusted. I started writing blog posts\nthat talked about my experiences and issues I had faced\nwithin the community, and to my surprise,\nthey went viral within our scene. A well-known fighting game website\npicked up one of my posts and later on, Polygon, a gaming site,\ncovered my future work. All of this led to the creation\nof The New Meta, a panel that I cofounded and moderated\nwith the NYU Game Center. We roped in tons of women\nfrom different gaming communities to talk about issues of sexism\nwithin gaming. But the entire panel's point\nwas to raise awareness in a way that did not shame male gamers. As a woman, I was sexist, and even misogynistic,\nagainst my own gender. Sometimes, when you've been immersed\nin an environment for long enough, it can be hard to differentiate\nbetween harmful behaviors and normal ones. While some gamers\nare intentionally malicious, some may not even realize that they're perpetuating sexist\nbehaviors in the first place. Empathizing with these gamers\nis more productive than outright dismissing them. Initiate a conversation. Deconstruct these behaviors, no matter how obvious\nthey might seem to you. And please, leave\nthe accusatory tone behind. If I had been dismissed\nas a sexist neckbeard, I wouldn't be on this stage\ntalking to you right now. And to my surprise, I found that people were willing\nto change, and they wanted to help. [As a guy, how to treat girls\nin eSports equally?] [Trying my hardest,\nbut advice would help.] And whenever I had any doubts,\nI started to receive feedback like this. [I got a few female Smashers\ninto the scene because of you.] This entire experience has shown me that my silence only further enabled\nsexism within gaming. Nobody is perfect. Internalizing biases and becoming lost\nin them is deceptively easy. By being vocal, you force yourself and those around you to reevaluate their actions\nand their perceptions. Everyone in this room has a voice. You have to use it,\nand you have to use it responsibly. Not only can you provoke change, but you can empower others to do so, too. Thank you.

That day, nearly a quarter million people gathered on the national mall to demand an end to the discrimination,\nsegregation, violence, and economic exclusion \nblack people still faced across the United States. None of it would have been possible \nwithout the march’s chief organizer – a man named Bayard Rustin. Rustin grew up in a Quaker household, and began peacefully protesting\nracial segregation in high school. He remained committed to \npacifism throughout his life, and was jailed in 1944 as a conscientious \nobjector to World War II. During his two-year imprisonment, he protested the segregated \nfacilities from within. Wherever Rustin went, he organized and advocated,  and was constantly attuned to the \nmethods, groups, and people who could help further \nmessages of equality. He joined the Communist Party when black American’s civil rights \nwere one of its priorities, but soon became disillusioned by the \nparty’s authoritarian leanings and left. In 1948, he traveled to India to learn the \npeaceful resistance strategies of the recently assassinated \nMahatma Gandhi. He returned to the United States armed with strategies \nfor peaceful protest, including civil disobedience. He began to work with \nMartin Luther King Jr in 1955, and shared these ideas with him. As King’s prominence increased, Rustin became his main advisor, as well as a key strategist in the \nbroader civil rights movement. He brought his organizing expertise  to the 1956 bus boycotts \nin Montgomery, Alabama —in fact, he had organized and participated \nin a transportation protest that helped inspire the boycotts \nalmost a decade before. His largest-scale organizing project \ncame in 1963, when he led the planning for the \nnational march on Washington. The possibility of riots that could \ninjure marchers and undermine their message of peaceful \nprotest was a huge concern. Rustin not only worked with the DC \npolice and hospitals to prepare, but organized and trained a volunteer \nforce of 2,000 security marshals. In spite of his deft management, some of the other organizers did \nnot want Rustin to march in front with other leaders from the south, \nbecause of his homosexuality. Despite these slights, Rustin maintained his focus,\nand on the day of the march he delivered the\nmarchers' demands in a speech directed at \nPresident John F. Kennedy. The march itself proceeded smoothly,\nwithout any violence. It has been credited with helping pass \nthe 1964 Civil Rights Act, which ended segregation in public places \nand banned employment discrimination, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which outlawed discriminatory \nvoting practices. In spite of his decades of service, Rustin’s positions on certain political \nissues were unpopular among his peers. Some thought he wasn’t critical enough \nof the Vietnam War, or that he was too eager to collaborate\nwith the political establishment including the president and congress. Others were uncomfortable with his \nformer communist affiliation. But ultimately, both his belief\nin collaboration with the government \nand his membership to the communist party had been driven by his desire\nto maximize tangible gains in liberties for black Americans, and to do so as quickly as possible.

And whenever we start a new unit, I like to begin by having all the students\nlist everything they know about it, and then we also list questions we have. And I had the type of moment\nthat every teacher has nightmares about. One of my students\nhad just asked the question, \"Why are some people racist?\" And another student, let's call her Abby, had just raised her hand and volunteered: \"Maybe some people don't like black people\nbecause their skin is the color of poop.\" Yeah, I know. So, as if on cue,\nmy entire class exploded. Half of them immediately started laughing, and the other half started yelling at Abby and shouting things like, \"Oh, my God, you can't say that,\nthat's racist!\" So just take a second\nto freeze this scene in your mind. There's a class\nof nine- and ten-year-olds, and half of them are in hysterics because they think\nAbby has said something wildly funny, and the other half are yelling at her\nfor saying something offensive. And then you have Abby,\nsitting there completely bewildered because, in her mind, she doesn't\nunderstand the weight of what she said and why everybody is reacting this way. And then you have me, the teacher, standing there in the corner,\nlike, about to have a panic attack. So as a classroom teacher, I have to make split-second\ndecisions all the time. And I knew I needed to react, but how? Consider your fight-or-flight instincts. I could fight by raising my voice\nand reprimanding her for her words. Or flight -- just change the subject and quickly start reaching\nfor another subject, like anything to get my students' minds\noff the word \"poop.\" However, as we know, the right thing to do\nis often not the easy thing to do. And as much as I wanted\nthis moment to be over, and that I knew both of these options\nwould help me escape the situation, I knew that this was far too important\nof a teachable moment to miss. So after standing there\nfor what felt like an eternity, I unfroze and I turned\nto face my class, and I said, \"Actually, Abby makes a point.\" And my students kind of\nlooked at each other, all confused. And I continued, \"One reason why racism exists is because people with light skin\nhave looked at people with dark skin and said that their skin was ugly. And even use this reason\nas an excuse to dehumanize them. And the reason why we're learning\nabout race and racism in the first place is to educate ourselves to know better. And to understand\nwhy comments like this are hurtful, and to make sure\nthat people with dark skin are always treated\nwith respect and kindness.\" Now, this was a truly terrifying\nteachable moment. But as we moved forward\nin the conversation, I noticed that both Abby\nand the rest of the kids were still willing to engage. And as I watched the conversation\nreally marinate with my students, I began to wonder how many of my students\nhave assumptions just like Abby. And what happens when those assumptions\ngo unnoticed and unaddressed, as they so often do? But first, I think it's important\nto take a step back and even consider\nwhat makes a topic taboo. I don't remember receiving\nan official list of things you're not supposed to talk about. But I do remember hearing,\nover and over, growing up: there are two things you do not talk about\nat family get-togethers. And those two things\nare religion and politics. And I always thought this was very curious because religion and politics\noften are such huge influencing factors over so many of our\nidentities and beliefs. But what makes a topic taboo is that feeling of discomfort that arises\nwhen these things come up in conversation. But some people are extremely fluent\nin the language of equity, while other people fear being PC-shamed or that their ignorance will show\nas soon as they open their mouths. But I believe that the first step\ntowards holding conversations about things like equity is to begin by building a common language. And that actually starts\nwith destigmatizing topics that are typically deemed taboo. Now, conversations\naround race, for example, have their own specific language and students need\nto be fluent in this language in order to have these conversations. Now, schools are often the only place where students can feel\nfree and comfortable to ask questions and make mistakes. But, unfortunately, not all students\nfeel that sense of security. Now, I knew that day\nin front of my fourth-graders that how I chose to respond\ncould actually have life-long implications not only for Abby, but for the rest\nof the students in my class. If I had brushed her words aside, the rest of the class could actually infer\nthat this type of comment is acceptable. But if I had yelled at Abby and embarrassed her\nin front of all of her friends, that feeling of shame associated with one\nof her first conversations on race could actually prevent her\nfrom ever engaging on that topic again. Now, teaching kids about equity in schools\nis not teaching them what to think. It is about giving them the tools\nand strategies and language and opportunities\nto practice how to think. For example, think about\nhow we teach kids how to read. We don't start by giving them books. We start by breaking down words\ninto letters and sounds and we encourage them to practice\ntheir fluency by reading every single day, with a partner or with their friends. And we give them\nlots of comprehension questions to make sure that they're\nunderstanding what they're reading. And I believe that teaching\nkids about equity should be approached\nin the exact same way. I like to start by giving my students\na survey every year, about different issues\naround equity and inclusion. And this is a sample survey\nfrom one of my kids, and as you can see,\nthere's some humor in here. For under the question, \"What is race?\" she has written, \"When two or more\ncars, people and animals run to see who is fastest and who wins.\" However, if you look\nat her question, \"What is racism?\" it says, \"When somebody says or calls\nsomeone dark-skinned a mean name.\" So, she's young, but she's showing\nthat she's beginning to understand. And when we act like our students aren't capable\nof having these conversations, we actually do them such a disservice. Now, I also know\nthat these types of conversations can seem really, really intimidating\nwith our students, especially with young learners. But I have taught\nfirst through fifth grades, and I can tell you, for example, that I'm not going to walk\ninto a first-grade classroom and start talking about things\nlike mass incarceration. But even a six-year-old first-grader\ncan understand the difference between what is fair --\npeople getting what they need. We identified a lot\nof these things in class together. And the difference\nbetween fair and equal -- when everybody gets the same thing, especially goody bags at birthday parties. Now, first-graders can also\nunderstand the difference between a punishment and a consequence. And all of these things\nare foundational concepts that anyone needs to understand before having a conversation about mass incarceration\nin the United States. Some people might think\nthat kindergarteners or first-graders are too young to have\nconversations around racism, but also tell you that young kids understand that there are\nmany different components that make up our identities and how people are similar and different, and what it means to have power\nwhen other people don't. When we have these conversations\nwith students at a young age, it actually takes away\nsome of that taboo feeling when those topics come up at a later age. I also know that teaching\nabout these things in schools can feel like navigating a minefield. For example, what happens\nif parents or families aren't on board with having\nthese conversations in schools? But to these people, I can say: these are some examples of things\nthat students have said to me and brought to my attention. For example, I had a student come in\nand whisper to me, \"I've heard all these people\nuse the term LGBTQ, but I don't know what it means\nand I'm too embarrassed to admit it.\" I had a student come in over a weekend\nand come up to me and say, \"You know, I just watched\nthis movie about Australia, and it made me wonder\nif they have racism there, too.\" And I always want my students to be\ncomfortable having these conversations because when they're comfortable\ntalking about it and asking questions, they also build comfort in bringing in\ntheir own lives and experiences in how they relate to these big topics. Also, some teachers might be\nkind of nervous if a student brings up a topic\nor asks a question and they don't know the answer to it. But if a student ever brings\nsomething to my attention and I don't know the answer, I will always admit it and own it because I'm not going to pretend\nto be an expert in something that I don't have experience in\nor I'm not an authority on. That same year, I had a student come in and ask a question\nabout the LGBTQ community. And I just didn't know enough\nto give them an appropriate answer. So instead, I encouraged that student to reach out and ask that question\nto a representative of a nonprofit who had come to speak to our class\nabout that very same issue. When we admit to our students\nthat we don't have all the answers, not only does it humanize us to them, it also shows them that adults\nhave a long way to go, too, when it comes to learning\nabout issues of equity. Now, a little while back,\nI wrote a lesson about consent. And, to some people,\nthis was very exciting because I took this topic\nthat seemed very taboo and scary and I broke it down into a way\nthat was accessible for young learners. However, to other people, the idea of consent\nis so strongly tied to sex, and sex is often considered\na taboo subject, that it made them very uncomfortable. But my students are third-graders, so we're not talking about sex in class. Rather, I wanted them to understand that everybody has different\nphysical boundaries that make them feel comfortable. And the social and emotional\nintelligence it takes to read somebody's words\nand tone and body language are skills that often need\nto be explicitly taught, the same way we teach things\nlike reading and math. And this lesson is not reserved\nfor students of one single demographic. Things like questioning\nand making observations and critical thinking are things that any student\nof any race or ethnicity or background or language or income\nor zip code should be learning in schools. Also, deliberate avoidance\nof these conversations speaks volumes to our students because kids notice when their teachers,\nwhen their textbooks leave out the voices and experiences\nof people like women or people of color. Silence speaks volumes. I recently asked my class of third-graders what they would say to adults\nwho think they're too young to learn about issues of equity. And while this is a small sample\nof my 25 students, all of them agreed that not only are they capable\nof having these conversations, but they view it, the right to learn it,\nas a right and not as a privilege. And, in their words: \"We're big enough\nto know about these things because these problems\nare happening where we live. And we have the right to talk about them because it will be our life\nin the future.\" Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
