For decades, hospitals and research labs\naround the world had a trusted supply of these\nhandy amphibians, employing their help\nin testing for pregnancy and in numerous other\nscientific endeavors. So, what makes these phenomenal frogs\nso special? The remarkable features\nof the African clawed frog have fascinated researchers\nsince the 19th century. We often think of frogs as hopping\naround to snatch up bugs with their lengthy tongues. But this water-dwelling species\nis almost exclusively aquatic, having adapted primarily for swimming\nrather than crawling or jumping. Weirder still, African clawed frogs\nhave no tongues at all. Instead, they suck food directly\ninto their mouths or use their hands to catch larger animals which they tear apart\nwith powerful hind claws. To help get close to their prey, their smooth skin can quickly change color\nto blend into their surroundings. This camouflage ability was particularly\ninteresting to a trio of biologists in South Africa during the 1920s. Hillel Shapiro, Harry Zwarenstein,\nand their teacher, Lancelot Hogben, were researching what role\nthe pituitary gland, a small region of the frog’s brain, might play in the\ncolor changing mechanism. Removing the gland altogether impaired\nthe frogs’ ability to camouflage. But when Hogben injected them with\na pituitary extract derived from an ox, he found an even more surprising result— the frogs began laying eggs. Normally, African clawed frogs\nonly release eggs when a male frog is\nnearby to fertilize them. But this ox hormone triggered their\novulation without the presence of a male. And this process gave\nthe researchers an idea. They knew there was a chemical similarity\nbetween the ox hormone and a hormone found in the urine\nof pregnant people— a compound we know today as the\nchorionic gonadotropin hormone, or hCG. In pregnancy tests of the day, animals like mice and rabbits were\ninjected with human urine as a way of testing\nfor the presence of hCG. However, this required multiple\ndays of injections, as well as killing and dissecting\nthe animals to see whether the hormone was present. Because of these hurdles, the test was\nreserved for specific use cases, leaving most people waiting for visible\nsigns to determine if they were pregnant. But these frogs changed everything. They responded to hCG in roughly 9 hours\nwith no need for dissection. And since their large ovaries\nconstantly generate eggs, they could participate in numerous tests\nover their 15 to 30 year lifespan. Better still, these frogs were abundant\nin their native habitat, making them easy to find,\ncatch, and export. Before long, tens of thousands\nof African clawed frogs were being shipped to hospitals\nall over the world, making reliable pregnancy tests\nwidely available for the first time. In the 1970s, the frogs would be\nsuperseded by chemical tests that detected hCG directly. But by then their widespread presence\nin laboratories had made African clawed frogs\nthe star of numerous studies. Their rapid development and ability\nto produce eggs in any season made them invaluable models\nfor developmental biology. African clawed frogs have even been\npart of biological studies aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. However,\nfrogs can be slippery subjects. More than a few of these amphibians have\nescaped their laboratory enclosures, and in many places, their ferocious appetite allowed them\nto outcompete native amphibians. To make matters worse, they often carry a deadly\nfungus called chytrid, which can cause an infection\nthat lethally disrupts the delicate functioning\nof amphibian skin. In the 20th century, this fungal infection\nhas devastated amphibian populations around the globe, causing the extinction\nof multiple frog species. Because of all these concerns, the African clawed frog is now classified\nas an invasive species, and illegal in many regions. So in the end, like other pregnancy tests, the use of these frogs\nin scientific research has had both\npositive and negative results."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of these characteristics makes the African Clawed Frog unique?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They have permeable skin."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They have no tongue."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They begin their life as a tadpole."}, {"label": "D", "text": "They eat insects."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which aspects of the African Clawed Frog’s biology was Lancelot Hogben particularly interested in studying?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Their ability to change color."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Being a fully aquatic species."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Having no tongue."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Not being able to hop."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What trait made the African Clawed Frog particularly useful as a pregnancy test?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They produced eggs within 8-9 hours."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Their ovaries produce many eggs."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They have a 15-30 year lifespan."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The African Clawed Frog has become a biomedical model that has been used for:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Running experiments in space."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Quantum computing."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Developmental biology."}, {"label": "D", "text": "A and C."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following are issues that are associated with the use of African Clawed Frogs as biomedical models?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Escaped Frogs."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chytrid fungus outbreaks."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Decline of amphibian populations around the globe."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above."}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Many of these pieces pushed\nthe boundaries of form and style, but one was particularly controversial. Hanging in the room’s corner—\nsymbolically occupying a space traditionally reserved\nfor religious icons— was Kazimir Malevich’s “Black Square.” One attendee scoffed\nat the painting’s simplicity, claiming that even a child\ncould have done it. Another went further, writing that\nthe “Black Square” would “lead us all to our doom.” Such critiques have plagued paintings\nlike Malevich’s ever since, their outward simplicity inspiring\noutrage and confusion. But a closer look reveals that\nnot only is Malevich’s work more complicated than it first appears— it may not even be a painting\nof a black square at all. Despite its name, you’ll find\nthe painting’s central form is neither perfectly black\nnor perfectly square. Its sides aren't parallel\nor equal in length, and the shape isn't quite\ncentered on the canvas. Instead, Malevich placed the form\nslightly off-kilter, giving it the appearance of movement and the white surrounding it\na living, vibrating quality. Technical analysis has revealed that\nMalevich already used the canvas for two other paintings. Today, cracks in the aging paint—\nknown as craquelure— reveal fragments of dusty yellows,\nvibrant reds, and faded emeralds, hinting at all the stages Malevich\nwent through before arriving at the\npainting’s final form. His creative process is also evident\nin the vigorous brushstrokes, which are displayed proudly\nand move in a multitude of directions. Fragments of hair\nand Malevich’s fingerprints are also ingrained in the paint, adding both metaphorical\nand literal texture to the work. In many ways, Malevich’s whole history\nis embedded in the “Black Square.” Born to Polish-speaking\nparents in Ukraine, he lived there until he finally saved\nenough money to afford the trip to Moscow. Upon arrival in 1904, he plunged \ninto all the avant-garde styles swirling around the city. He painted in the style of Impressionism\nand absorbed Post-Impressionism. He passed through a Futurist phase and\nthen became influenced by the Cubists. And by 1913, he was on the verge\nof a breakthrough. Malevich realized that even\nthe most cutting-edge artists were still just painting objects\nfrom everyday life. But he was irresistibly drawn\nto what he called the “desert, where nothing is real\nexcept feeling.” And so, feeling became the substance\nof his work. The result was the “Black Square”\nand a new style he named “Suprematism,” where feeling alone was made supreme. This would be achieved through what\nhe called non-objectivity— a departure from the world of objects\nso extreme it went beyond abstraction. Malevich believed the simplification and\ndistortion that characterized abstract art was ultimately meaningless, since these styles were still focused \non depicting real world objects. To him, only the completely\nnon-representational would truly be new. While this radical approach\nalarmed critics, Malevich was undeterred. He spent the next decade explaining\nhis Suprematist works in essays, and teaching his ideas\nto a new generation of artists. But after Stalin's rise\nto power in the 1920s, avant-garde approaches like Suprematism\nwere deemed unproductive to the Communist state. And eventually, it became dangerous to\nproduce any art outside Socialist Realism— an enforced artistic style celebrating\nSoviet leaders and heroic workers. In 1930, Malevich was arrested\nby Soviet authorities for spreading subversive ideas. Under severe pressure,\nhe returned to figuration, painting peasants standing robotically\nin barren spaces. But even these later paintings retained\nglimmers of his earlier ideas. Gradually, the figures lost\ntheir arms and faces— disintegrating as mechanization\ngripped the countryside. During this time,\nMalevich also painted a self-portrait that seemed to have abandoned\nSuprematism completely. But his open hand formed a quadrilateral, and in the painting's corner\nwas a tiny black square. This was the symbol of a man who suffered\nthrough wars and revolutions, but never stopped pushing\nto create a new art— a refuge of pure feeling that lay\nbeyond the burden of objects and the suffering of a divided world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Kazimir Malevich’s Black Square painting was first exhibited in Russia in _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1900"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1905"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1915"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1925"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Cracks which form as paintings age are known as _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Craquelure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Facture"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rifture"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Clefticals"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Kazimir Malevich was born to Polish-speaking parents in what is today _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Latvia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ukraine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Georgia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Estonia"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The Black Square was part of a new movement in art that Malevich called _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Constructivism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Futurism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cubism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Suprematism"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "______ was the term Malevich used to refer to his style of non-representational abstraction.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Non-objectivity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Non-subjectivity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Anti-objectivity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Anti-realism"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "After Stalin’s rise to power in the 1920s, it became dangerous to produce any art outside the style known as _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Neoclassicism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Post-Impressionism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Socialist Realism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dadaism"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 120, "lesson": 3, "title": "What the fossil fuel industry doesn't want you to know - Al Gore", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-the-fossil-fuel-industry-doesn-t-want-you-to-know-al-gore", "transcript": {"en": "The most important question these days is how can we speed up\nthe solutions to the climate crisis? I'm convinced we are going\nto solve the climate crisis. We've got this. But the question remains,\nwill we solve it in time? Others have said we're kind of in a race. I'll give you the the shortest\ndefinition of the problem. If I was going to give a one-slide\nslide show, it would be this slide. That's the troposphere,\nthe lowest part of the atmosphere. And you already know why it's blue. That's the oxygen\nthat refracts the blue light. And if you could drive a car at highway\nspeed straight up in the air, you'd get to the top of that blue\nline in about five to seven minutes. You could walk it in an hour. And all of the greenhouse gas\npollution is below you. That's what we're using as an open sewer. That's the problem. And it's causing a lot of second\nand third order consequences. And we saw some of them\nin the northern-tier cities, including Detroit. This one's from New York City,\nall the fires in Canada. And we have gotten used to the fact\nthat the world suffers deep droughts and huge rain bombs and downpours\nand floods simultaneously. The really ingenious new\ngravity-measuring satellite has given us, for the first time, the opportunity to see\nhow this plays out worldwide. We get these huge surpluses of water, the rain bombs and the drought\nsimultaneously. And as you can see,\nthe amplitude is increasing. And at both ends of our planet right now,\nwe're seeing signs of distress. Of course, you know, I've often said, every night on the TV news\nis like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. And just today, big flooding in Montpelier, Vermont, in southern Japan, in India. And I haven't done a complete scan, but every single day, it's like that. But in Antarctica, some scientists who are normally\npretty levelheaded are getting a little bit freaked out,\nI would say, is a fair definition, about the lowest level ever,\nat this point in the year, of sea ice. And at the other pole,\nin the North Atlantic, we're seeing literally\noff-the-charts temperatures. So obviously, the crisis\nhas to be addressed. And the good news is,\nas others have often said, we are seeing tremendous progress. And it starts with the Inflation Reduction\nAct here in the United States. President Biden, the Congress,\nthey have passed the best, biggest climate legislation\nin all of history, and it's said to be 369 billion. But the heavy lifting\nis done by tax credits, and most of them are open-ended. And the early applications already show it's going to be well over\na trillion dollars, maybe 1.2 trillion. So this is really good news. And one month after that passed, Australia changed its government\nand started changing its laws. And it's now a pro-climate nation. A month after that,\nBrazil did the same thing, new president, new policies\nprotecting the Amazon. And throughout, the European Union\nhas resisted the efforts of Russia to blackmail it into supporting its sadistic and cruel\ninvasion of Ukraine. And there are other signs\nof success as well. China's reached its renewables target\nfive years ahead of time. It's still building a lot of coal,\nbut only 50 percent capacity utilization. So there is lots of good news. But still, in spite of this progress, the emissions are still going up. And the crisis is still getting worse faster than we are deploying\nthe solutions. So maybe it's time to look\nat the obstacles that are standing in our way. I'm going to focus on two\nof them this afternoon. First of all, the unrelenting opposition\nfrom the fossil fuel industry. A lot of people think\nthey're on side and trying to help. But let me tell you, and the activists will all tell you this, every piece of legislation,\nwhether it's at the municipal level, the regional or provincial level, the national level\nor the international level, they're in there with their lobbyists\nand with their fixers and with their revolving-door colleagues doing everything they can\nto slow down progress. So speeding up progress means\ndoing something about this. They have used fraud on a massive scale. They’ve used falsehoods\non an industrial scale. And they’ve used their legacy political\nand economic networks, lavishly funded, to capture the policy-making process\nin too many countries around the world. And the [UN] Secretary General said the fossil fuel industry is the polluted\nheart of the climate crisis. Now, that's not to say that the men\nand women who've worked in fossil fuel for the last century and a half\nare not due our gratitude. They are, and they didn't cause this. But for decades now, the companies\nhave had the evidence. They know the truth, and they consciously\ndecided to lie to publics all around the world in order to calm down\nthe political momentum for doing something about it\nso they can make more money. It's simple as that. (Applause) And now they have brazenly seized\ncontrol of the COP process, especially this year's COP in Dubai\nin the United Arab Emirates. And concern has been building\nabout this for quite some time. I remember when there were so many\nfossil fuel delegates in Madrid, but by the time we got to Glasgow\na year and a half ago, the delegates from\nthe fossil fuel companies made up a larger group\nthan the largest national delegation. And why? Why? Because they're helping? They're not helping,\nthey're trying to stop progress. And last year in Egypt, they had more delegates\nthan the combined delegations of the ten most affected\ncountries by climate. And now this year's host,\nwhich is a petro state, has appointed the president of COP28, in spite of the fact that he has\na blatant conflict of interest, he's the CEO of the Abu Dhabi\nNational Oil Company owned by Abu Dhabi. Their emissions are larger\nthan those of ExxonMobil, and they have no credible plan\nwhatsoever to reduce them. So this is the person\nin charge of the COP. He's a nice guy. He's a smart guy. But a conflict of interest\nis a conflict of interest. And a matter of fact, they have a plan now to have\na new increase in their emissions. Their plan is to increase\nthe production of both oil and gas by as much as 50 percent by 2030. Which is the same time frame when the world is trying\nto reduce emissions, by 50 percent by 2030. And the same person has been put in charge\nof both of those efforts. Direct conflict of interest. I think it's time to say, wait a minute, do you take us for fools? Do you think you can just completely\nremove the disguise and we won't notice? The fossil fuel industry has captured\nthis process and is slowing it down. And we need to do something about it. Now, they plan to increase\ntheir emissions -- (Applause) Getting all hot and bothered here. (Laughter) The head of the International\nEnergy Agency was talking about several oil companies who have publicly pledged\nto increase their oil and gas and simultaneously pledged\nto comply with the Paris Agreement. Do you take us for fools? You cannot do both\nof those things simultaneously. And if you think we believe you\nwhen you say that, we beg to differ. Last year at the COP, the fossil fuel petro states vetoed any mention of phasing down fossil fuels. They say, oh, that's not the problem. One of the secretary of state\nequivalent in Saudi Arabia said, we don't see this\nas a discussion about fossil fuels. Let me tell you, the climate crisis\nis a fossil fuel crisis. The solutions are going\nto come from a discussion and collaboration\nabout phasing out fossil fuels. And there's only so much longer\nthey can hold this up and tie us down and keep us\nfrom doing the right thing. Now the director general\nof this year's COP, working under Sultan Al Jaber,\nhe worked for ADNOC also, he was seconded for several\nyears to ExxonMobil. He said, no, that’s all changed.\nThis year, they’ve changed. The fossil fuel companies\nare really engaging us. They have changed. Yes, they have changed. They've changed for the worse this year. You don't believe me? Look at this, BP. They said, \"We're going to net zero,\nthere's no turning back.\" A few months ago this year,\nthey turned back and they decided to roll back\ntheir investments. ExxonMobil. Oh, my God. This is minor compared to their\nindustrial-scale lying, you know. But they've had all the TV ads on,\nparticularly in the US, about revolutionizing biofuels. \"You wouldn't believe what algae can do.\" Well, for 14 years they ran this program. And they spent 50 percent\nas much on the ads about the program as they did on actually trying\nto come up with new biofuels. And then a couple of months ago,\nthey said, \"Oh, we've changed our mind. We're just going to cancel that program.\" The industry as a whole has not been acting in good faith. Shell reversed its commitment to increase\ntheir investments in fossil fuels. They announced just a couple of months ago\nthey're going to plow that money into expanding oil and gas\nproduction instead. So did they miss the memo? Well, no, they say\nthey've discovered a way out. They're telling us now\nthat the problem is not fossil fuels. It's the emissions from fossil fuels. And so all we have to do is to capture\nthe emissions from the fossil fuels. Now, I'm all for research and development into trying to capture emissions or sucking it out of the air\nif they want to do that. But let's don't pretend it's for real. Maybe someday it will be. Maybe someday it will be. (Applause) This is the head of ExxonMobil\nsaying, \"Not oil and gas, it's the emissions.\" And Abu Dhabi, they have said they've already\ndecreased their emissions from producing oil and gas, 99.2 percent. The point two makes it sound\neven more authoritative. (Laughter) Is that feasible? Have they really done that? Is their carbon capture technology\nthat’s that good? Well, Climate TRACE can measure. Now, let's just look. There's their CCS capability. Oh, but they've got a great\nimprovement in the work. Seven years from now, they're going to have a 500 percent\nincrease in their capacity. But here are the emissions\nfrom oil and gas production alone. And here are the emissions\nof greenhouse gases from Abu Dhabi, from the UAE. Now, the pathetic little sliver there compared to the reality, again, do they think we don't see\nwhat they're doing, don't understand what they're doing? A lot of people maybe just want\nto look away from it. Pretty ironic here in this country. You know, the coal-burning utilities have been given a new mandate\nthis year by the EPA. You've got to clean up your act. Now, you can keep on burning coal and you can keep on\nproducing electricity with it if you use carbon capture\nand sequestration. Well, they scream bloody murder. Another story about it this morning, but they say, that technology? That's not feasible. It's not technically feasible,\nnot economically feasible. So they need to get\ntheir story straight, in my opinion. So the technology of CCS has been around for a long time, 50 years, and we get used to technologies\nautomatically getting cheaper and better, you know, with the computer chips\nand the cell phones and all that. Well, University of Oxford\ndid a whole study, and some come down\nin cost fast, some slow. A few are in a category called\nnon-improving technologies. And that’s where carbon\ncapture and storage is. 50 years, not any price decline. Well, could we get\na breakthrough in spite of that? Maybe. We're throwing a lot of money at it. We had to do that to get the compromise\nthat passed the IRA, and we ought to continue the research. But again, let's don't pretend\nthat it's here. It's not here now. And to use it as an excuse,\nand now they've got another one. Now it's called direct air capture. These are giant vacuum cleaners\nthat use an awful lot of energy. It's technically feasible,\nbut it's extremely expensive. And it also uses so much energy. But it is tremendously useful. You know what it's used for? The CEO of one of the largest\noil companies in the US had told us what it's useful for. It's useful to give them an excuse\nfor not ever stopping oil. A few months later, she said, \"This gives us, this new technology,\na license to continue operating.\" Some people call that a moral hazard. For them, the moral hazard is not a bug, it's a feature, as the old saying goes. And so let's just look,\nthis is state-of-the-art. It looks pretty impressive, doesn't it? This is the backside\nof one of these machines. (Laughter) I had the same thought. (Laughter) Now this, they're improving this. (Applause) They're improving this. And the new model, seven years from now, each of these machines\nis going to be able to capture 27 seconds' worth\nof annual emissions. Woohoo. That gives them a license\nto continue producing more and more oil and gas. Or so they claim. Well, they also say, the experts, that in order to be economically feasible, it has to come in\nat 100 dollars a ton or less. The leading company says\nthat 27 years from now, it may come down below\nthree times that amount. So again, if this sounds\nkind of incredible, it is not credible. But they're using it\nin order to gaslight us, literally. But I didn't mean it as a pun,\nbut that's what they're using it to do. And we can't fall for it. The biggest obstacle to direct\nair capture is probably physics. And what I mean by that,\nthey've explained this to me. CO2 makes up 0.035 percent of the air so we're going to vacuum\nthe other 99.96 percent to get that little bit out. Come on, really? Come on. And it doesn't even pretend\nto catch the methane or the soot or the mercury\nor the particulate pollution that kills 9 million people a year\naround the world. And that's why the climate\njustice advocates are so down on this kind of nonsense. They say, here's one of them says,\nlook, we need to fight climate change, but don't do it by pretending to do it\nand continue dumping all this pollution on the front line communities\nthat are downwind from the smokestacks. And that's why they have not ever\nreally liked the carbon capture. And what about all\nthe energy that's needed? Is it going to come\nfrom more fossil fuels? Well, in case of Occidental, yes. But could it come\nfrom more solar and wind? Well, if so, why not use\nthe solar and wind to replace the fossil fuel-burning plants that are putting all that stuff\nup there in the first place? Doesn't that make sense? Am I missing something? (Applause) Anyway, this is the environmental\njustice advocate who is making the point that you can't do it without protecting\nthose who are victimized downwind from the smokestacks,\ndownstream from the pollution. Now, some of the companies, of course, you say we're going\nto offset our emissions. And again, offsets can play\na role, a small role, five to 10 percent according\nto the Science Based Targets initiative, the most authoritative source\non all of this. But, you know, Chevron\njust had its offsets analyzed. It turned out 93 percent of them\nwere worthless and junk. And that's too often the case. It's not a get-out-of-jail-free card. And their offsets were only aimed\nat 10 percent of their emissions in the first place. Eighty percent\nof the fossil fuel companies just completely ignore\nthe Scope Three emissions, which is the main part\nof their pollution problem. So they say that they\nhave increased by 400 percent the share of their spending on energy that goes to green technologies\nand carbon capture. And yes, they have, they've increased\nit all the way up to four percent. And it's not even as good as that, because if you look at the windfall\nprofits they've been getting, what have they done with that? Well, they gave it back\nto the shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. So the amount of money the fossil fuel industry\nis investing in renewables and carbon capture is one percent. Does that mean they are sincere actors,\nworking in good faith? I don't think so. A lot of people still think so. They think they're on our side. I don't think it's in their nature\nto be on our side. I think they're driven by incentives\nthat push them in the opposite direction. But in any case, they produce no solutions\nwhatsoever that are scalable or remotely feasible. And again, they have actively fought against the solutions that others\nhave been trying to bring. I've seen it personally. Many of you have seen it personally. And it's happening all over the world. No progress. They've even gone backwards. Now, if a company says, look, we shouldn't be excluded\nfrom the COP process, we know a lot about energy. Here's a simple test. Do they actually have, does the company have\nreal net-zero commitments, a genuine phase-down plan, yes or no? Are they committed to full disclosure? Yes or no? Are they going to spend\nwindfall profits on the transition? Yes or no? Are they committed to transparency? Will they end their anti-climate lobbying? Will they end their greenwashing? Will they be in favor\nof reforming the COP process so that the petro states\ndon't have an absolute veto on anything the world wants\nto discuss or act on? We've got to change that. In order to move faster, we have got to empower\nthe global community in a way that frees them\nfrom the hammerlock that the fossil fuel companies\nhave on them today. And any company\nthat doesn't pass this test, I'm telling you, ought to be prohibited from taking\npart in the COP process. (Cheers and applause) What about the company that's led\nby the president of this year's COP, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company? Well, it's rated one\nof the least responsible of all the oil and gas companies. It no longer even releases information on any of its emissions,\nhas no transition plan, no short or mid-term target scores, a pathetic three on 100-scale\non their transition plans. And the nation's plan\nis rated highly insufficient. They just put out a new one,\nit's still insufficient. So that's the first obstacle. Second one's a lot clearer. This one has to be removed\nin order to get to the faster solutions. But in order to remove it, we've got to do something\nabout the second obstacle, and that is the financial system, the global allocation of capital\nand the subsidies for fossil fuels. Governments last year around the world\nsubsidized with taxpayer money more than a trillion dollars,\nsubsidizing fossil fuels. That's five times larger\nthan the amount in 2020. Are we going in the right direction\nor the wrong direction? Well, there are a lot\nof good things I'll show you, but this has to stop. And the 60 largest global banks have put 5.5 trillion extra dollars into the fossil fuel companies\nsince the Paris agreement. And preposterously, 49 of them\nhave also signed net-zero pledges. So we ... Global allocation of capital. The borrowing of private\ncapital is ruled out for many developing countries. Nigeria has to pay an interest rate\nseven times higher than Europe or the US. Political risk, corruption risk,\ncurrency risk, off-take risk, it's rule of law risk. That's why the World Bank and the other\nmultilateral development banks are supposed to take\nthose top layers of risk off. And that's why we need\nreform in the World Bank. Thank goodness so many fought\nto get a new head of the World Bank, and I'm very excited about his progress. Now, when these obstacles are removed,\nwe can really accelerate progress. They'll still be problems, of course, but we have everything we need and proven deployment models\nto reduce emissions 50 percent in the next seven years. But we will still need better grids, more resilient grids, more solar and wind, much more regenerative agriculture. That's a way to really pull\ncarbon out of the air. More electric vehicles\nand charging stations and more energy storage. I'll show you that just\nbefore we quit here. And more green hydrogen,\nso more electrolyzers to produce it. And these are all surmountable obstacles. Already, renewables account for 90 percent of all the new electricity generation\nbeing installed each year worldwide. Ninety-three percent solar\nand wind in India last year. And of course, the solar's\ntaking off and so is wind and so are the electric vehicles\nand battery storage. It has grown so dramatically. You’ve got to rescale the graph to look\nat the trillion-dollar industry emerging. Now, just seven years ago,\nthere was one gigafactory. I learned from one of you\nat a session a couple of hours ago and had my staff research it, there are now 195 gigafactories\nand another 300 in the pipeline. So will we succeed? Some people fight\nwith a vulnerability to despair. You know, the old cliche, “denial\nain’t just a river in Egypt.” Despair ain’t just a tire in the trunk. There are people that are vulnerable. But let me close with what I regard\nas amazingly good news. What if we could stop\nthe increase in temperatures? Well, if you look\nat the temperature increases, if we get to true net-zero, astonishingly, global temperatures\nwill stop going up with a lag time of as little\nas three to five years. They used to think that positive feedback\nloops would keep that process going. No, it will not. The temperatures will stop going up. The ice will continue melting\nand some other things will continue, but we can stop\nthe increase of temperatures. Even better, if we stay at true net zero,\nin as little as 30 years, half of all the human-caused CO2\nwill come out of the atmosphere into the upper ocean\nand the trees and vegetation. So young people are demanding\nthat we do the right thing. Do not be vulnerable to despair. We are going to do this. And if you doubt that we,\nas human beings have the will to act, please always remember that the will to act\nis itself a renewable resource. Thank you very much. (Cheers and applause) Thank you."}, "multiple-choice": []}

The early bird rises with the sun,\nspringing out of bed abuzz with energy. As the day goes on, they slowly get\nmore and more exhausted until finally crashing around sunset. Meanwhile, the night owl rises\nlong after the sun, stumbling groggily from their bed. After about 30 minutes—\nor a cup of coffee— they begin to come to life. But they don’t really hit their stride\nuntil later in the day, at which point they comfortably\ncoast past sunset, only heading to bed in the early hours\nof the morning. For many, this is a familiar story,\nand one that’s easy to cast yourself in. But how many people are truly\nnight owls or early birds? And are our natural sleep schedules\npredetermined at birth, or can we change them? The truth is there’s a lot of space\nbetween these extremes, and most people fall somewhere\nin the middle. These behaviors are determined\nby our circadian system— which is anchored by a pair\nof nerve cell clusters located in the anterior hypothalamus. These nerve cells respond to light\nexposure coming in through your eyes to track the day-night cycle that dictates\nyour body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm. That steady rhythm helps determine\nthe body’s flow of hormones, with the broader circadian system\nacting like a conductor that keeps your organs functioning\nin time with one another. And a major part of that performance\nis managing the body’s transitions between being awake and being asleep. Now, your circadian system can't just\ndecide its bedtime and knock you out. However, by tracking how much\nlight you typically get and when in your waking hours\nyou usually get it, the system can make predictions about\nwhen you’re likely to need sleep and prepare your body accordingly. For example, if you consistently\ngo to sleep around 10 pm, your circadian system will start producing\nsleep-inducing melatonin around two hours before then\nto tell your body it’s time for bed. So if this rhythm is molded\nby our sleep habits, can we change it just by sticking\nto a strict schedule? To a degree. Everyone’s bodies are unique, so even two people with the same sleep\nschedule might have different experiences based on their circadian system’s \nhormonal quirks. For example, where early birds generally\nflood with cortisol just before waking up, night owls often have their cortisol peak\nroughly 30 minutes after getting up. Hormonal differences like these determine\nhow you experience your circadian rhythm. And while these factors\ncan shift with age, you’re unlikely to grow out of your body’s\npreferred sleep schedule. That said, you can cultivate habits\nto help or hinder your circadian rhythm. Keeping consistent sleeping hours helps\nyour body accurately predict when to send out hormones, making it easier to stick\nto your schedule. Conversely, research in sleep deprived\ncollege students has found their unpredictable\nsleeping habits weaken their entire circadian system. Compromised circadian rhythms\nare less effective at coordinating organ functioning\nand can incur health risks like metabolic disorders\nand vulnerable immune systems. But perhaps just as important\nas sleep hygiene is light hygiene. Getting sufficient contrast between\nbright daylight and dimmer nighttime light is essential for synchronizing\nyour circadian rhythm, and nothing establishes this contrast\nbetter than sunlight. Even on overcast days, sunlight is much\nbrighter than standard indoor lighting. So if you're typically\nawake during the day, try getting outside as soon as possible\nto teach your body when to be active and alert. It’s difficult to maintain\na sleep schedule that pushes against your\nbody’s preferences. And even if you succeed for months, it only takes one bad night to send\nyour circadian system back to baseline. But whether you’re an early bird,\nnight owl, or somewhere in between, it’s important to remember\nthat as long as you’re consistent, there’s no wrong time\nto wake up or go to sleep. What matters most is getting enough rest\nfor the day ahead."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The circadian systems that determine our sleep patterns are anchored by nerve cell clusters that respond to ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Light"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sound"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Color"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Air pressure"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How does your circadian system affect your sleep schedule?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It puts your body to sleep at a regular hour."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It predicts when you're likely to need sleep."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It cannot be altered past the age of 24."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It determines your caffeine tolerance."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If your body floods with cortisol just before waking up, you would likely be classified as ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An early bird"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A night owl"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Neither a nor b"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both a and b"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following actions would weaken your circadian rhythm?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Keeping consistent sleeping hours"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Experiencing daily contrast between day light and nighttime light"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Going for a walk outside during the day"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Studying all night for an exam"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the most important factor in maintaining a strong circadian rhythm?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Waking up early"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Going to bed early"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Keeping a consistent sleep schedule"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sleeping only when it's dark outside"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 120, "lesson": 5, "title": "Does COVID mess with your DNA?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/s0CbW86v", "transcript": {"en": "I know a lot of us are, like, ignoring COVID now. Sure it’s still a thing out there you can catch, but most people seem tired of hearing about it. But not only is COVID not going anywhere – for some people, infection is followed by a protracted, debilitating condition known \ninformally as long COVID. The good news is that scientists \nare hard at work on solving that. And while we don’t know \nwhat causes long COVID yet, we’re getting closer to \nunderstanding what’s involved, which points at ways to treat it. Today, let’s talk about one area \nwhere we’ve made some progress. And it has to do with sticky notes on your DNA. [Intro Music] Symptoms of long COVID vary \ndramatically between individuals, but depending on who you ask, it’s defined as experiencing \nsigns of illness somewhere between 4 weeks and 3 months following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These effects can be devastating, and have dramatic effects on \na patient's quality of life, including their ability to work. Now, there is a flurry of interest in this topic – which is great! and you can find scientists looking at everything from the heart to the brain to the lungs to the everywhere. But a few research groups are thinking smaller. Way smaller, down to the fine print and the genes that dictate \nour response to infection. While most every cell in your body has the same sequence of DNA in its nucleus, there are a lot of ways for the cell to decide what genes to use when. They don’t all get used the same \namount, or at the same rate. Think of it like a textbook that \nyou don’t read cover to cover. You’re probably going to reference \nsome important sections more often, and skip over others that \nare less relevant to you. You might even use sticky notes to mark a page you want to come back to often. Well, cells have their own version of \nsticky notes in their genetic libraries. Genes may get marked up with tags that tell the cell’s machinery to \nuse that gene more or less often. This is the basis for the science of epigenetics a way for the cell to modulate genetic information without changing the sequence of DNA. The kind of epigenetic sticky note we’re going to be talking about \nis called DNA methylation. The best-understood version of methylation usually adds a tag to quiet the gene down, causing it to be read out less \noften than it would otherwise. And we have good reason to think the virus that causes COVID-19 may affect epigenetic signals in our cells. Back in 2017, before anyone had ever heard the word “COVID”, researchers were looking into the epigenetic \neffects of SARS and MERS infections, which are both coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2. It's unlikely that the virus is moving genetic sticky notes itself  Rather, the thinking seems to be that our own bodies produce more or less of the products of certain genes to make infection less severe. In long COVID, research is starting to suggest that the changes to these signals persist when the body should have scaled \nthem back after infection. And here’s the thing – we can read these epigenetic signals. So if we can identify genes whose signals are consistently changed in \npatients with long COVID, we might be able to both \ndiagnose long COVID more easily, and shake those genes down for answers about how to treat those patients. A research group based in Sweden has studied DNA methylation in the blood cells of patients with long COVID. In the study, published in the \njournal Clinical Epigenetics in 2022. they found several genes and groups of genes with changes in their methylation after infection. These included some seriously tantalizing hits: genes involved in regulating ACE2, the now-famous protein that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to invade cells. Some genes were also involved \nin histamine signaling, which lines up with the evidence that some antihistamine medications can benefit long COVID patients. Most intriguing, some of these methylated genes were related to taste and smell, which makes sense given that one of COVID’s signature symptoms is loss of those senses. Before we get too excited, though, this was a small study with \nonly 10 long COVID patients. So while it isn’t as robust as we would like, that’s unfortunately the case for \na lot of COVID-related research because it’s just so new. Another research group, this one based in the US, looked at patients recovering from COVID in a pair of papers between 2021 and 2022. They had a total of 102 participants with COVID in their first study, and followed up one year later with 15 of them who reported symptoms of long COVID. They also found changes in DNA methylation that persisted after infection… but in pretty much totally different \ngenes than the Swedish study identified. Their previous study had found about 1500 genes whose methylation status changed during acute COVID-19 infection. Of those, 71 remained altered a year later. Broadly speaking, those genes tended to be related to inflammation and response to infection. Basically, a totally different group of genes than what the Swedish team found, although at least some of those \ngenes had similar functions. Unfortunately, not all of the studies on \nmethylation and long COVID have supported a connection between them. A third study found no difference in methylation between people with long \nCOVID and people in remission. These studies were all on the smaller side, with tons of differences between the patients who participated in them. But just for fun, let’s revisit a few of the methylated genes that those studies did find. Because they do all seem relevant to long COVID if larger studies can validate their involvement. For example, the US-based group says that the pattern of \ngene expression they found could help to explain the increase in cardiovascular events that follows COVID-19. And the Swedish group identified \ngenes related to ACE2, which interestingly lines \nup with an idea out there that patients develop antibodies to their own ACE2 after infection, which might contribute to \ninflammation occurring in long COVID. Even more interestingly, this group also noticed that their patients had some \nsimilar self-antibodies floating around to patients with MECFS – what you might know as chronic fatigue syndrome. And they noticed epigenetic changes to \nthose self-antibody receptors as well. I don’t want to get too excited \nabout such a small study, but the evidence for a link between long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome is piling up everywhere you look. And what’s better than understanding one disease? Understanding two. So while it’s early days for this research, there’s a lot going on in the world \nof COVID-19 epigenetic studies, and studies of COVID-19 in general. But as we discover more about \nhow this spiky little virus is messing with our sticky notes, we can hopefully find ways to get \nour DNA textbooks back in order.

In New Zealand, divers swat off millions\nof stinging jellyfish each no larger than a grain of pepper. In Sweden, a massive cluster\nof moon jellyfish shut down one of the world’s largest\nnuclear reactors by clogging the plant’s essential pipes. And in the Sea of Japan, thousands\nof 200 kilogram Nomura’s jellyfish with bells two meters in diameter\nswarm fishermen, snapping nets and devouring local fish. Around the world, these animals\nvoraciously consume fish eggs and larvae, routinely undermine\nmarine farming efforts, and outcompete adult fish by consuming\nthe resources they need to survive. If things stay on their\ncurrent trajectory, we could be headed for a future where\nthe entire ocean is thick with jellyfish. So, is there anything that can keep these\ngelatinous creatures under control? Enter, the humble sea turtle. There are a wide range of marine animals\nthat feed on jellyfish, but sea turtles are among\ntheir most ancient predators. And while every known species\nof sea turtle preys on jellyfish at some point in their lives, none consume quite as many\nas the leatherback. Leatherbacks are the largest species\nof sea turtle, and they eat jellyfish almost exclusively, devouring well over 1,000 metric tons of\nthem over their roughly 50-year lifespans. This is particularly remarkable\nbecause jellyfish are 95% water and very low in calories, so to maintain a healthy weight, the average 500 kilogram leatherback needs to eat roughly 400 kilograms\nof jellyfish every day. That’s roughly the same weight\nas a grand piano. And while some sea turtle species\nhave been documented selectively eating their preys’\nprotein-rich gonads, leatherbacks eat jellyfish whole— mowing down huge swaths\nof unsuspecting jellies. Normally, jellyfish aren't\nquite this defenseless. Most species have tentacles covered\nin cells called cnidocytes, which contain venomous harpoons\ncoiled and ready to launch. These barbed structures, \nknown as nematocysts, are released on contact. Jellyfish frequently use this sting\nto paralyze and kill their food, and it can also irritate the skin\nof would-be intruders. But it's completely useless\nagainst sea turtles. Most of these reptiles have thick\nscales covered in keratin— the same material that makes\nup nails and claws. This leathery armor protects\ntheir skin while they hunt, and any captured prey that tries\nto escape is impaled on the keratinized spikes\nlining the leatherback’s esophagus. For most sea turtles, these adaptations\nmake individual jellyfish easy prey. However, a jelly population’s\ntrue defense mechanism is in how quickly they can reproduce. Almost all jellyfish species have evolved\nto reproduce both sexually and asexually, allowing them to increase their numbers\nwith or without a partner. In tropical environments, jellyfish reproduce constantly\nthroughout the year. But in more temperate climates, species often reproduce all at once\nin a massive bloom, where jellies multiply at alarming rates. And humanity is making these blooms\nmuch more frequent. Fertilizer runoff from farms\nintroduces chemicals that simultaneously kill other fish\nand prompt blooms. High water temperatures\ncaused by climate change speed up jellyfish reproduction\nand extend the reproductive season. Meanwhile, both marine\nconstruction and pollution dramatically increase the surface area\nfor jellyfish polyps to attach, grow, and mature. All these issues require a wide range\nof policy-based solutions. But one major way to prevent jellyfish\npopulations from getting out of hand is to protect their natural predators— many of whom are currently under threat. Small-scale fisheries that are essential\nto communities in Mexico and Peru often use gillnets, which unintentionally capture and kill\nhundreds of sea turtles each year. In the Eastern Pacific, these practices\ncould drive leatherbacks to extinction in the next 60 years. Fortunately, some researchers have already\ndeveloped inexpensive tools to minimize these risks. Attaching green LED lights to gillnets\nhas proven useful for allowing sea turtles, dolphins,\nand even seabirds to avoid fishing gear.

Suddenly, an alligator hurtles out of the\nwater at almost 50 kilometers an hour, locking its jaws around its prey and swinging wildly in a signature move\nknown as the death roll. This deer never stood a chance, but then, nothing in this region can\ncompete with this apex predator. These alligators easily devour\nthe birds, turtles, and small fish living in what’s known today\nas Everglades National Park. But despite ruling the swamp\nfor millennia, the last 500 years have brought\ndeadly new predators that challenge the alligators’ reign. And the origins of these international\ninvaders are just as unexpected as their impact on the Everglades. We tend to think of swamps\nas hostile landscapes since they’re overflowing\nwith plant and animal life. But all this biodiversity makes these\nenvironments vital to regional food webs. And the Everglades are no exception. The park's subtropical climate can support\nspecies from around the world, and its borders are full of ecotones—\ntransition areas between habitats— that connect the region’s\nfreshwater prairies, rocky pinelands, mangrove forests,\nand more. Human activity has made the region\neven more biodiverse, developing Florida into a major port that welcomes countless human\nand non-human migrants. In the 1500s, Spanish colonizers\nbrought wild boar to the area, which quickly multiplied\nand uprooted the wetlands. They devoured alligator eggs and spread\nEuropean parasites to local panthers. Then, in the 1800s,\nFlorida’s shipping industry exploded, bringing all manner\nof new invasive species. Brazilian peppertrees blocked out the sun,\nwater hyacinths clogged the rivers, and brown anole lizards\nupset the food chain. Alligator populations mostly\nendured this onslaught, but in the late 19th century, human intervention kicked\nthings up a notch. Government and business officials wanted\nto turn the Everglades into farmland and began building canals\nto drain the swamp. They also planted non-native trees\nwhich crowded out the plants local birds relied on for\nfood and shelter, which in turn limited\nthe alligators’ supply of prey. Interventions like this wreaked havoc\non the Everglades for decades, until a conservationist named \nMarjory Stoneman Douglas finally came to their defense. In 1947, Douglas published a landmark book\nexplaining that the Everglades were not only a unique\nand precious ecosystem, but that the region’s most fearsome\nresidents were actually vital to sustaining it. During the wet season, alligators are constantly shaping\nthe muddy landscape, drawing lines with their bodies and digging holes\nwith their snouts, claws, and tails. In the dry season, these indentations become essential\nwatering holes and firebreaks, maintaining and protecting\nthe swamp’s other residents. In the wake of Douglas’ book,\nEverglades National Park was established to formally begin protecting\nthe landscape and its scaly stewards. But outside the park, conditions were brewing\nfor the most dangerous invasion yet. Over the next 40 years,\nthe exotic pet trade brought parakeets, iguanas,\nand relatives of piranhas to the region. In the 1990s, Burmese pythons became\na cheap, popular pet for many Floridians. Some snake owners released their pets\ninto the wild when they grew too large. But the python population\nreally exploded in 1992 when a hurricane destroyed\na breeding facility and released countless snakes\ninto the wild. Since then, pythons have been\nconnected to a 90% decrease in some local mammal populations, decimating the alligators’ food supply. And with help from other invasive\nreptiles like black and white tegus— giant lizards who devour alligator eggs— these snakes have made a serious play\nfor the top of the local food chain. Today, Florida ranks among the regions\nwith the most invasive species in the world. Some researchers suggest\nhunting these invaders down, while others recommend bringing in yet\nmore creatures to balance the scales, such as releasing insects\nto eat invasive plants. It might seem absurd to try solving\nthis problem with more foreign fauna. But perhaps a new arrival could\nfight invaders and feed the alligators— giving them the boost they need\nto reclaim their ancient home."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In the 1500s, Spanish colonizers brought what wild animal to Florida, which quickly multiplied and disturbed the wetlands?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wild boar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Burmese pythons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A piranha relative"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Parakeets"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Since the 1992 invasion of the pythons, there has been a(n) ___ decrease in some local mammal populations, decimating the alligators’ food supply.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "40%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "80%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "90%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Plants can be invasive just like animals.

Many cited potential health\nand environmental benefits as their motivation. But are these alternative meats actually\nbetter for us and the planet? First, let’s introduce the contenders. Meat from butchered animals,\nwhich we’ll call farmed meat, is a complex structure of muscle fibers,\nconnective tissues, and fat. You may recognize meat\nfrom its role in the human diet, stretching back to our species’\nvery beginnings. Our next challenger, \nthe plant-based meat alternative, may look and taste like meat, but it’s built with proteins,\ncarbohydrates, fats, and other molecules from plants. Transforming plant molecules\ninto something that resembles meat takes effort. Meat’s fibrous texture is created\nby long rod-like proteins. To replicate this structure, a plant’s ball-shaped proteins can be\npushed through an extruder device which forces them to unwind\nand join into long filaments. To mimic animal fat, companies mix\nin fats and oils extracted from plants. One popular brand adds\na beet juice pigment that changes the patty’s color\nas it cooks. Another adds an iron-containing molecule\ncalled heme, which their team says\nis key to its meaty flavor. The resulting products come in many forms. Finally, our last entrant:\nlab-grown meat. Also known as cell-based meat\nand cultured meat, these products begin as animal stem cells that researchers coax to multiply\nand form into muscle. It’s worth noting that lab-grown meats\nare largely still in development, so the exact process may change\nwhen they’re produced at greater commercial scale. So which meat or lookalike\nis best for your health? Farmed meat is a vital source of protein\nand nutrients for many people. But researchers have also found links\nbetween diets high in red and processed meats and health concerns like\ntype 2 diabetes and heart disease. One 2012 study concluded\nthat swapping red meat for other options like chicken, nuts,\nor legumes for one meal a day can potentially reduce mortality risk\nby 7 to 19%. There is not enough data to know\nwhether replacing red meat with a plant-based patty\nwould have the same effect. Plant-based meats, while containing\njust as much protein, calories, and iron as farmed meat, are highly processed and, therefore,\nhigh in sodium. And many contain coconut oil,\nwhich has a lot of saturated fat, and, like red meat,\nmay elevate heart disease risk. Lab-grown meat, meanwhile, has the potential to offer the same\nnutritional qualities and health risks as farmed meat. But we won’t know for sure until\nproduct development is further along. So which contender is better\nfor the environment? Animal agriculture generates\nan estimated 14.5% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers estimate that producing\nplant-based meat substitutes results in, on average, around 90% less\ngreenhouse gas emissions than an equivalent amount of beef, 63% less than pork,\nand 51% less than poultry. Plant-based meat alternatives also tend\nto require far less land and water than farmed meat. And their production results in much lower\nlevels of pollutants running off farms and entering waterways— which threaten both the environment\nand public health. As for lab-grown meat, today the industry largely takes\nits stem cells from the muscle tissue of livestock. But how many animals will be required\nfor these biopsies once production scales up? It also isn’t clear to what degree\nalternative meats will reduce the environmental impact\nof the farmed meats industry. What if, instead of replacing\nmeat with alternatives, people continue to consume\nthe same amount of farmed meat while also eating newer options? While the verdict is still out on which\nmeat is nutritionally superior, if you care about your personal\nimpact on animal welfare, public health, and the environment, plant-based meat tends to come out on top. And switching to meat alternatives doesn’t\nhave to be an all-or-nothing decision. In fact, a 2022 study estimated that\nforgoing red meat at just one meal a day can decrease your personal dietary\ncarbon emissions by as much as 48%."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In a 2021 survey of over 1000 Americans, how many of them said they had tried plant-based meat-alternatives?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nearly 1/3"}, {"label": "B", "text": "About 1/2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nearly 2/3"}, {"label": "D", "text": "About 3/4"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What process allows plant-based meats to have a similar texture to farmed meat?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By bringing the plants to near absolute-zero"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A plant's ball-shaped molecules are pushed through an extruder"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Plant molecules are mixed with chemicals"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Plant molecules and farmed meat molecules are essentially already similar"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the name of the iron-containing molecule that adds meat-like flavor to plant-based meats?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nucleotides"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Draculin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sulflower"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Heme"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Plant-based meats are better for your health than farmed meats.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}, {"label": "C", "text": "We don't know yet"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Alternative meats are better for the environment because", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Alternative meats emit less carbon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They use up less land and water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Alternative meats result in fewer pollutants running off farms, which harms the environment and public health"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Researchers soon realized they weren’t\nlooking at the victim of a recent climbing accident,\nas initially assumed, but the mummified body of a man\nwho’d lived about 5,300 years ago, who they came to call Ötzi the Iceman. One early theory for Ötzi’s alpine death\nwas that he was a local shepherd or hunter who got caught in bad weather and froze. However, a shocking discovery eventually\nrevealed his true cause of death and upended his story. So, what do we know about Ötzi? And how did he die? Over the millennia, the Alpine cold \nand sun protected Ötzi’s body from decomposition, \nfreezing and drying it out in cycles, and leaving critical clues\nfor researchers. Ötzi was about 160 centimeters tall,\nweighed some 50 kilograms, and died between 40- and 50-years-old. He led an active life but had\na strong genetic predisposition for cardiovascular diseases. His intestines were also parasitized\nby whipworms and his stomach contained\nulcer-causing bacteria, all of which might have caused\nsome unpleasant symptoms. He died hundreds of years before\nStonehenge and the Great Pyramid were constructed, around 3350 BCE. Ötzi lived during the late\nNeolithic Copper Age, when metal extraction\nand crafting practices were spreading throughout Eurasia. Indeed, along with stone arrowheads\nand knives, Ötzi carried an axe made of copper\nfrom what is now Tuscany. Swaths of his clothing were made\nof sheep and goat leather, and his diet included cultivated grains, all of which suggested that Ötzi’s people\nrelied on certain domesticated animals and crops. And when researchers \ninspected Ötzi’s skin with light ranging from infrared to UV, they found a total of 61 tattoos. Interestingly, the markings corresponded\nwith areas of Ötzi’s body where he probably experienced pain, like from degeneration observed\nin his knees, ankles, and spine. Researchers think that the tattoos\nmight have been intended as treatment— perhaps an early form of acupuncture. Close scrutiny also clarified\nthe circumstances of Ötzi’s death— and led to a tantalizing prehistoric\nmurder mystery. A decade into studying Ötzi,\na CT scan picked up a crucial detail: there was a flint arrowhead lodged\nin Ötzi’s left shoulder. Soon enough, researchers started piecing\nÖtzi’s final days together. A deep cut wound on Ötzi’s hand\nshowed initial signs of healing and must have occurred\njust days before his death. It was likely a defensive wound\nwhich indicated that Ötzi was attacked with a sharp blade\nbut fought back and survived. Ötzi may have dressed\nthe wound with bog moss, which has antiseptic properties\nand was found with his remains. Meanwhile, the types and location\nof pollen in Ötzi’s digestive tract indicated that it was spring\nor early summer and that his last three days were hectic. Ötzi seemed to be fleeing something. About 33 hours before his death, Ötzi was at an altitude\nof around 2,500 meters, near the timber line. Then, approximately 24 hours later, he descended to at least 1,200 meters,\nto a zone of warmth-loving trees. In his final hours, Ötzi reached\nan altitude of around 3,000 meters where grasses, sedges,\nand certain wildflowers dominated. His last meal included a large helping\nof dried wild ibex, roe deer, and grains. Then, despite Ötzi’s apparent efforts\nto escape the conflict, someone at a distant vantage\nshot him from behind. The arrow pierced a major artery\nand embedded itself in his left shoulder, causing extensive blood loss. Ötzi probably died soon after, his remains and all his belongings left\nundisturbed in the glacier for millennia. This 5,300-year-old cold case has offered\ninvaluable glimpses into the distant past. But the mystery of who exactly Ötzi was\nand why he was killed will probably never be solved— the tangible evidence for the act\ndegraded and carried away, lost to snow drifts long ago."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In which time period lived Ötzi, the Iceman?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Iron Age"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Copper Age"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bronze Age"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Middle Ages"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How did Ötzi die?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He was shot by an arrow."}, {"label": "B", "text": "He froze to death."}, {"label": "C", "text": "He died of food poisoning."}, {"label": "D", "text": "He died of old age."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "On the body of Ötzi were discovered a total of ___ tattoos.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "42"}, {"label": "B", "text": "53"}, {"label": "C", "text": "61"}, {"label": "D", "text": "78"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What material did Ötzi likely use as dressing for his wound?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Leather plaster"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Maple Leaf"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bog moss"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tree mushroom"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "At what altitude was Ötzi at the time of his death?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "About 1,200 meters"}, {"label": "B", "text": "About 2,500 meters"}, {"label": "C", "text": "About 3,000 meters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "About 4,000 meters"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 120, "lesson": 10, "title": "How to enter flow state", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-enter-flow-state", "transcript": {"en": "A tennis player wins\nher second straight set, feeling like she can predict\nher opponent's next move. A musician works to master\na chord progression, unfazed by mistakes as he repeatedly\nplays the same four bars. A scientist fails to notice her morning\nalarm blare from the next room, having analyzed data through the night. While each of these people is immersed\nin a different activity, requiring specific skills\nand knowledge sets, all three are experiencing\nwhat is known as flow— a unique mental state\nof effortless engagement. And while you may not be a scientist\nor professional athlete, anyone can find flow. This is a good thing, as those who more frequently \nexperience flow report higher levels of positive emotions, creativity,\nand feelings of accomplishment. Further, research has linked it\nto increased productivity, enhanced learning,\nand academic achievement. But what exactly is flow?\nAnd how can we find it in our daily lives? Flow is more than just concentrating\nor paying attention. Psychologists go so far as to define flow\nas an altered state of consciousness with several defining features. First, those in flow tend to feel\nso effortlessly engaged in a task that time seems to fly by. They are not easily distracted. In contrast with cycles\nof procrastination, when it can feel impossible\nto start an activity, during flow it can feel difficult to stop. Flow also tends to diminish feelings\nof worry or self-judgment, in turn fostering creativity. And people report experiencing a sense\nof oneness with what they’re doing, allowing for peak performance. Further, brain imaging studies have shown\nthat flow is accompanied by changes in neural activity, notably in regions that play a role in attention, self-awareness,\nand self-consciousness. Despite decades of research, \nmany questions still remain. How do the brains of those in flow compare to those in other states of consciousness,\nlike meditation? Does flow arising from physical\nactivities like sports recruit the same brain areas\nas more mental tasks like writing or math? And scientists are still working\nto understand why certain activities are more likely to elicit flow\nthan others. While we don't know for sure,\nthere are several theories. For example, people more often report\nfinding flow when doing things they find intrinsically motivating, meaning activities they find purpose,\nmeaning, or enjoyment in. This may include participating\nin a favorite hobby, but also tackling gratifying\nassignments at work, studying topics you find interesting,\nor even completing satisfying chores. Likewise, it may be more difficult\nto find flow in tasks you do only because you have to, \nnot because you want to. Other research suggests balancing\npersonal skill level with the activity’s challenge\nis key for finding flow. In other words, if a task is too easy,\nyou may get distracted or feel bored. If it’s too challenging,\nyou may become discouraged. The classically mesmerizing game\nof Tetris, for example, keeps skill-challenge levels in balance\nby increasing the fall speed of blocks as players get better at the game. Still, other studies suggest \nthat it’s most important that activities have clear goals and allow you to assess\nyour progress along the way. For example, practicing a song allows\nyou to gauge your performance with each note. This also may be why people find\nflow when playing games of chance, even though those games\ndon't require skill. Moment-to-moment feedback may be enough\nto motivate deep engagement. While no single protocol\ncan guarantee flow, there are steps you can take\nto increase your chances. Find a quiet environment free\nfrom distracting noises or devices. Break your tasks into small, specific\nsegments that are easy to track and learn from. Set clear end goals that are\nchallenging but not frustratingly so. If you find the task to be tedious, set additional parameters\nto up the stakes. For example, when cleaning your dishes, attempt to finish them all\nin a certain amount of time. When running, try to keep pace\nwith the beat of a song. Most importantly,\nand perhaps most frustratingly, don't focus too much on reaching flow. That sort of distraction might just\nprevent you from finding it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Flow is defined as ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A mental state of effortless engagement"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A channeling of high-level skills"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A state of perfect ease with a task"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A state that is not recorded in the brain's short-term memory"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Those who experience flow more frequently report higher levels of what?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mania and obsessive tendencies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Creativity and positive emotions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Confidence in social situations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sleep quality"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Research suggests that reaching a flow state during an activity depends on a balance of skill level with ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Challenge"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Motivation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Commitment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reward"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "During which of the following tasks would you be least likely to reach flow state?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Practicing a hard-earned solo on a musical instrument"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reading the latest installment of your favorite book series"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Completing an extra credit assignment your parents are making you do"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Putting together a work presentation about an original idea you're pitching to the boss"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How might you increase your chances of achieving flow?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Find a quiet space to work"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Break your task into small segments"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Set a clear end goal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

This particular atom first entered\nthe exosphere millions of years ago, and during its tenure on Earth, it’s spent time in the waves\nof the Atlantic Ocean, the ground soil of the Amazon, and even the steam rising\noff a boiling pot of spaghetti. But today, traveling 30 times faster\nthan the speed of sound, it overcomes the Earth’s gravitational\npull and escapes, joining the roughly 90 tons of material\nthat leak out of our atmosphere each day. This daily whale-sized atmospheric loss\nis just one example of how the Earth is leaking. Atoms, energy, and molecules seep\nfrom one layer of the planet to another. And for Earth, whose stability\nis necessary to sustain life, these leaks can seem troubling. To better understand the extent\nof the planet’s imperfect plumbing, and when it becomes a problem, let’s visit two more leakage sites. Our second spot takes us\nto the Earth’s surface, to a field in Central Appalachia. Below, a 1,500 meter deep shaft connects\nan oil reservoir with the Earth’s surface. The oil supply here is dried up,\nleaving the site neglected and abandoned. But this underground reservoir also houses\nthe potent greenhouse gas methane, which continues to travel up the shaft\nand escape through cracks and loose pipes. This leaky well joins the more than\n3 million abandoned wells scattered throughout the US, that collectively emit,\nby lower estimates, 280,000 metric tons of methane each year. Our final leakage point takes us deep\nwithin the innermost boundary of the Earth, the core. Heat, originating from the formation\nof our solar system, drives the rotation of liquid metal\naround the solid inner core. The motion, in turn,\ncreates the planet’s magnetic field, a barrier that protects it\nfrom cosmic radiation and solar wind. But the core isn't perfectly insulated,\nso heat constantly leaks, escaping to the surrounding mantle and driving plate tectonics\nand magmatic activity. As a result, the core’s outer molten metal\nis slowly solidifying. Once fully cooled,\nthe magnetic field will disappear, leaving us exposed\nto the Sun’s harshest rays. The Earth clearly has\nsome cracks and bleeds. Should we be worried? Thankfully, the immediate risks\nof our hydrogen leak are low. At its current rate, it would take \nover 150 billion years to lose all our hydrogen to space. The same goes for our core leak. Scientists estimate the core\nwon't completely cool for another 700 million \nto several billion years. Methane emissions, however, have the power to alter our Earth's\nclimate within the next decade. The gas’s unique structure efficiently\nabsorbs energy radiating off the Earth, trapping it in the atmosphere as heat. This gives methane incredible\nwarming potential, 86 times that of carbon dioxide. The impact of methane escaping\nfrom abandoned wells in the US is comparable to burning\n10 billion pounds of coal each year. As abandoned wells in most\nof the world’s top oil producers have yet to be extensively\ncounted or surveyed, the global emissions of all abandoned\nwells is likely much, much higher. And they join the estimated\n570 million tons of methane emitted by other anthropological\nand natural sources each year. Beyond their climate impact, these unsealed wells can leach methane\nand other toxic gases into nearby groundwater, contaminating drinking water\nand impacting local ecosystems. Luckily, non-producing oil wells can be\nplugged by pumping cement into their depths. While many state and federal governments\nrequire oil and gas companies to plug defunct wells, plugging comes at a high expense, so companies have historically\ndodged policies. For decades, these leaky, low-producing,\nand economically non-viable wells were sold off and abandoned. It's clear that oil and gas companies\nwon't fix this problem on their own. It'll take concerted governmental efforts, such as placing high fees\non methane emission and coordinated oversight on plugging, to make sure companies\nare held accountable. But the problem starts before\nthese wells are abandoned. Within the US, \nactive oil and gas production emits massive amounts of methane, about 28 times that of abandoned wells.

In fact, they were fossilized teeth— many belonging to a prehistoric species\nthat would come to be called megalodon, the biggest shark to ever live. So what was it like when megalodon\nruled the seas? And what brought this formidable\npredator to extinction? Because their skeletons\nwere cartilaginous, what remains of megalodons are\nmostly scattered clues, like some isolated vertebrae and\nlots of their enamel-protected teeth. Like many sharks, megalodons could shed\nand replace thousands of teeth over the course of their lives. Interestingly, some fossil sites harbor\nespecially high numbers of small megalodon teeth. Experts believe these were nurseries\nthat supported countless generations of budding megalodons. They grew up in sheltered \nand food-packed shallow waters before becoming unrivaled\nadult marine hunters. Looking at the similarities \nwith great white shark teeth, scientists estimate that megalodons might\nhave stretched up to 20 meters— three times longer than great whites. And during their reign, which began\naround 20 million years ago, megalodons lived just about everywhere, with individuals also potentially\nundertaking transoceanic migrations. The world was warmer and the ocean\nwas brimming with life. Otters and dugongs thrived \nin newly formed kelp forests, and baleen whales were\nat their most diverse. Megalodons had no shortage\nof high-energy, edible options. And it seems they were ambitious eaters. Generally, as carnivores consume\nprotein-rich meat, certain nitrogen isotopes accumulate\nin their tissues— including the enamel of their teeth. Analyzing megalodon teeth, scientists\nconfirmed they were apex predators that not only ate large prey species— but also other predators,\nperhaps even each other. In addition to megalodon’s teeth, researchers have access to one\nexceptionally well-preserved spinal column that comprises 141 vertebrae\nof a 46-year-old megalodon. A 3D model of the megalodon’s body\nsuggests that its stomach could reach volumes\nof almost 10,000 liters— big enough to fit an entire orca. Reconstructing their jaws,\nresearchers think megalodons could eat a now-extinct 7-meter sperm whale\nin as few as four bites. And the fossilized bones of ancient\ncetaceans do indeed show evidence of megalodon bite marks— \nincluding some that healed over, confirming that megalodons\npursued live prey. But if megalodons were so powerful,\nwhy did they go extinct? It seems there were a few\ncontributing factors. By the time they disappeared\naround 3.5 million years ago, the global climate had cooled, causing more glaciers to form\nand the sea level to drop. This dried up many coastal habitats, meaning some of the world’s most\nresource-rich marine sites were lost. About a third of all marine megafauna\neventually went extinct, so fewer prey species were available. And megalodons already faced high\nenergetic demands because of their size and the mechanism they likely used\nto regulate their body temperature, which allowed them \nto navigate cold waters and attack prey with bursts of speed. Environmental changes may have\nmade megalodons vulnerable and increasingly put them in competition\nwith other predators, including the great white shark,\na relative newcomer. Because megalodons were highly\nmobile predators, their extinction had global consequences. The end of their long-distance travels\nprobably disrupted nutrient transport between different ecosystems. And many animals were suddenly released from the immense predatory pressure\nof their bite. Interestingly, some marine mammals\ndramatically increased in size afterwards, which was perhaps partially afforded because they were no longer dealing\nwith such a mega-existential threat. Knowing that the decline of apex predators\ncan destabilize entire ecosystems, conservationists are working to prevent\ntoday’s sharks from facing a similar fate— this time, because of humans. And meanwhile, the megalodon remains\na colossal testament to ecological interdependence and millions of years of bones well-bitten\nand waters well-wandered."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Based on tooth measurements and comparisons with great white sharks, what are the largest size estimates scientists have made for megalodon?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15 meters"}, {"label": "B", "text": "18 meters"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20 meters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "30 meters"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The loss of Pliocene coastal habitats resulted in up to ____ of marine megafauna going extinct, including megalodon.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1/3"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3/4"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2/5"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1/2"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Because megalodon cartilaginous skeletons do not fossilize well, its only known remains are isolated ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Teeth and dorsal fins"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Teeth and livers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Teeth and stomachs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Teeth and vertebrae"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Fossil bite marks suggest that ____ were a key aspect of megalodon’s diet.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Krill"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Whales"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fishes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Other sharks"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A 3D model of a ~16m megalodon calculated that the giant shark had how large a stomach?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10,000 liters"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50,000 liters"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100,000 liters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "200,000 liters"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

On an island in present-day Indonesia, Mount Tambora erupts with a boom that can\nbe heard over 2,000 kilometers away. Sulfurous plumes of steam and ash billow\nthousands of meters into the sky, forming dark storm clouds\nof soot and lightning. This eruption will go down as the\nlargest in recorded history, but, at this point, \nits impact is only just beginning. Ascending high into the atmosphere, Tambora’s emissions spread\nacross the globe, blotting out the sun \nfor almost an entire year. The hazy skies and cold weather of 1816\nwreak havoc on agriculture, leading to famines all across\nthe Northern Hemisphere. Nations struggle with epidemics, and artists craft bleak tributes \nto these seemingly apocalyptic times. This was the year without summer— literally one of the darkest periods\nin human history. So why are some modern researchers\nlooking for ways to repeat it? Obviously, no one wants to replicate\nthis period’s famine and despair. But some scientists are interested in\nusing sulfurous haze to block out the sun, and hopefully,\nslow the effects of global warming. This is one of many proposals\nin the realm of geoengineering— a class of deliberate, large-scale\ninterventions in Earth’s natural systems intended to help restrain climate change. Different geoengineering schemes\nintervene in different systems. Any plans to cool the planet by blocking\nthe amount of sunlight reaching the earth would fall in the category \nof solar radiation management. Some of these proposals\nare massive in scale, such as suggestions to create\na helpful version of volcanic plumes or build a giant sunshade\nin Earth’s orbit. Others are more limited, focusing \non enhancing natural cooling systems. For example, researchers might\nenlarge marine clouds or make Earth reflect more sunlight \nby building huge swaths of white surfaces. Many of these plans sound more\nthan a little strange. But there’s reason to believe\nthey might work, not least because of natural events\nlike the eruption of Tambora. Scientists know that volcanic eruptions\nhave periodically cooled the climate. Both the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 and 1883′s blast of Krakatoa reduced\nglobal average temperatures by at least half-a-degree Celsius\nfor up to a year. These cooling effects are\nglobal and fast acting— but they're also incredibly risky. The Earth is a chaotic system \nwhere even the smallest changes can create countless\nunpredictable ripple effects. We know that cooling temperatures\nimpacts precipitation, extreme weather, \nand other climate phenomena, but it’s difficult for even the most\nadvanced computer models to predict how or where \nthese consequences will occur. One country’s solar radiation management might be another country’s \nunnatural disaster, causing extreme weather or crop failures \nlike those following Tambora’s eruption. And even if these schemes did\nsafely cool the planet, solar radiation management\ndoesn’t address the greenhouse gases that are causing global warming. These solutions are just highly\nexperimental band-aids that the world would have to endure \nfor at least a few decades while we work on actually removing \nCO2 from the air. And if we pulled that band-aid\noff prematurely, global temperatures could rapidly rebound, causing a period of intense super warming. For these reasons and more \nsolar radiation management is risky. Today, researchers are running\nsmall-scale experiments, such as enhancing marine clouds \nto protect the Great Barrier Reef from further heating and bleaching. And most scientists agree that we should\npursue ways to cut emissions and remove atmospheric CO2 \nfirst and foremost. However, there are reasons to keep\nstudying these more aggressive approaches. Desperate times call for desperate\nmeasures, and in the future, geoengineering might be \ncivilization’s last resort. Furthermore, some of these plans would\nbe shockingly easy to execute by some rogue actor with enough cash. So we’ll want to be prepared \nif someone starts geoengineering without governmental approval. But perhaps the most important reason to\ninvestigate the impacts of geoengineering is that people are already making large\nscale interventions in the atmosphere. In many ways, climate change\nis an unintended geoengineering project fueled by the emissions generated from centuries \nof burning fossil fuels. And unless we take action \nto curb emissions and draw CO2 out of the atmosphere soon, summer may never be the same again."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When did Mount Tamora erupt?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "April 10th, 1615"}, {"label": "B", "text": "April 10th, 1715"}, {"label": "C", "text": "April 10th, 1815"}, {"label": "D", "text": "April 10th, 1915"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is geoengineering?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When scientists build a model of the earth to predict future climate events"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Deliberate, large-scale interventions in Earth’s natural systems intended to help restrain climate change"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A discipline that studies the effects of climate change on earth’s natural systems"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A set of methods to extract resources below the earth’s surface"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What’s an example of geoengineering?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spraying aerosols in the atmosphere that block sunlight"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Building a giant sunshade and placing it in Earth’s orbit"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Enlarge marine clouds"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Building huge swaths of white, reflective surfaces "}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above."}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Both the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 and 1883’s blast of Krakatoa reduced global average temperatures by ____ degrees celsius", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "0.5"}, {"label": "B", "text": "0.7"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1.0"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1.2"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "According to the video, what could happen if humans geoengineered an intervention to climate change and then removed it too soon?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Global temperature would rapidly decrease, risking an unnatural ice age"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Global temperatures would rapidly increase, a phenomenon known as super warming"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Someone with enough money could just replace it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nothing would happen"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
