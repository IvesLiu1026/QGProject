No one can agree. She's the mysterious subject\nof Dutch master Johannes Vermeer's \"Girl with the Pearl Earring,\" a painting often referred to\nas the 'Mona Lisa of the North.' Belonging to a Dutch style of idealized, \nsometimes overly expressive paintings known as tronies, the \"Girl with the Pearl Earring\"\nhas the allure and subtlety characteristic \nof Vermeer's work. But this painting stands apart from\nthe quiet narrative scenes that we observe from afar in many\nof Vermeer's paintings. A girl reading a letter. A piano lesson. A portrait artist at work. These paintings give us a sense of\nintimacy while retaining their distance, a drawn curtain often emphasizes\nthe separation. We can witness a milkmaid\nserenely pouring a bowl of milk, but that milk isn't for us. We're only onlookers. The studied composition\nin Vermeer's paintings invokes a balanced harmony. With the checkered floor in many\nof his works, Vermeer demonstrates his command\nof perspective and foreshortening. That's a technique that uses distortion to give the illusion\nof an object receding into the distance. Other elements, like sight lines,\nmirrors, and light sources describe the moment through space\nand position. The woman reading \na letter by an open window is precisely placed so the window\ncan reflect her image back to the viewer. Vermeer would even hide the leg\nof an easel for the sake of composition. The absence of these very elements brings\nthe \"Girl with the Pearl Earring\" to life. Vermeer's treatment of light and shadow,\nor chiaroscuro, uses a dark, flat background to further\nspotlight her three-dimensionality. Instead of being like a set piece\nin a theatrical narrative scene, she becomes a psychological subject. Her eye contact and slightly parted lips,\nas if she is about to say something, draw us into her gaze. Traditional subjects of portraiture\nwere often nobility or religious figures. So why was Vermeer painting \nan anonymous girl? In the 17th century, the city of Delft,\nlike the Netherlands in general, had turned against ruling aristocracy\nand the Catholic church. After eight decades of rebellion\nagainst Spanish power, the Dutch came to favor the idea\nof self-rule and a political republic. Cities like Delft were unsupervised\nby kings or bishops, so many artists like Vermeer\nwere left without traditional patrons. Fortunately, business innovation spearheaded by \nthe Dutch East India Company transformed the economic landscape\nin the Netherlands. It created a merchant class\nand new type of patron. Wishing to be represented\nin the paintings they financed, these merchants preferred \nmiddle class subjects depicted in spaces that looked\nlike their own homes surrounded by familiar objects. The maps that appear in Vermeer's\npaintings, for example, were considered fashionable and worldly by the merchant class of what is known\nas the Dutch Golden Age. The oriental turban worn by the \"Girl\nwith the Pearl Earring\" also emphasizes the worldliness\nof the merchant class, and the pearl itself, a symbol of wealth,\nis actually an exaggeration. Vermeer couldn't have afforded\na real pearl of its size. It was likely just a glass or tin drop\nvarnished to look like a pearl. This mirage of wealth is mirrored\nin the painting itself. In greater context, the pearl appears\nround and heavy, but a detailed view shows that it's\njust a floating smudge of paint. Upon close inspection, we are reminded\nof Vermeer's power as an illusion maker. While we may never know the real identity\nof the \"Girl with the Pearl Earring,\" we can engage with her portrait\nin a way that is unforgettable. As she hangs in her permanent home\nin the Mauritshuis Museum in The Hague, her presence is simultaneously penetrating\nand subtle. In her enigmatic way, she represents\nthe birth of a modern perspective on economics, politics, and love."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is a tronie?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An English style of portrait"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A portrait set on a black background"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An overly expressive painting"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A portrait with movement"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How does the \"Girl with the Pearl Earring\" differ from much of Vermeer’s other work?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He painted mostly scenes of every day life, not portraits"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He painted mostly men, not women"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He painted mostly scenes of nature, not people"}, {"label": "D", "text": "He painted mostly fruit bowls, not portraits"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What answer best describes Vermeer’s typical composition?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Busy and cluttered"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Harmonious and balanced"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Confusing and off-putting"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Intimidating and isolating"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What does chiaroscuro refer to?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The way characters are arranged on a canvas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The way an artist invites the reader into a painting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The way objects far away appear smaller"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The way an artist uses light and shadow"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What economic innovation helped replace traditional patrons in Vermeer’s home town?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Socialism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nobility and the Church"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Dutch East India Company"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Industialization"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 36, "lesson": 2, "title": "The Most Radioactive Places on Earth", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/HQg9hUhC", "transcript": {"en": "radiation is frightening at least certain types of it are I mean my Geiger counter doesn't go off near my mobile phone or the Wi-Fi router or my microwave that's because a Geiger counter only measures ionizing radiation that is radiation with enough energy to rip electrons off atoms and it's measured in units called sieverts if you're exposed to more than two sieverts all at once you'll probably die shortly after that but we're exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation all the time bananas for example are rich in potassium and some of that potassium is naturally radioactive so when you eat a banana you're actually exposed to about 0.1 micro sieverts of radiation that's one ten-millionth of a sievert let's use a banana for scale of radiation doses you know since people eat bananas we become radioactive too so you're actually exposed to more radiation if you sleep next to someone than if you sleep alone but I wouldn't worry about that because that dose is insignificant compared to the natural background radiation of Earth I mean there's ionizing radiation coming out of the soil and the rocks and the air and even from space the level of radiation here in Sydney is about 0.15 microsieverts per hour and that's about average globally the levels usually between point 1 and point 2 microsieverts per hour but there are places with significantly higher levels so who on earth you think receives the maximum dose of ionizing radiation let's answer that question by going to the most radioactive places on earth some places you'd expect to have high levels of radiation might surprise you I'm in her rush MA and that is the peace dome it was about 600 meters above that dome where the world's first nuclear bomb was detonated over a city it was detonated there to have maximum destructive impact with a level of radiation today almost 70 years later is only 0.3 microsieverts per hour this is the mine where uranium was discovered it's also the place where Marie Curie obtained her raw material 2007 microsiemens per hour it's about ten times the natural background that you would have nowadays most of the uranium has been removed but in this wall there's still a small piece and you can see under UV light it flores's look at that florescent uranium ore this is the lab of Marie Curie she won two Nobel prizes one in physics and one in chemistry and she conducted a lot of her work here and this is her office she would have said right there apparently there are only a few parts of this area which are still radioactive one is this doorknob what it climbs looked a lot much bit but that's like 10 times the background yes more that's it and another is the back of her chair you can still detect alpha particles coming off this spot right here apparently after she was worth being a lab she would come open the door leaving traces of radium here and then go and pull out her chair welcome to New Mexico this is the Trinity bomb test site where the world's first nuclear bomb was set off right here right in this spot this whole area was vaporized in fact there was so much heat liberated by that bomb that it fused all of the desert sand into this green glass and you can still find it here they've actually named this mineral after the test it's called Trinitite yeah this is the only place on earth that this has ever been made the level of radiation here is about 0.8 microsieverts an hour the Trinitite itself is a little bit more radioactive i've got readings of two or three microsieverts an hour off them now which place has higher levels of radiation than anywhere we've seen so far the answer is an airplane you know as you gain altitude there's less atmosphere above you to shield you from cosmic rays so the level of radiation inside the plane can go up to 0.5 microsieverts per hour at 18,000 feet up to one micro sievert per hour at 23,000 feet over two microsieverts per hour at 33,000 feet and over three microsieverts per hour at even higher altitudes and towards the poles that is two noble nuclear reactor number four it melted down on April 26 1986 so what happened was so much heat was generated inside that reactor that it basically blew the top off spreading radioactive isotopes throughout this whole surrounding area and over into Europe and that is why we can still detect the contamination here today now right now it's reading around five microsieverts an hour if I stayed here for one hour my body would receive a similar dose to what you'd receive when you get a dental x-ray so this is not a huge amount of radiation and one of the reasons why the radiation level is not too high is because they actually removed a couple meters worth of topsoil from this whole area then they dumped it somewhere that's why we can stand here we're driving into the Fukushima exclusion zone now I'm just watching as the levels on my Geiger counter go up as we approach the zone see those black bags at the side of the road the Japanese are doing now exactly what the people in Chernobyl did collecting up meters and meters of topsoil the mask is probably overkill it's just to stop radioactive dust from getting into my lungs this is definitely one of the most radioactive places where I've been even though the release of radioactive material was less than true noble only about 10% because it's much fresher only three years since the accident much less if it has decayed so I've been getting readings up around five to ten microsieverts an hour and I think we won't be staying here too long because of that I'm about to go into the hospital at Pripyat and this is where the firemen were taken after they fought the fires at the Chernobyl reactor and in the basement of this building they have left all of the firemen's clothing once they realized it was so contaminated they chucked it down there but you can see there's a huge pile how about Judah read upside the bear I'm getting half hundred Mike receive it's another bill that basement was the most radioactive place I visited and it's one of the most radioactive places on earth if I'd stay down there for one hour I would have received 2,000 micro sieverts that's a year's worth of natural background radiation every yellow pixel here represents a banana now that might seem like a lot but consider that in a CT scan the patient receives about 7,000 micro sieverts that's three years worth of natural background radiation it's been estimated that the people living around Fukushima will receive an additional 10,000 micro sieverts over their lifetime due to the nuclear power disaster for comparison us radiation workers are limited to a maximum of 50,000 microsieverts per year but that's less than another occupation astronaut an astronaut on the space station for six months will receive about 80,000 micro sieverts worth of radiation but not even they are exposed to the highest levels of ionizing radiation so can you guess who is the answer is a smokers lungs a smokers lungs on average receive 160,000 microsieverts worth of radiation every year that's due to the radioactive polonium and radioactive lead in the tobacco that they're smoking so not only are they exposed to carcinogens and toxins they also receive very high levels of radiation so it's not the people of Fukushima or Chernobyl or radiation workers or even astronauts who receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation that honor goes to your ordinary average smoker hey as you can see over the last few months I've been traveling around the world actually filming a documentary for television it should be on in the middle of next year but being in places like Chernobyl and Fukushima reminded me of this book the day of the Triffids it's about a post-apocalyptic world in which plants take over I know it sounds like a crazy idea but it's actually a brilliant book so you should really check it out if you're looking for something to do over the holidays now you can download

people vote in elections according to the categories of right wing and left wing but there might be another way of labeling an electorate that taps into something broader and deeper in human personality we might apportion people into the camps of romantic and classical voters which one might you be part of here is some of what separates these two fundamental electoral types romantic believes that a far better world could be just around the corner if only bold and swift action could be taken if we entered an agreement or scrapped an agreement started a war or ended a war the romantic considers a degree of impatience to be a vital resource in governing a nation they may not think too badly of a bit of anger either so long as it's handled correctly you can be too forgiving after all the romantic is excited by how things might ideally be and always judges what currently exists in the world by the standard of a better imagined alternative most of the time the current state of things arouses them to intense disappointment as they consider the injustice a--'s prevarications compromises and timidity of almost everyone in government for their part the classical voter is highly distrustful of sudden gestures and actions they pay special attention to what can go wrong they're very concerned to mitigate the downside they're aware that most things could be a lot worse before condemning a policy they consider the standard of policy across history and may regard a current arrangement as bearable under the circumstances their view of people is fundamentally rather dark they believe that everyone is probably slightly worse than they seem they feel humans have deeply dangerous impulses lusts and drives and believe that the task of politics is to try and contain them rather than liberate genius strength beauty or benevolence high ideals make them nervous they are led by a desire not to make anything worse insofar as they hope for improvement it's in a cautious modest way they dare to suppose that the world may be a marginally better place in about 300 years time romantics see a lot that's wrong with the world and feel confident about analyzing who might be to blame for it perhaps this particular social group or that class a problem can't just be no one's fault and therefore the task of politics is to identify the wrongdoers and respond appropriately romantics feel a basic trust in their own capacity for purity they are sure they would be unable to be as shabby as their enemies whom they can therefore attack with a relatively clean conscience classical voters also notice what's wrong but they're highly aware of their own capacity for sinfulness and error which makes them hesitant about apportioning blame they recognize how easily they might have been active wrongdoers if circumstances have been different and suppose that no one has a monopoly on righteousness they would suggest that evil is pretty proportionately distributed across all groups and classes and that a priority is therefore for us to tolerantly cut each other slack at every turn romantic voters believe that everything great in history is the result of talented individuals taking destiny into their hands and struggling against the inertia and conservatism of the mass and most importantly of institutions classical voters are deeply worried by the possibility of lone actors taking matters into their hands and through natural weaknesses which all of us even the most intelligent are afflicted by creating disaster they are therefore on the side of legally grounded extremely slow-moving institutions that are designed to restrain individual power and contain the capacity of any one person to shift the direction of the group to quickly romantic voters believe it's possible to understand a situational issue so clearly one can be sure of complete justice and rightness vertol those who don't agree don't have to be listened to politely they are evidently wrong and can be silenced or sidelined as required classical voters are extremely alert to the possibility of error in their own and others analyses of policy but they are therefore committed to hearing and tolerating dissenting views in which they suspect a portion of the truth may always be lodged [Music] romantic voters feel that the best way for a nation to be safe in the world is for it to seem prominently strong classical voters feel that the best way to be safe in the world is to be thought well of and will therefore avoid actions that could upset alarm or confuse neighbors they're aware of how easily strength arouses the desire of others to be equally strong back they suspect the best way to proceed might be to train and private for the worst but extend a hand of friendship at every public turn both romantic and classical political orientations have important truths to impart neither is wholly right or wrong they need to be balanced and none of us are in any case ever simply one or the other but because a good political landscape requires a judicious balance of throath temperaments at this point in history in many countries it might be the classical electoral attitude whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need to listen to most intently and which is most ripe for rediscovery you"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Between the two electoral

{"page": 36, "lesson": 4, "title": "Teach girls bravery, not perfection", "category": "Teaching & Education", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/16DCJILa", "transcript": {"en": "So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed\nsafely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman\nhad been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her\nin a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,\ntold a very different story. My pollsters told me\nthat I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart\nin a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement\nfrom the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal\nsnapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest\nraces in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy\nan Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers\nthat said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk\nabout the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story\nof how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time\nin my entire life that I had done something\nthat was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate\ntowards careers and professions that they know\nthey're going to be great in, that they know they're\ngoing to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught\nto avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars\nand then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise\nor even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated\nto take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously\nunless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry\nabout our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society,\nwe're just losing out because we're not raising\nour girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why\nwomen are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders\nhandled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls\nwere quick to give up. The higher the IQ,\nthe more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material\nto be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely\nto redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys\nin every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys\nand girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found\nthat men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent\nof the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent\nof the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked\nas evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized\nto aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take\nless risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs\nthat are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy\nis being left behind on all the innovation and problems\nwomen would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company\nto teach girls to code, and what I found\nis that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process\nof trial and error, of trying to get the right command\nin the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference\nbetween success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying\nto build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher\ntells me the same story. During the first week,\nwhen the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over\nand she'll say, \"I don't know what code to write.\" The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,\nshe'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes\njust staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student\nwrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing\nthe progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls\nare really good at coding, but it's not enough\njust to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor\nat the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours\nwith computer science students. When the guys are struggling\nwith an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, \"Professor, there's something\nwrong with my code.\" The girls will come in and say, \"Professor, there's something\nwrong with me.\" We have to begin to undo\nthe socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it\nwith building a sisterhood that lets girls know\nthat they are not alone. Because trying harder\nis not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, \"I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network\ncheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance,\ntwo of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love\nfor her new country by building an app\nto help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl\nwho built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer\nis benign or malignant in the off chance\nthat she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just\nthree examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been\nsocialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying,\nwho have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been\nmore important for our country. For the American economy,\nfor any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind\nhalf our population. We have to socialize our girls\nto be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them\nto learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them\nto be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential\nto impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them\nthat they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you\nto tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece,\nyour employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach\ngirls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement\nof young women who are brave and who will build\na better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have.\nYou have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls\nare involved now in your program? Reshma Saujani: Yeah.\nSo in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000\nin all 50 states. (Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated\n7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make\nthat type of change quickly. CA: And you're working with some\nof the companies in this room even, who are welcoming\ngraduates from your program? RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft\nto Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up,\nI'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code\nclassroom in their office. CA: And you have some stories\nback from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams,\ngood things happen. RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me\nto think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all\nconsumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate\nof 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building\nthe companies of tomorrow.

What happens to all \nof those people's bodies after they die and will the planet eventually\nrun out of burial space? When a person's heart stops beating, the body passes through several\nstages before it begins decomposing. Within minutes after death, the blood begins settling in\nthe lower-most parts of the body. Usually eight to twelve hours later, the skin in those areas is discolored\nby livor mortis, or post-mortem stain. And while at the moment of death\nthe body's muscles relax completely in a condition called primary flaccidity, they stiffen about two to six hours later\nin what's known as rigor mortis. This stiffening spreads \nthrough the muscles, and its speed can be affected by age,\ngender, and the surrounding environment. The body also changes temperature, usually cooling off \nto match its environment. Next comes decomposition, the process by which bacteria and insects\nbreak apart the body. Many factors affect \nthe rate of decomposition. There is, however, a basic guide of the\neffect of the environment on decompositon called Casper's Law. It says that if all other \nfactors are equal, a body exposed to air decomposes twice\nas fast as one immersed in water and eight times as fast \nas one buried in earth. Soil acidity also greatly \naffects bone preservation. High-acidity soils with \na pH of less than 5.3 will rapidly decompose bone, whereas in a neutral or basic soil\nwith a pH of 7 or more, a skeleton can remain in relatively\ngood condition for centuries. Different cultures throughout history have\ndeveloped unique approaches to burials. As far back as \nthe first Neanderthal burials, death was accompanied by rituals, like the positioning, coloring,\nor decorating of corpses. Traditional Christian burials decorate\nthe body in dress, while in traditional Islam, a body is wrapped in a piece \nof ritual fabric with the face oriented toward Mecca. Traditional Hindus ceremonially burn\nthe body, and Zoroastrians, followers of one of the\noldest monotheistic religions, traditionally place bodies atop a tower\nto expose them to the Sun and scavenging birds.` Before the Industrial Revolution,\nburials were simple and accessible. These days, with suitable burial land\nrunning out in high-population areas, purchasing private gravesites\ncan be costly, and many people can't afford\nsimple burials. Even cremation, the second most common\nburial practice in the world, comes with a high cost. As for the question \nof running out of space, the issue isn't so much about total land\nin the world as it is that large populations cluster\ntogether within cities. Most of the big cities in the world may run out of suitable burial grounds\nwithin a century. For London, it's even sooner. That may happen by 2035. So are there alternatives\nto traditional burials that might help with the space issue? In some countries, skyscraper cemeteries\nenable vertical burials. Some options focus on the body's\nrelationship with the environment. Promession, for example, freeze-dries\nand pulverizes the body, creating a powder \nthat can turn into compost when mixed with oxygen and water. There are also green burials that use\nspecial materials, such as biodegradable caskets, urns that sprout trees, and burial suits that grow mushrooms. Eternal reefs take that concept\nto the depths of the ocean using a mixture of ashes and cement\nto create marine habitats for sea life. Death is an inevitable part\nof the human condition, but how we treat bodies and burials\ncontinues to evolve. We may each have different spiritual, religious, or practical approaches to dying, but the ever-increasing demand\nfor burial space might give us a push to be creative about where our bodies go\nafter the final stages of life."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The number of people who have died increase to what percent of the world’s population every year?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10"}, {"label": "B", "text": "15"}, {"label": "C", "text": ".8"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Post mortem stain is called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Algor mortis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Livor mortis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rigor mortis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Primary flaccidity"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Based on the Casper's Law, a body decomposes in_____8 times as fast as in____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Water; air"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Air; water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Air; soil"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Soil; water"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the second most common burial method?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Soil internment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Burying in biodegradable caskets"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cremation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Promession"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When was the first burial observed in the human history timeline?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Neanderthals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Homo Sapiens"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Homo Erectus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Homo Habilis"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Finally, it's all you can think about, and out of sheer desperation, you go on a hunt for a bathroom\nuntil \"ahh.\" Humans should urinate at least\nfour to six times a day, but occasionally, the pressures of modern\nlife forces us to clench and hold it in. How bad is this habit,\nand how long can our bodies withstand it? The answers lie in the workings\nof the bladder, an oval pouch \nthat sits inside the pelvis. Surrounding this structure \nare several other organs that together make up the whole\nurinary system. Two kidneys, two ureters, two urethral sphincters, and a urethra. Constantly trickling down from the kidneys\nis the yellowish liquid known as urine. The kidneys make urine from a mix\nof water and the body's waste products, funneling the unwanted fluid\ninto two muscular tubes called ureters. These carry it downward into\nthe hollow organ known as the bladder. This organ's muscular wall is made of\ntissue called detrusor muscle which relaxes as the bladder fills\nallowing it to inflate like a balloon. As the bladder gets full, \nthe detrusor contracts. The internal urethral sphincter\nautomatically and involuntarily opens, and the urine is released. Whooshing downwards, \nthe fluid enters the urethra and stops short at the external\nurethral sphincter. This works like a tap. When you want to delay urinating,\nyou keep the sphincter closed. When you want to release it,\nyou can voluntarily open the flood gates. But how do you sense \nyour bladder's fullness so you know when to pee? Inside the layers of detrusor muscles\nare millions of stretch receptors that get triggered as the bladder fills. They send signals along your nerves\nto the sacral region in your spinal cord. A reflex signal travels back to\nyour bladder, making the detrusor muscle \ncontract slightly and increasing the bladder's pressure\nso you're aware that it's filling up. Simultaneously, the internal \nurethral sphincter opens. This is called the micturition reflex. The brain can counter it if it's not\na good time to urinate by sending another signal to contract\nthe external urethral sphincter. With about 150 to 200 milliliters of urine\ninside of it, the bladder's muscular wall \nis stretched enough for you to sense \nthat there's urine within. At about 400 to 500 milliliters,\nthe pressure becomes uncomfortable. The bladder can go on stretching,\nbut only to a point. Above 1,000 milliliters, it may burst. Most people would lose bladder\ncontrol before this happens, but in very rare cases, such as when as a person can't sense\nthe need to urinate, the pouch can rupture painfully\nrequiring surgery to fix. But under normal circumstances, your decision to urinate stops the brain's\nsignal to the external urethral sphincter, causing it to relax \nand the bladder to empty. The external urethral sphincter\nis one of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and it provides support to the urethra\nand bladder neck. It's lucky we have these \npelvic floor muscles because placing pressure on the system\nby coughing, sneezing, laughing, or jumping could cause bladder leakage. Instead, the pelvic floor muscles\nkeep the region sealed until you're ready to go. But holding it in for too long, forcing out your urine too fast, or urinating without proper\nphysical support may over time weaken or overwork\nthat muscular sling. That can lead to an overactive\npelvic floor, bladder pain, urgency, or urinary incontinence. So in the interest of long-term health, it's not a great habit to hold your pee. But in the short term, at least,\nyour body and brain have got you covered, so you can conveniently choose\nyour moment of sweet release."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The kidneys create a fluid called urine which is made up of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Digestive enzymes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sugars and salts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Water and waste products"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Water and enzymes"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The bladder wall is made up of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ligament"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Muscle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Skin"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In the micturition reflex, as the bladder fills, a reflex nerve signal from the spinal cord to the bladder causes:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The detrusor to relax and the internal urethral sphincter to close"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The detrusor to relax and the internal urethral sphincter to open"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The detrusor to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to close"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The detrusor to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to open"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which part of the urinary system is also part of the pelvic floor muscles?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ureters"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Internal urethral sphincter"}, {"label": "C", "text": "External urethral sphincter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Detrusor"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The bladder wall is stretched enough for you to sense that there’s urine within at:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "0-50mls"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50-100mls"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100-150mls"}, {"label": "D", "text": "150-200mls"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

They were all awarded \nthe Nobel Peace Prize. Among the top prestigious awards\nin the world, this prize has honored \nsome of the most celebrated and revered international figures\nand organizations in history. To understand how it all got started,\nwe have to go back to the 1800s. Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel was then mostly known \nfor the invention of dynamite, a breakthrough which launched his career\nas a successful inventor and businessman. 30 years later, he had become\nextremely wealthy, but never married, and had no children. When his will was opened after his death, it came as a surprise that his fortune\nwas to be used for five prizes in physics, chemistry, \nmedicine, literature, and peace. These prizes illustrated his lifelong\ncommitment to sciences and his passion for literature. But what about peace? Because Nobel's name was tied\nto inventions used in the war industry, many have assumed that he created \nthe peace prize out of regret. However, this is all speculation\nas he never expressed any such sentiments, and his inventions were also used\nfor constructive purposes. Instead, many historians connect Alfred\nNobel's interest for the peace cause to his decade-long friendship \nand correspondence with an Austrian pacifist \nnamed Bertha Von Suttner. Von Suttner was one of the leaders\nof the international peace movement, and in 1905, after Nobel's death, she became the first woman\nto be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Nobel's will outlined three criteria\nfor the Peace Prize, which unlike the other \nSweden-based prizes, would be administered in Norway. Disarmament, peace congresses,\nand brotherhood between nations. These standards have since been expanded to include \nother ways of promoting peace, such as human rights and negotiations. And the prize doesn't just have to go\nto one person. About a third of Noble Peace Prizes\nhave been shared by two or three laureates. So how do nominations for the prize work? According to the Nobel Foundation, a valid nomination can come from\na member of a national assembly, state government, or an international court. Eligible nominators also include\nuniversity rectors, professors of the social sciences, \nhistory, philosophy, law, and theology, and previous recipients \nof the Peace Prize. But if you want to know more about\nwho was recently nominated, you'll have to be patient. All information about nominations\nremains secret for 50 years. Take Martin Luther King Jr. We didn't actually know who nominated him\nuntil 2014. His nominators turned out \nto be the Quakers, who had won the prize previously, and eight members \nof the Swedish Parliament. There's no limit to the number of times\na person or organization can be nominated. In fact, Jane Addams, recognized as the founder \nof social work in the United States, was nominated 91 times before\nfinally being awarded the prize. The absence of a laureate can also\nbe symbolic. The 1948 decision not to award the prize\nfollowing the death of Mahatma Gandhi has been interpreted as an attempt\nto respectfully honor the so-called missing laureate. As with the other Nobel Prizes, the Peace Prize can't be \nawarded posthumously. The secret selection process \ntakes almost a year, and is carried out by \nthe five appointed members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee who are forbidden from having\nany official political function in Norway. Starting with a large pool of nominations, exceeding 300 in recent years, they access each candidate's work\nand create a short list. Finally, the chairman \nof the Nobel Committee publicly announces \nthe laureate in October. The awards ceremony takes place\non December 10th, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. The prize itself includes a gold medal inscribed with the Latin words,\n\"Pro pace et fraternitate gentium,\" or \"For the peace and brotherhood of men,\" as well as a diploma \nand a large cash prize. Recently, it's been \n8 million Swedish kronor, or roughly a million US dollars, which is split in the case \nof multiple laureates. And while laureates can use the prize\nmoney as they choose, in recent years, many have donated it\nto humanitarian or social causes. For many years, the Nobel Peace Prize\nwas predominately awarded to European and North American men. But in recent years, significant changes\nhave been taking place, making the prize more global than ever. 23 organizations and 103 individuals, that's 87 men and 16 women, have made up the 126 Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureates in history. They include Desmond Tutu for his\nnonviolent campaign against apartheid in South Africa, Jody Williams for her campaign to ban\nand clear anti-personnel mines, Rigoberta Menchú Tum for her work\nfor social justice and reconciliation based on respect for the rights\nof indigenous peoples, Martti Ahtisaari for his efforts\nto resolve international conflicts in Namibia, Kosovo, and Indonesia, and Aung San Suu Kyi for her nonviolent\nstruggle for democracy and human rights in Myanmar. They're just a few examples of the people\nwho have inspired us, challenged us, and demonstrated through their actions that there are many paths to peace."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When does the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony take place?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "June 7th"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The second Friday in October"}, {"label": "C", "text": "December 10th"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It changes from one year to another"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Where is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Washington D.C, U.S.A"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Oslo, Norway"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stockholm, Sweden"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Paris, France"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who is responsible for the selection process?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Alfred Nobel’s family"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Norwegian Parliament"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Norwegian Nobel Committee"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Nobel Foundation"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who didn’t receive the Nobel Peace Prize?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mahatma Gandhi"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nelson Mandela"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Martin Luther King"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mother Teresa"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How long are nominations kept secret?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "25 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "50 years"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Microgravity impairs muscle\nand bone growth, and high doses of radiation\ncause irreversible mutations. As we seriously consider the human\nspecies becoming space-faring, a big question stands. Even if we break free \nfrom Earth's orbit and embark on long-duration\njourneys among the stars, can we adapt to the extreme\nenvironments of space? This won't be the first time that humans\nhave adapted to harsh environments and evolved superhuman capabilities. Not fantastical powers like laser vision\nor invisibility, but physiological adaptations\nfor survival in tough conditions. For example, on the Himalayan mountains where the highest elevation \nis nine kilometers above sea level, an unacclimated lowland human\nwill experience symptoms of hypoxia, commonly known as mountain sickness. At these altitudes, the body usually\nproduces extra red blood cells, thickening the blood \nand impeding its flow. But Himalayans who have lived on\nthese mountains for thousands of years permanently evolved mechanisms\nto circumvent this process and maintain normal blood flow. Cases like that prove that humans\ncan develop permanent lifesaving traits. But natural adaptation \nfor entire human populations could take tens of thousands of years. Recent scientific advances may help us\naccelerate human adaptation to single generations. To thrive as a species \nduring space travel, we could potentially develop methods to quickly program protective abilities\ninto ourselves. A beta version of these methods\nis gene therapy, which we can currently use to correct\ngenetic diseases. Gene editing technology,\nwhich is improving rapidly, allows scientists to directly change\nthe human genome to stop undesirable processes\nor make helpful substances. An example of an unwanted process is what happens when our bodies\nare exposed to ionizing radiation. Without an atmospheric barrier\nand a magnetic field like Earth's, most planets and moons are bombarded\nwith these dangerous subatomic particles. They can pass through nearly anything and would cause potentially cancerous\nDNA damage to space explorers. But what if we could turn the tables\non radiation? Human skin produces a pigment\ncalled melanin that protects us from the filtered\nradiation on Earth. Melanin exists in many forms\nacross species, and some melanin-expressing fungi use the pigment to convert radiation\ninto chemical energy. Instead of trying to shield \nthe human body, or rapidly repair damage, we could potentially engineer humans to adopt and express these fungal,\nmelanin-based energy-harvesting systems. They'd then convert radiation into\nuseful energy while protecting our DNA. This sounds pretty sci-fi, but may actually be achievable \nwith current technology. But technology isn't the only obstacle. There are ongoing debates \non the consequences and ethics of such radical alterations\nto our genetic fabric. Besides radiation, variation in gravitational strength\nis another challenge for space travelers. Until we develop artificial gravity\nin a space ship or on another planet, we should assume that astronauts\nwill spend time living in microgravity. On Earth, human bone and muscle\ncustodial cells respond to the stress \nof gravity's incessant tugging by renewing old cells in processes\nknown as remodeling and regeneration. But in a microgravity environment\nlike Mars, human bone and muscle cells\nwon't get these cues, resulting in osteoporosis \nand muscle atrophy. So, how could we provide \nan artificial signal for cells to counteract bone and muscle loss? Again, this is speculative, but biochemically engineered microbes\ninside our bodies could churn out bone and muscle\nremodeling signaling factors. Or humans could be genetically engineered to produce more of these signals\nin the absence of gravity. Radiation exposure and microgravity\nare only two of the many challenges we will encounter in the hostile\nconditions of space. But if we're ethically prepared\nto use them, gene editing and microbial engineering\nare two flexible tools that could be adapted to many scenarios. In the near future, we may decide\nto further develop and tune these genetic tools\nfor the harsh realities of space living."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is a super-trait that some human populations have evolved?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Super-sonic speed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Arsenic tolerance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Invisibility"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Telepathy"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What challenges do astronauts encounter in space?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cosmic radiation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Microgravity-induced bone growth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Buyer’s remorse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Muscle atrophy"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A) and C)"}, {"label": "F", "text": "A) and D)"}, {"label": "G", "text": "B) and C)"}], "correct_option": "F"}, {"question": "Humans produce a skin pigment know as ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Melatonin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Melanin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Osteoblast"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hemoglobin"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Chitosan"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What feature of space causes changes in muscle strength in astronauts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cold temperatures"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cosmic radiation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Microgravity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Proximity to the sun"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Microcephaly"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which two biotechnological tools can be used to assist long-term space travelers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Radiation therapy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gene editing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Microbial engineering"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cardiac surgery"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A) and B)"}, {"label": "F", "text": "B) and C)"}], "correct_option": "F"}]}

They keep misplacing \ntheir instruments on tour, and it's driving their manager mad. On the day of the big concert, the band wakes up \nto find themselves tied up in a windowless, \nsoundproof practice room. Their manager explains what's happening. Outside, there are ten large boxes. Each contains one of your instruments, but don't be fooled by the pictures -\nthey've been randomly placed. I'm going to let you out one at a time. While you're outside, you can look\ninside any five boxes before security\ntakes you back to the tour bus. You can't touch the instruments or in any way communicate what you find\nto the others. No marking the boxes, shouting, nothing. If each one of you \ncan find your own instrument, then you can play tonight. Otherwise, the label is dropping you. You have three minutes to think about it\nbefore we start. The band is in despair. After all, each musician only has a 50%\nchance of finding their instrument by picking five random boxes. And the chances that all ten will succeed\nare even lower - just 1 in 1024. But suddenly, the drummer comes up\nwith a valid strategy that has a better than 35% chance\nof working. Can you figure out what it was? Pause the video on the next screen\nif you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Here's what the drummer said: Everyone first open the box\nwith the picture of your instrument. If your instrument is inside, you're done. Otherwise, look at whatever's in there, and then open the box \nwith that picture on it. Keep going that way until you find\nyour instrument. The bandmates are skeptical, but amazingly enough,\nthey all find what they need. And a few hours later, they're playing\nto thousands of adoring fans. So why did the drummer's strategy work? Each musician follows a linked sequence that starts with the box whose outside\nmatches their instrument and ends with the box \nactually containing it. Note that if they kept going,\nthat would lead them back to the start, so this is a loop. For example, if the boxes \nare arranged like so, the singer would open the first box\nto find the drums, go to the eighth box to find the bass, and find her microphone in the third box, which would point back to the first. This works much better \nthan random guessing because by starting with the box \nwith the picture of their instrument, each musician restricts their search to\nthe loop that contains their instrument, and there are decent odds, about 35%, that all of the loops \nwill be of length five or less. How do we calculate those odds? For the sake of simplicity, \nwe'll demonstrate with a simplified case, four instruments and no more than \ntwo guesses allowed for each musician. Let's start by finding \nthe odds of failure, the chance that someone will need\nto open three or four boxes before they find their instrument. There are six distinct four-box loops. One fun way to count them \nis to make a square, put an instrument at each corner, and draw the diagonals. See how many unique loops you can find, and keep in mind that these two \nare considered the same, they just start at different points. These two, however, are different. We can visualize the eight distinct\nthree-box loops using triangles. You'll find four possible triangles depending on which instrument \nyou leave out, and two distinct paths on each. So of the 24 possible \ncombinations of boxes, there are 14 that lead to faliure, and ten that result in success. That computational strategy works for any\neven number of musicians, but if you want a shortcut, it generalizes to a handy equation. Plug in ten musicians, \nand we get odds of about 35%.

{"page": 36, "lesson": 11, "title": "A simple way to break a bad habit", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/K11azGiY", "transcript": {"en": "When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply\npay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered,\nto bring it back. Sounded simple enough. Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts\nin the middle of winter. I'd take naps every chance I got\nbecause it was really hard work. Actually, it was exhausting. The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something\nreally important. So why is it so hard to pay attention? Well, studies show that even when we're really\ntrying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us\nwill drift off into a daydream, or have this urge\nto check our Twitter feed. So what's going on here? It turns out that we're fighting one\nof the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes\ncurrently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic\nnervous systems known to man. This reward-based learning process is called positive\nand negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good, our brain says, \"Calories! ... Survival!\" We eat the food, we taste it -- it tastes good. And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal\nto our brain that says, \"Remember what you're eating\nand where you found it.\" We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. See food, eat food, feel good, repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. Simple, right? Well, after a while,\nour creative brains say, \"You know what? You can use this for more\nthan just remembering where food is. You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating\nsomething good so you'll feel better?\" We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream\nwhen we're mad or sad, we feel better. Same process, just a different trigger. Instead of this hunger signal\ncoming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat. Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids\noutside smoking and we think, \"Hey, I want to be cool.\" So we start smoking. The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,\nand that was no accident. See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. So later, feeling stressed out triggers\nthat urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet. Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves\nwith these habits. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes\nof morbidity and mortality in the world. So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves\nto pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural,\nreward-based learning process ... but added a twist? What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening\nin our momentary experience? I'll give you an example. In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training\ncould help people quit smoking. Now, just like trying to force myself\nto pay attention to my breath, they could try to force\nthemselves to quit smoking. And the majority of them\nhad tried this before and failed -- on average, six times. Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing\nand instead focused on being curious. In fact, we even told them to smoke. What? Yeah, we said, \"Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious\nabout what it's like when you do.\" And what did they notice? Well here's an example\nfrom one of our smokers. She said, \"Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!\" Now, she knew, cognitively\nthat smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being\ncuriously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit. (Laughter) Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom. She moved from knowing in her head\nthat smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken. She started to become\ndisenchanted with her behavior. Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain\nfrom an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level\nthat we shouldn't smoke. And it tries its hardest\nto help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second,\nthat third, that fourth cookie. We call this cognitive control. We're using cognition\nto control our behavior. Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline\nwhen we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful. Now, we can all relate to this\nin our own experience. We're much more likely to do things\nlike yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know\nit's not going to be helpful. We just can't help ourselves. When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment\nis so important. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them\nat a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force\nourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior. We're just less interested\nin doing it in the first place. And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get\nwhen we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance,\nnaturally letting go. This isn't to say that, poof,\nmagically we quit smoking. But over time, as we learn\nto see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones. The paradox here is that mindfulness is just\nabout being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening\nin our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness\nto turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant\ncravings go away as quickly as possible. And this willingness\nto turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding. What does curiosity feel like? It feels good. And what happens when we get curious? We start to notice that cravings\nare simply made up of body sensations -- oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness -- and that these body\nsensations come and go. These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered\nby this huge, scary craving that we choke on. In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old,\nfear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting\nthat next data point. Now, this might sound\ntoo simplistic to affect behavior. But in one study,\nwe found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy\nat helping people quit smoking. So it actually works. And when we studied\nthe brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network\nof self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play. Now, one current hypothesis\nis that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily\nby craving itself but when we get caught up in it,\nwhen we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride. In contrast, when we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware\nof what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down. Now we're testing app and online-based\nmindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology\nthat's driving us to distraction to help us step out\nof our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating\nand other addictive behaviors. Now, remember that bit\nabout context-dependent memory? We can deliver these tools\nto peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity\nto be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke\nor stress eat or whatever arises. So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge\nto check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract\nyourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond\nto that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into\nthis natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body\nand mind in that moment. It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless\nand exhaustive habit loops ... or step out of it. Instead of see text message,\ncompulsively text back, feel a little bit better -- notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat. Thank you.

Could we move beyond \nour small blue planet to establish colonies in the multitude\nof star systems out there? This question's a pretty daunting one. There are around 300 billion stars\nin the galaxy, which is about 160,000 light-years across. So far we've sent a single spacecraft\noutside our solar system, trudging along at 0.006% of \nthe speed of light. At that rate, it would take over \n2.5 billion years just to get from one end of the galaxy\nto the other. And then there's the question \nof human survival. The gulf between stars is simply enormous. We couldn't live sustainably \non most planets, and we require a lot of resources\nto stay alive. And yet, decades ago, scholars found\nthat it's theoretically possible to not just spread human civilization\nacross the galaxy, but to do so quite quickly, without breaking any known \nlaws of physics. Their idea is based on the work\nof a mathematician named John von Neumann, who designed on paper machines \nthat could self-replicate and create new generations of themselves. These would later come to be known\nas von Neumann machines. In the context of space exploration, von Neumann machines could be\nbuilt on Earth and launched into space. There, the self-sufficient machines\nwould land on distant planets. They would then mine the available\nresources and harvest energy, build replicas of themselves, launch those to the nearest planets, and continue the cycle. The result is the creation \nof millions of probes spreading outwards into the universe\nlike a drop of ink in a fishbowl. Scholars crunched the numbers and found\nthat a single von Neumann machine traveling at 5% of the speed of light should be able to replicate throughout\nour galaxy in 4 million years or less. That may sound like a long time, but when you consider that our universe\nis 14 billion years old, on a cosmic scale, it's incredibly fast - the equivalent of about 2.5 hours\nin an entire year. Creating von Neumann machines\nwould require a few technologies we don't have yet, including advanced \nartificial intelligence, miniaturization, and better propulsion systems. If we wanted to use them to spread actual\nhumans throughout the galaxy, we would need \nyet another technological leap - the ability to artificially \ngrow biological organisms and bodies using raw elements \nand genetic information. Regardless, if in the last billion years an alien civilization \ncreated such a machine and set it multiplying its way toward us, our galaxy would be \nswarming with them by now. So then where are all these machines? Some astronomers, like Carl Sagan, say that intelligent aliens wouldn't\nbuild self-replicating machines at all. They might hurtle out of control, scavenging planets to their cores\nin order to keep replicating. Others take the machines absence as proof that intelligent alien civilizations \ndon't exist, or that they go extinct before they can\ndevelop the necessary technologies. But all this hasn't stopped people from\nimagining what it would be like if they were out there. Science fiction author David Brin writes about a universe in which\nmany different von Neumann machines exist and proliferate simultaneously. Some are designed \nto greet young civilizations, others to locate and destroy them\nbefore they become a threat. In fact, in Brin's story \"Lungfish,\" some von Neumann machines are keeping\na close watch over the Earth right now, waiting for us to reach a certain level\nof sophistication before they make their move. For now, all we have is curiosity \nand theory. But the next time \nyou look at the night sky, consider that billions of\nself-replicating machines could be advancing between stars\nin our galaxy right now. If they exist, one of them will eventually\nland on Earth, or maybe, just maybe,\nthey're already here."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Alien Von-Neumann Machines:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Are keeping close watch over the Earth."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Have not yet been discovered."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prowl the galaxy looking for sentient races to eliminate."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wander the galaxy looking for sentient races to aid and protect."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What are von Neumann Machines?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Self-replicating machines"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Machines created by aliens"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Machines that run on von Neumann energy"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How did von Neumann build his machines?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "From paper and glue"}, {"label": "B", "text": "From wood and ceramics"}, {"label": "C", "text": "From metal and electrical wires"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above; von Neumann did not actually build any"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why are some people concerned about von Neumann Machines?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because they could self-replicate and deplete the resources on planets in the universe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because they could be built in order to eradicate life"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because we may be able to build them in the future"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How long would it take for a single von Neumann Machine (travelling at 10 percent the speed of light) to replicate throughout the galaxy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10-50 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Thousands of years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Millions of years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Billions of years"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Alien von Neumann Machines:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Are keeping close watch over the Earth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Have not yet been discovered"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prowl the galaxy looking for sentient races to eliminate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wander the galaxy looking for sentient races to aid and protect"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Brown", "category": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-history-of-african-american-social-dance-camille-a-brown", "transcript": {"en": "This is the Bop. The Bop is a type of social dance. Dance is a language, and social dance is an expression\nthat emerges from a community. A social dance isn't choreographed\nby any one person. It can't be traced to any one moment. Each dance has steps\nthat everyone can agree on, but it's about the individual\nand their creative identity. Because of that, social dances bubble up, they change, and they spread like wildfire. They are as old as our remembered history. In African-American social dances, we see over 200 years of how African and African-American\ntraditions influenced our history. The present always contains the past. And the past shapes who we are and who we will be. (Clapping) The Juba dance was born\nfrom enslaved Africans' experience on the plantation. Brought to the Americas, stripped of a common spoken language, this dance was a way for enslaved Africans\nto remember where they're from. It may have looked something like this. Slapping thighs, shuffling feet and patting hands: this was how they got around\nthe slave owners' ban on drumming, improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did\nwith drums in Haiti or in the Yoruba communities\nof West Africa. It was about keeping\ncultural traditions alive and retaining a sense of inner freedom under captivity. It was the same subversive spirit\nthat created this dance: the Cakewalk, a dance that parodied the mannerisms\nof Southern high society -- a way for the enslaved\nto throw shade at the masters. The crazy thing about this dance is that the Cakewalk\nwas performed for the masters, who never suspected\nthey were being made fun of. Now you might recognize this one. 1920s -- the Charleston. The Charleston was all about\nimprovisation and musicality, making its way into Lindy Hop, swing dancing and even the Kid n Play, originally called the Funky Charleston. Started by a tight-knit Black community\nnear Charleston, South Carolina, the Charleston permeated dance halls where young women suddenly had\nthe freedom to kick their heels and move their legs. Now, social dance is about\ncommunity and connection; if you knew the steps, it meant you belonged to a group. But what if it becomes a worldwide craze? Enter the Twist. It's no surprise that the Twist\ncan be traced back to the 19th century, brought to America from the Congo during slavery. But in the late '50s, right before the Civil Rights Movement, the Twist is popularized\nby Chubby Checker and Dick Clark. Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist: white teenagers, kids in Latin America, making its way into songs and movies. Through social dance, the boundaries between groups\nbecome blurred. The story continues in the 1980s and '90s. Along with the emergence of hip-hop, African-American social dance\ntook on even more visibility, borrowing from its long past, shaping culture and being shaped by it. Today, these dances continue\nto evolve, grow and spread. Why do we dance? To move, to let loose, to express. Why do we dance together? To heal, to remember, to say: \"We speak a common language. We exist and we are free.\""}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which description(s) below best describe social dance? 1. It is choreographed by one person. 2.

{"page": 36, "lesson": 14, "title": "How hormones work", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/FPIV9mVc", "transcript": {"en": "I’ve invited you all here today because\nI wanted to talk to you about some ugly stereotypes that are going around. I’ve been hearing a lot of unfair, unseemly, and\nunscientific generalizations being made lately. And they mostly have to do with sex. And your hormones. People have a nasty habit of equating “hormones”\nwith a particular set of behaviors and conditions, most of which have to do with reproduction,\nor sexual development, or acts that include what my brother John has referred to as “skoodilypooping.” For example, people will say that “hormones”\nare why Kevin has zits, and is being all moody, or why Hannah, who’s three months pregnant,\njust cried watching a commercial for car insurance -- which, let’s be honest, I do that too. Now, I’m not saying that hormones aren’t\nat the root of sexual attraction, or zits, or occasional bouts of extreme emotion, because\nthey are. That’s just not all that they do. Not even close. When people talk about “hormones” in\nthe contexts that I just mentioned, what really they mean is \"sex hormones.\" But sex hormones are just one kind of hormone\nthat you have coursing through your body right now. In fact, there are at least 50 different types\nof these chemical messengers at work in your body at this very minute, but only a very few\nof them have anything at all to do with sex. The truth is, from birth to death, just about\nevery cell and function in your body is under your hormones’ constant influence. They’re floating through your blood, regulating\nyour metabolism, your sleep cycle, your response to stress, and the general and incredibly important\noverall homeostasis that keeps you not dead. Some hormones are just there to make other\nhormones trigger even more hormones -- in a kind of chemical relay race that biologists\nrefer to, rather elegantly, as “cascades.” These hormones run through you no matter what\nyour mood is, or whether you have zits. So the reality is: We’re all hormonal ... all\nof the time. OK, to begin to understand our hormones -- and\nthe endocrine system that produces, releases, and re-absorbs them -- we have to step back\nand take a broad view. Not just by emphasizing that sex hormones aren’t\nthe only hormones you have -- but also by looking at how your hormones interact with\nyour other organ systems. Because, if anything, your body has two bosses\n-- two complementary systems that are constantly shouting instructions over each other, to\nall of your bits and pieces. Both your endocrine system and your nervous\nsystem are constantly trafficking information around your corpus, gathering intel, making\ndemands, controlling your every move. They just have totally different ways of doing\nit. Your nervous system uses lightning-fast\nelectrochemical action potentials, delivered by an expressway made of\nneurons to specific cells and organs. But your endocrine system prefers a slower,\nwider stream of data. It secretes hormones that travel through your\nblood -- NOT through neurons -- so they move more slowly, but they also produce widespread effects\nthat last a whole lot longer than an action potential. Now, compared to your heart or brain or other,\narguably more glamorous organs, your endocrine system’s organs and glands are kinda small\nand lumpy. They’re also rogues -- instead of being all\nnestled together like in your other organ systems, these guys are scattered all over the place, from your\nbrain to your throat, to your kidneys, to your genitals. A gland is a just any structure that makes\nand secretes a hormone. And the master gland in your body is the pituitary, which produces\nmany hormones that signal other glands -- like the thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, and pineal\nglands -- to make their own hormones. The endocrine system also includes a few organs\n-- like the gonads, the pancreas, and the placenta in pregnant women -- all of which\nhave some other non-hormonal functions and are made up of multiple tissue types. And technically the hypothalamus in your brain\nis in the endocrine club too, since in addition to all of its busy brain duties, it does produce\nand release hormones. So, thanks to these glands and organs, you’ve got\nall these hormones diffusing through your blood, doing all sorts of different things, but the thing to\nremember about them is that a hormone can only trigger a reaction in specific cells -- their so-called\ntarget cells -- that have the right receptors for it. So, just like some keys can open many locks,\nwhile others only work with one, so too can the hormone-target-cell relationship either\nbe widespread or localized. You’re probably gonna want an example of\nthat. So, your thyroid -- at the bottom of your throat -- produces the hormone thyroxine,\nwhich stimulates metabolism and binds to receptors in most of the cells in your body. But your pituitary -- which is nestled all\ncomfy under your brain -- produces follicle-stimulating hormone, which helps regulate growth and triggers\nsexual maturity, and it only targets specific cells in the ovaries and testes. So how do hormones bind to their target cells? Well, chemically, most hormones are either\nmade of amino acids -- including their more complex structures like peptides or proteins\n-- or they’re derived from lipids, like cholesterol. And this is key, because a hormone’s chemical\nstructure determines if it’s water soluble, like most amino acid-based ones are, or lipid\nsoluble, like steroids are. Solubility is important because your cell\nmembranes are made of lipids. That means that water soluble ones can’t\nget across them. So target cells for those kinds of hormones have receptors for them\non the outside of their membranes. Lipid-soluble hormones, on the other hand,\ncan just basically glide right through that cell membrane, so their receptor sites are\ninside their target cells. Either way, when a target cell is activated,\nthe hormone alters its activity, by either increasing or decreasing some of its functions\n-- usually with the goal of maintaining your body’s homeostasis in one way or another. So, if hormones are keeping your body IN balance,\nwhat’s putting your body out of balance? I don’t know -- could I interest you in\nsome pie? If you have a couple of nice, generous helpings\nof strawberry-rhubarb pie -- and just to make things interesting, let’s say they’re a la mode --\nyour blood glucose level is gonna go through the roof. And the pancreas regulates your blood sugar by\nreleasing two different hormones -- insulin and glucagon. Once you have a belly full of that pie,\nbeta cells in your pancreas release insulin, which helps lower your blood sugar by increasing\nthe rate at which your cells store the sugar either as glycogen or as fat for later use. Now, let’s say you’ve done the opposite:\nYou’ve eaten no pie -- you’re pie-less -- in fact, you’ve eaten nothing for hours. If your blood sugar drops too low, then alpha\ncells in the pancreas will instead send out glucagon, which helps raise your blood sugar\nlevels, in part by decreasing the storage of sugar in your cells, and triggering their\nrelease of glucose back into the blood. Lots of different endocrine-related illnesses\n-- like diabetes or hyperthyroidism -- tend to be the result of either hyper (too much)\nor hypo (too little) secretion of certain hormones, which throw your homeostasis off\nbalance. But there are lots of more common -- and less\nobvious -- ways your hormones can get out of balance, not because of some disorder,\nbut because these signaling chemicals are just caught up in a chain reaction, which\ncan take a while to subside. Some hormones just exist to control other\nhormones, which in turn control still more hormones. So as soon as one starts to trickle out, you can\npretty quickly wind up with a cascade on your hands. You’ve got a few different hormone cascades\ngoing on at any given moment, but one of the big ones -- one that’s really worth understanding\n-- is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, or the HPA axis, because you don’t want\nto have to say that every time. This is a complex series of interactions between\nthree glands that ultimately regulates lots of your body’s daily processes, like digestion, sexuality,\nimmune response, and how you handle stress. And it’s complex not just because of all\nthe glands involved -- it’s also one of the more crucial instances of your endocrine\nsystem coordinating with your nervous system. Specifically, it’s behind that fight-or-flight\nresponse that everybody keeps talking about. The HPA Axis is essentially the endocrine system’s\ncompanion to the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic system, in times of high stress,\ndoes things like speed up your heart rate and direct blood away from the digestive organs\nand to the muscles. But many of the other effects of the stress\nresponse are carried out by your endocrine system. And getting your nervous and endocrine\nsystems to work together in times of crisis is where the hypothalamus comes in. It’s the hub of where the two systems meet\n-- it keeps tabs on what’s going on all over your body, analyzing your blood for signs\nthat something might be off. So, let’s revisit our fight-or-flight scene from a few\nlessons ago -- the old Burning House Scenario. So you’re sleeping, dreaming about petting pandas with\nEmma Watson or whatever, when the smoke alarm goes off. Well, action potentials in your brain trigger\nneurons in your hypothalamus to release the peptide hormone CRH, or corticotropin releasing hormone. The CRH makes the very short trip through\nthe bloodstream to the anterior pituitary gland, where, because it’s water soluble, it\nbinds to receptors on the outside of its target cells. There, it triggers the release of adrenocorticotropic\nhormone, or ACTH. The ACTH travels -- again through the bloodstream -- to the adrenal cortices\nof the adrenal glands on top of your kidneys. When the ACTH binds to receptors on cells\nin an adrenal cortex, it triggers the release of a frenzy of different freak-out compounds known\nas glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. Typically these guys help us deal with day-to-day stress\nby keeping our blood sugar and blood pressure balanced. But under major stress -- like waking up\nin a burning building stress -- these hormones, like cortisol, cause the classic fight-or-flight\nresponse: ramping up your blood pressure, dumping glucose into your bloodstream, shutting\ndown non-emergency services like your immune system and sperm and egg development. And guess what? Now that all these stress\nhormones are pulsing through your blood, the hypothalamus back in the brain senses them. And because its job is to monitor and maintain\nbalance whenever possible, it then stops secreting CRH, which -- eventually -- causes the other\nglands to stop secreting their panic hormones. Now, because this element of the stress response\nis hormonal rather than electrical, it comes on more slowly than the nervous system part,\nand it takes longer to subside, too, as those stress hormones linger in the blood before\nbeing broken down by enzymes. So. We’re a long way from teenage crushes and zits\nand crying over commercials at this point, aren’t we? As a life-long owner of hormones, I hope you’ll\njoin me in dispelling the stereotypes that surround these powerful and important chemicals,\nand give them the respect they rightly deserve. Today we looked at the endocrine system, and\nhow it uses glands to produce hormones. These hormones are either amino-acid based and water\nsoluble, or steroidal and lipid-soluble, and may target many types of cells or just turn\non specific ones. We also touched on hormone cascades, and how the HPA axis effects your\nstress response.

Jordan", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-history-of-the-cuban-missile-crisis-matthew-a-jordan", "transcript": {"en": "It's not hard to imagine a world\nwhere at any given moment, you and everyone you know could be\nwiped out without warning at the push of a button. This was the reality for millions\nof people during the 45-year period after World War II, now known as the Cold War. As the United States and Soviet Union\nfaced off across the globe, each knew that the other had nuclear\nweapons capable of destroying it. And destruction never loomed closer\nthan during the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1961, the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to\noverthrow Cuba's new communist government. That failed attempt was known\nas the Bay of Pigs, and it convinced Cuba to seek help\nfrom the U.S.S.R. Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev\nwas happy to comply by secretly deploying nuclear\nmissiles to Cuba, not only to protect the island, but to counteract the threat from\nU.S. missiles in Italy and Turkey. By the time U.S. intelligence \ndiscovered the plan, the materials to create the missiles\nwere already in place. At an emergency meeting on\nOctober 16, 1962, military advisors urged an airstrike\non missile sites and invasion of the island. But President John F. Kennedy chose\na more careful approach. On October 22, he announced that the\nthe U.S. Navy would intercept all shipments to Cuba. There was just one problem: a naval blockade was considered\nan act of war. Although the President called it\na quarantine that did not block basic necessities, the Soviets didn't appreciate \nthe distinction. In an outraged letter to Kennedy, Khrushchev wrote, \"The violation \nof freedom to use international waters and international airspace\nis an act of aggression which pushes mankind toward the abyss\nof world nuclear missile war.\" Thus ensued the most intense\nsix days of the Cold War. While the U.S. demanded the removal\nof the missiles, Cuba and the U.S.S.R insisted\nthey were only defensive. And as the weapons continued\nto be armed, the U.S. prepared for a possible invasion. On October 27, a spy plane piloted\nby Major Rudolph Anderson was shot down by a Soviet missile. The same day, a nuclear-armed Soviet\nsubmarine was hit by a small-depth charge from a U.S. Navy vessel trying\nto signal it to come up. The commanders on the sub,\ntoo deep to communicate with the surface, thought war had begun\nand prepared to launch a nuclear torpedo. That decision had to be made unanimously\nby three officers. The captain and political officer\nboth authorized the launch, but Vasili Arkhipov, \nsecond in command, refused. His decision saved the day\nand perhaps the world. But the crisis wasn't over. For the first time in history, the U.S. Military set itself\nto DEFCON 2, the defense readiness one step\naway from nuclear war. With hundreds of nuclear missiles\nready to launch, the metaphorical Doomsday Clock\nstood at one minute to midnight. But diplomacy carried on. In Washington, D.C., Attorney General\nRobert Kennedy secretly met with Soviet Ambassador\nAnatoly Dobrynin. After intense negotiation,\nthey reached the following proposal. The U.S. would remove their missiles\nfrom Turkey and Italy and promise to never invade Cuba in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal\nfrom Cuba under U.N. inspection. Once the meeting had concluded, Dobrynin cabled Moscow saying \ntime is of the essence and we shouldn't miss the chance. And at 9 a.m. the next day, a message arrived from Khrushchev announcing the Soviet missiles would be\nremoved from Cuba. The crisis was now over. While criticized at the time by their\nrespective governments for bargaining with the enemy, contemporary historical analysis\nshows great admiration for Kennedy's and Khrushchev's ability\nto diplomatically solve the crisis. But the disturbing lesson was that\na slight communication error, or split-second decision by a commander,\ncould have thwarted all their efforts, as it nearly did if not for \nVasili Arkhipov's courageous choice. The Cuban Missile Crisis revealed just how\nfragile human politics are compared to the terrifying power\nthey can unleash."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Soviet Union placed missiles in Cuba in order to ___ the island of Cuba.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Attack"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Defend"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Conquer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Colonize"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The United States called the blockade a quarantine because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Quarantine sounds better than a blockade"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Quarantine is the correct military term"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A blockade is a term for war; a quarantine isn’t"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A blockade suggests illness"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Cuban Missile Crisis is when the US reached which DEFCON level?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which government individuals negotiated the end of the Crisis on October 27?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Robert Kennedy and Vasili Arkhipov"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Vasili Arhkipov and Anatoly Dobrynin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Robert Kennedy and Anatoly Dobrynin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "John F.

You might find SnapDragon, Pixie Crunch, Cosmic Crisp, Jazz, or Ambrosia next to the more familiar\nRed Delicious and Granny Smith. These delightfully descriptive names belong to just a handful of the over\n7,500 apple varieties in the world. This huge diversity exists largely because\nof humanity's efforts to bear new fruit. Fruit breeding is a way to fulfill\nthe expectations of farmers and consumers who seek specific qualities in an apple. On the one hand, farmers may want them\nto be disease-resistant and to store well. On the other, consumers are swayed\nby appearance, taste, and novelty. So, breeders have to consider everything from how well apples grow\nin certain climates to their color, taste, and size. And sometimes finding the perfect\nfit means breeding something new. To create apples \nwith desirable characteristics, breeders first need to find parent\napples that carry those characteristics. Once the parents have been selected, they have to wait until the trees\nbloom in the spring. The breeder takes the pollen\nfrom one bloom, called the father, and transfers it by hand to the other\nparent bloom, called the mother, through a process \ncalled cross-pollination. Once the mother bloom \nturns into an apple, the seeds are collected and then planted. It takes about five years for these seeds\nto grow into trees that produce apples, but because of the way \ntraits are inherited, all of the seedlings produced will have\ndifferent sets of genes and characteristics. This means that to achieve \na desired quality, it takes a lot of offspring, not to mention patience \non the breeder's part. When a seedling does bear fruit\nwith the desired qualities, it's selected for further evaluation. Of the original crossed seedlings, about one in every 5,000 makes it\nto this prestigious stage. They're then sent to new farms where breeders can assess how various\nclimates and soil types affect the plant's growth. The fruit of the seedling \nand its many clones must then be collected and sampled\nto ensure consistency. Breeders study about 45 traits\nin an apple, like the texture \nand firmness of the flesh, when it ripens, how sugary its juice is, and how long it stays fresh. Over several years, they weed out\nall the bad apples, selecting only those \nwhose fruits are the best. These exclusive plants \nofficially form the cultivar, or new apple variety. To ensure an exact copy of this cultivar, all apple trees must be grafted \nfrom the original seedling. Branches, called scion wood, are cut from the original tree \nand grown to generate more scion wood. Segments of these trees are then grafted\nonto root stalk - that's the lower section of another tree that's been chosen \nfrom a different cultivar for its superior roots \nand growing ability. Finally, this fusion creates \na new apple tree with the desired qualities. Each new plant takes up to four years before it starts producing \nthe fruit we eat. Apple breeding may be a difficult art,\nbut it's accessible to all: universities, companies, and even individuals can create\nnew cultivars. But to fully own an apple, the breeder\nfaces a final challenge - naming the fruit. After a cultivar is patented, a breeder chooses a name\nfor its trademark. That final step grants them long-lasting\nrights over the apple and its clones. That name must be completely original, and the catchier, the better, of course. With over 7,500 varieties and counting, that's why we have apples called\nPink Lady, Sweet Tango, Kiku, and EverCrisp. The more we work with nature's bounty\nto breed new cultivars, the more creative and delectable\nthese names will become."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The way to create a copy of a desired apple tree is to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Plant the seeds of the apple."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Graft scion wood from the original tree."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Graft rootstock from the original tree."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cross pollinate the blooms during bloom season."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The way to create a copy of a desired apple tree is to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Plant the seeds of the apple"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Graft scion wood from the original tree"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Graft rootstock from the original tree"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cross pollinate the blooms during bloom season"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is a cultivar?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A type of tree"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A new variety"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A type of apple"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The flowers on apple trees"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many apple varieties are there in the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5,500"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "7,500"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8,000"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who can create new varieties of apples?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Clubs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Universities"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Individuals"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the purpose of creating new apple varieties?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To create an apple that is disease resistant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To create an apple that is appealing to consumers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To create an apple that stores well"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

And so you can see they're\nactually quite tremendous ants, I mean, they're really foreboding,\n[* worker bullet ants are 18–30 mm long] they're crazy big and they're cool.\n[* worker bullet ants are 18–30 mm long] - Are they the largest ant? - They're one of the largest ants. There's another genus called Dinoponera.\n[Dinoponera, Dinoponera australis] In some ways larger.\n[* females may surpass 30–40 mm in length] Not as painful of a sting, though.\n[* females may surpass 30–40 mm in length] This is Paraponera.\n[Bullet ant, Paraponera clavata] We're studying the gut bacteria\nactually in this group of ants. But we're also\ninterested in the venom. And so what I was telling\nyou is part of the reason I brought them back\nalive is that at one point I had tried to milk them, because\nmy colleague was like, \"It's because we weren't sure if\nwe'd have permits to bring back alive.\" - Yeah.\n- You can just milk them. So I can show you how\nI attempted to do it and I will tell you that it\ndidn't work in the end. When I got the venom back\nit was actually not usable. But let me grab my equipment. - It's not every day you get to\nmilk a venomous ant. At work. - So this is our fancy equipment. So if you think about, like, how they milk the venom\nfrom spiders, right? Usually they just have\nthem bite something and squirt the venom inside\nand it's the same principle. So again, we just have\nour empty tubes, and we have a little\nbit of parafilm, right, which is essentially just like\na waxy kind of paper-y thing that we can stretch\nacross the top of this. And we're going to get them\nto try to sting through the tube and deposit their venom\non the side of the tube. - Wow.\n- Yeah. One thing I have noticed is, what's really interesting\nactually, is with these bullet ants, when you collect them in the\nwild they're incredibly aggressive. You disturb them at all, and they\njust go into immediate attack mode. In fact in the field, if you\neven like blow on them, you can physically\nhear them stridulate, which is a way of communicating\nbetween individuals. And now that they've been\nin the lab for just a few days, they're actually almost docile. And so I'm curious to see whether\nthey'll even sting through this. But we'll try. Yeah, see, this one stridulates. So now let's see if we\nput her abdomen up, yeah, she is depositing\nher sting through. - Oh!\n- See that? - Sting it! Sting it! - So you see, she's got her sting out, this is where I don't want\nto lose control of her. She'll try to sting through, oh, there, you saw that sting go? That's huge. \n- Yeah. Wow. Focus your anger. - We will try to get another one to sting \n- Come on, ladies. - You look like a new victim,\nraaah, let's get her all mad. - Yeaaaah! Oh, she's stridulating. - She's actually kinda not\nmad as much anymore. - They're—they're just\nlike, they're like, \"Corrie, we wanna hang out,\nI thought we were cool.\" - I know, that's probably\nexactly what they think. - Like, \"Come on, Corrie,\" \"I read your latest paper about\nclimactic regional distribution\" \"of my sister species.\" I don't even know if that's\nwhat you've written about, I don't even know if that—\nthose words even make sense. - You don't read all my\nscientific publications? - Um, I probably couldn't\nget through the abstract. Not—not just yours, but most. - I won't take it personally. Oh, yeah, she's got a very big sting,\nso let's see if I can get her to— - Yeah. Sting it. - So that's how you milk a\nbullet ant for their venom. So essentially, just getting them\nto sting through this material, they have now\ndeposited their venom all over the top of this\nand inside of that tube, so I can just shove\nthat in there and then take it back\nto an analytical lab to look at what are the—what's\nthe chemistry within the venom. Now, I've already told you that\nthat didn't work so successfully, so in a sense, what we need to do\nis dissect out the venom glad, and that's where it\ngets a little more tricky, because in this case, you\ncan see they're big and— - Cranky. - Cranky. And they\ndon't like to hold still. Do this under the microscope. Okay, so now, again, we're\ngonna just pull off her abdomen, oh God, these are some tough ants.\n[* abdomen] Even tougher than the bullet ants.\n- Wow. - So now we've got—\n- You did it. - —her body separated\nfrom her abdomen. I wanna just tease apart some\nof the parts of the abdomen and then we can usually pull the\nvenom gland out through the sting. So I'm just gonna start\npulling apart the body, and since I don't want to\nrupture the venom gland, I wanna try not to stab too much. - Yeah, this is meticulous work, dissecting ants. \n- Yeah. - What is the smallest ant that\nyou'll work on under a microscope? - Oh, I'll work on anyone. - Even the ones\nthat are so small that you can't even see\nthem on the labels? - Yep, even those. I've had to\ndissect out their guts, too. - How do you even get\nforceps that small? - Suspense, right? \n- Yeah, the pressure. - Yeah, nothing like having\nto dissect on camera, too. As if it's not hard enough, right? - Yeah, all the viewers are\nat home, quietly judging you. They're like, \"Well, when\nI dissected ants last—\" - I was thinking they were biting\ntheir fingernails in suspense. - Yeah, that too. - So at the one end, let's see if I can put it\nin a good orientation— you can actually\nsee the left side, if you look through\nthe microscope, you can actually see the sting hanging all the way out.\n[* sting] - Oh yeah!\n- It's like a giant hypodermic needle. - Yeah. - And then starting at the\nother end on the right side, we can actually start to see\nthose parts of the digestive system. So first you have the crop, right?\n[* crop] So it's that social food sharing organ,\nwhich then transitions into the mid gut and then into what's called the ileum\n[* mid gut, * ileum] and then finally into the rectum,\n[* rectum] and then alongside that is where the venom gland sits.\n[* venom gland] - That's amazing.\n- Yeah, it's really awesome. One of the things that's cool\nwhen you first open them up is that the contents within the gut, you can see fat and\nyou can see the trachea and all those other things,\nand even within the gut, it's either clear like it\nalmost looks like water, or sometimes you can see\nthings that look like waste, but within the venom sac,\nit's actually almost like oil. And so when you burst it,\nit's literally like oil coming out, not like liquid, like, you\nknow, in the same sense. - Cool.\n- Yeah. - Nice.\n- So now the question is, are you gonna hold\na bullet ant for 10 seconds?

{"page": 36, "lesson": 18, "title": "How Americans got stuck with endless drug commercials", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/ADOWlyRT", "transcript": {"en": "In most of the world, this is a strange sight. It’s a TV commercial for a prescription drug. These ads are illegal in most countries. but in the US, they’re everywhere. On average, 80 of them air every hour on American television. \"Ask your doctor.\" \"...my doctor told me...\" \"Ask your doctor.\" The American Medical Association, a major group of doctors, has called for a ban on these direct-to-consumer ads. But there’s a case to be made for them too. So today we’ll take a look at both sides. First, a little background. Before the 1980s, prescription drug commercials were unheard of in the US. Drug companies focused their marketing solely on doctors, and they didn’t want to hurt those relationships. When asked by Congress in 1984, if direct-to-consumer advertising should be allowed, one pharmaceutical executive said: And an executive at Schering-Plough, which is now part of Merck, said: Needless to say, they changed their minds. At the time there was a larger cultural shift\nin health care toward empowering patients to make decisions rather than just listening\nto their doctors. And advertisements fit with that trend. Drug Ads started appearing in print publications, but there was still another thing keeping them off TV, and that was FDA’s regulations at the\ntime. They were interpreted as requiring ads to\ninclude all of the information about the drug’s risks and side effects, which simply wasn’t feasible to do in a tv or radio commercial the way it was in\na magazine. There was a bizarre loophole though: The ads didn’t have to mention the drug’s risks, if they also didn’t mention the disease\nor condition that the drug was supposed to treat. Here’s what that looked like — in an ad\nfor Claritin back before it was available over the counter: \"It’s time.\" \"It’s time!\" \"Don’t wait another minute with Claritin.\" \"Claritin.\" \"I’ll ask my doctor!\" \"It’s time to see your doctor.\" \"Mr. Wilkin, the doctor will see you now.\" \"At last, a clear day is here.\" Confused? Yeah, everyone was. So in 1997, the FDA clarified that the industry could run the full drug ads and wouldn’t have to give ALL the risk information from\nthe label, as long as they included the major side effects and referred viewers to another source for the rest. That’s why the commercials direct us to\nphone numbers or print ads. Come for the pharmaceutical fine print — stay for “the secret to crisp contact in soggy conditions” That new FDA guidance removed the main barrier keeping drugs off of television. and you can guess what happened next... spending on ads quadrupled by 2004. And now, we know the names of prescription drugs like we know the names of cars and clothing brands. \"Lunesta, Xanax, Celebrex, Flomax, and HGH.\" \"And as of Thursday, Lipitor.\" \"Oh and if you have trouble sleeping, Marla has Ambien. I prefer Lunesta.\" \"Lipitor, Baby Aspirin... Flomax.\" \"Flomax?\" \"…and some Cialis! I’m just assuming.\" So that’s how we got here. Drug ads are now the most frequent form of health communication that most Americans see. So what does that mean for public health? Are those prescriptions going to the right\npeople? Or are they going to people who probably won’t benefit from the drug — people for whom the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits? Well, the answer seems to be: both. A clever experiment in 2005 tested this by\nsending actors to real primary care doctors. Dr. Richard Kravitz: We helped them make appointments. In half of the visits, the actors reported\nsymptoms of depression. In the other half of the visits, the actors\nsaid they were feeling down after becoming unemployed. The study authors called this an “adjustment disorder.” In some visits, the actors mentioned seeing\nan advertisement for Paxil on TV, that's an antidepressant. In others, they didn’t bring up medication\nat all. And the doctors seemed to take patients more seriously if they mentioned seeing the Paxil commercial. They were more likely to refer patients to\na mental health consultation, And much more likely to prescribe an antidepressant. That may be a good thing for those with major depression, who might benefit from an medication. But it’s more questionable for those with\na more temporary condition. This study, and others, have shown that doctors can be persuaded to broaden the scope of who gets treated with drugs. And advertisements often seem designed to encourage that. Take Androgel — it was approved to treat men with hypogonadism: that’s extremely low testosterone levels due to injury or disease. But here’s how it was promoted by Abbott:\n\"Millions of men 45 and older just don’t feel like they used to. Are you one of them? Remember when you had more energy for 18 holes with your buddies? More passion for the one you love.\" Some middle aged men don’t feel like they\nused to? You don’t say. A study looking back at 10 years of testosterone prescriptions found that only half had been diagnosed with hypogonadism in the previous year. Drug ads give the industry an incentive to\nmake healthy people feel unhealthy. “Latisse is the only FDA approved prescription treatment for inadequate, or not enough lashes.” And they contribute to unrealistic expectations about what pharmaceuticals can do. So what’s wrong with that? Well, every single drug comes with risks. Big ad campaigns are usually for newer drugs, for which not all the risks may be known yet. In the case of the painkiller Vioxx, a massive ad campaign led millions of people with arthritis to switch to Vioxx instead of sticking with\nolder drugs like Ibuprofen. “It’s a beautiful morning…ask your doctor\ntoday about Vioxx, and find out what Vioxx can do for you.\" Vioxx was more expensive and not actually more effective, and... “The manufacturer of Vioxx have just recently pulled this popular arthritis drug from the market over health concerns.\" Merck withdrew the drug after it became clear that it increased the risk of heart attacks\nand stroke. A Kaiser Permanente study later confirmed\nthat ad exposure was linked to inappropriate prescribing of Vioxx and a similar drug called Celebrex. So that’s a worst case scenario. But there is also an argument that these ads can be good for public health. Sidney Taurel: “There are many diseases for which people don’t seek treatment. So if you can educate through direct-to-consumer\nabout the fact that this can be treated, you will get a better outcome for everyone.” In their view, more communication with your doctor is always a good thing. And it’s up to the doctor to make the right\nprescribing decisions. Surveys of the public have confirmed that\ndrug ads prompt people to visit their doctor, in some cases for diabetes, hypertension, depression — these are conditions that are thought to be under treated. In the case of the HPV vaccine, that's now recommended for all pre-teens to prevent cervical and other cancers, Merck’s ad blitz for Gardasil\nprobably reached more people than a government communications effort could. And whatever you think of erectile dysfunction drugs, they got men to see their doctors and undergo the required heart screening, potentially catching problems not yet treated. But the strongest argument in favor of drug\nads may be the legal one. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of prescription drug advertising back in the 1970s, when the state of Virginia tried to prohibit pharmacists from advertising their prices. Harry Blackmun: “We further hold that so called commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection of the 1st and 14th amendments. The individual consumer and society in general may have strong interests in the free flow of commercial information.” It was the first time that the Court said\nadvertisements were entitled to free speech protections. There was only one dissenting Justice at the time: William Rehnquist — who Ronald Reagan would later appoint Chief Justice —\nIn his dissent, Rehnquist wrote a kind of uncanny prediction of the type of commercials that would come decades later: \"Don't spend another sleepless night. Ask your doctor to prescribe Seconal without delay.\" Rehnquist worried that ads would “generate patient pressure on physicians to prescribe” drugs; and that they’d end up being “advertised on television.” And as we know now, for better or for worse, that’s exactly what happened."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When did direct-to-consumer drug ads start appearing in the U.S.?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1940s"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1950s"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1980s"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1990s"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Until 1997, because of FDA regulations, drug commercials on TV didn't have to mention the side effects of the drug, if they didn't mention...", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the disease the drug was intended to treat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the benefits of the drug"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the generic version of the drug"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

I have two primary personalities that have been in conflict\nand conversation within me since I was a little girl. I call them \"the mystic\"\nand \"the warrior.\" I was born into a family of politically\nactive intellectual atheists. There was this equation in my family\nthat went something like this: if you are intelligent, you therefore are not spiritual. I was the freak of the family. I was this weird little kid who wanted to have deep talks\nabout the worlds that might exist beyond the ones we perceive\nwith our senses. I wanted to know if what we human beings see\nand hear and think is a full and accurate picture of reality. So, looking for answers, I went to Catholic mass;\nI tagged along with my neighbors. I read Sartre and Socrates. And then a wonderful thing happened\nwhen I was in high school: gurus from the East started washing up\non the shores of America. (Laughter) And I said to myself,\n\"I wanna get me one of them.\" (Laughter) And ever since, I've been walking\nthe mystic path, trying to peer beyond\nwhat Albert Einstein called the \"optical delusion\"\nof everyday consciousness. So what did he mean by this? I'll show you. Take a breath right now\nof this clear air in this room. Now, see this strange, underwater-coral-reef-looking thing? It's actually a person's trachea. And those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around\nin this room right now, all around us. If we're blind to this simple biology, imagine what we're missing\nat the smallest subatomic level right now and at the grandest cosmic levels. My years as a mystic have made me question\nalmost all my assumptions. They've made me a proud\n\"I-don't-know-it-all.\" Now, when the mystic part of me\njabbers on and on like this, the warrior rolls her eyes. She's concerned about what's happening\nin this world right now. She's worried. She says, \"Excuse me, I'm pissed off, and I know a few things, and we better get busy\nabout them right now.\" I've spent my life as a warrior, working for women's issues, working on political campaigns, being an activist for the environment. And it can be sort of crazymaking, housing both the mystic\nand the warrior in one body. I've always been attracted\nto those rare people who pull that off, who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior\nand the grace of the mystic -- people like Martin Luther King, Jr., who wrote, \"I can never be\nwhat I ought to be until you are what you ought to be.\" \"This,\" he wrote, \"is the interrelated\nstructure of reality.\" Then Mother Teresa,\nanother mystic warrior, who said, \"The problem with the world\nis that we draw the circle of our family too small.\" And Nelson Mandela, who lives\nby the African concept of \"ubuntu,\" which means \"I need you in order to be me, and you need me in order to be you.\" Now, we all love to trot out\nthese three mystic warriors as if they were born with a \"saint\" gene. But we all actually have\nthe same capacity that they do. And we need to do their work now. I'm deeply disturbed by the ways in which all of our cultures\nare demonizing \"the other,\" by the voice we're giving\nto the most divisive among us. Listen to these titles\nof some of the best-selling books from both sides of the political divide here in the US: \"Liberalism is a Mental Disorder,\" \"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot,\" \"Pinheads and Patriots,\" \"Arguing with Idiots.\" They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek, but they're actually dangerous. Now here's a title\nthat may sound familiar, but whose author may surprise you: \"Four and a Half Years\nof Struggle Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice.\" Who wrote that? That was Adolf Hitler's first title\nfor \"Mein Kampf\" -- \"My Struggle\" -- the book that launched the Nazi Party. The worst eras in human history, whether in Cambodia\nor Germany or Rwanda -- they start like this,\nwith negative otherizing. And then they morph\ninto violent extremism. This is why I'm launching\na new initiative. And it's to help all of us,\nmyself included, to counteract the tendency to otherize. And I realize we're all busy people, so don't worry, you can do this\non a lunch break. I'm calling my initiative\n\"Take the Other to Lunch.\" If you are a Republican, you can take a Democrat to lunch. Or if you're a Democrat, think of it as taking\na Republican to lunch. Now, if the idea of taking\nany of these people to lunch makes you lose your appetite, (Laughter) I suggest you start more local, because there is no shortage of the other\nright in your own neighborhood: maybe that person\nwho worships at the mosque or the church or the synagogue\ndown the street; or someone from the other side\nof the abortion conflict; or maybe your brother-in-law\nwho doesn't believe in global warming -- (Laughter) anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you or whose point of view\nmakes smoke come out of your ears. A couple of weeks ago, I took a conservative\nTea Party woman to lunch. Now, on paper, she passed\nmy \"smoking ears\" test: (Laughter) she's an activist from the Right, and I'm an activist from the Left. We used some guidelines\nto keep our conversation elevated. And you can use them, too, because I know you're all going\nto take an other to lunch. So first of all, decide on a goal: to get to know one person from a group\nyou may have negatively stereotyped. And then, before you get together, agree on some ground rules. My Tea Party lunch mate and I\ncame up with these: \"Don't persuade, defend or interrupt; be curious, be conversational, be real; and listen.\" From there, we dove in,\nand we used these questions: \"Share some of your life\nexperiences with me -- what issues deeply concern you? And what have you always wanted to ask\nsomeone from the other side?\" My lunch partner and I came away\nwith some really important insights, and I'm going to share just one with you. I think it has relevance to any problem\nbetween people anywhere. I asked her why her side makes\nsuch outrageous allegations and lies about my side. \"What?\" she wanted to know. \"Like, we're a bunch of elitist,\nmorally corrupt terrorist-lovers.\" Well, she was shocked. She thought my side beat up\non her side way more often -- that we called them brainless,\ngun-toting racists. And we both marveled at the labels that fit none of the people\nwe actually know. And since we had established some trust, we believed in each other's sincerity. We agreed we'd speak up\nin our own communities when we witnessed\nthe kind of \"otherizing\" talk that can wound and fester into paranoia and then be used by those on the fringes to incite. By the end of our lunch,\nwe acknowledged each other's openness. Neither of us had tried\nto change the other, but we also hadn't pretended that our differences\nwere just going to melt away after a lunch. Instead, we had taken\nfirst steps together, past our knee-jerk reactions to the ubuntu place, which is the only place where solutions to our most\nintractable-seeming problems will be found. So who should you invite to lunch? Next time you catch yourself\nin the act of otherizing, that'll be your clue. And what might happen at your lunch? Will the heavens open and \"We are the World\" play\nover the restaurant sound system? Probably not. Because ubuntu work is slow,\nand it's difficult. It's two people dropping the pretense\nof being know-it-alls. It's two people, two warriors,\ndropping their weapons and reaching toward each other. Here's how the great\nPersian poet Rumi put it: \"Out beyond ideas\nof wrong-doing and right-doing, there is a field. I'll meet you there.\" (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

With it, we can communicate our thoughts\nand feelings, lose ourselves in novels, send text messages, and greet friends. It's hard to imagine being unable\nto turn thoughts into words. But if the delicate web of language\nnetworks in your brain became disrupted by stroke,\nillness, or trauma, you could find yourself truly\nat a loss for words. This disorder, called aphasia,\ncan impair all aspects of communication. People who have aphasia remain\nas intelligent as ever. They know what they want to say, but can't always get their words\nto come out correctly. They may unintentionally use\nsubstitutions called paraphasias, switching related words,\nlike saying \"dog\" for \"cat,\" or words that sound similar,\nsuch as \"house\" for \"horse.\" Sometimes, their words may even be\nunrecognizable. There are several types of aphasia\ngrouped into two categories: fluent, or receptive, aphasia and non-fluent, or expressive, aphasia. People with fluent aphasia may have\nnormal vocal inflection but use words that lack meaning. They have difficulty comprehending\nthe speech of others and are frequently unable to recognize\ntheir own speech errors. People with non-fluent aphasia,\non the other hand, may have good comprehension but will experience long hesitations\nbetween words and make grammatical errors. We all have that tip-of-the-tongue feeling\nfrom time to time when we can't think of a word, but having aphasia can make it hard\nto name simple, everyday objects. Even reading and writing can be difficult\nand frustrating. So how does this language loss happen? The human brain has two hemispheres. In most people, the left hemisphere\ngoverns language. We know this because in 1861, the physician Paul Broca studied a patient who lost the ability to use all \nbut a single word, \"tan.\" During a postmortem study\nof that patient's brain, Broca discovered a large lesion\nin the left hemisphere now known as Broca's area. Scientists today believe that Broca's area\nis responsible in part for naming objects and coordinating the muscles\ninvolved in speech. Behind Broca's area is Wernicke's area\nnear the auditory cortex. That's where the brain attaches\nmeaning to speech sounds. Damage to Wernicke's area impairs the\nbrain's ability to comprehend language. Aphasia is caused by injury to one or\nboth of these specialized language areas. Fortunately, there are other areas\nof the brain which support these language centers and can assist with communication. Even brain areas that control movement\nare connected to language. FMRI studies found that when we hear\naction words, like \"run\" or \"dance,\" parts of the brain responsible\nfor movement light up as if the body was actually running\nor dancing. Our other hemisphere contributes\nto language, too, enhancing the rhythm and intonation\nof our speech. These non-language areas sometimes\nassist people with aphasia when communication is difficult. So how common is aphasia? Approximately 1 million people\nin the U.S. alone have it, with an estimated 80,000 new cases\nper year. About one-third of stroke survivors\nsuffer from aphasia making it more prevalent \nthan Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, yet less widely known. There is one rare form of aphasia called\nprimary progressive aphasia, or PPA, which is not caused by stroke\nor brain injury, but is actually a form of dementia in which language loss \nis the first symptom. The goal in treating PPA is to maintain\nlanguage function for as long as possible before other symptoms of dementia\neventually occur. However, when aphasia is acquired\nfrom a stroke or brain trauma, language improvement may be achieved\nthrough speech therapy. Our brain's ability to repair itself,\nknown as brain plasticity, permits areas surrounding\na brain lesion to take over some functions during\nthe recovery process. Scientists have been conducting\nexperiments using new forms of technology, which they believe may encourage brain\nplasticity in people with aphasia. Meanwhile, many people with aphasia\nremain isolated, afraid that others won't understand\nthem or give them extra time to speak. By offering them the time and flexibility\nto communicate in whatever way they can, you can help open the door \nto language again, moving beyond the limitations of aphasia."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Aphasia affects:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Memory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Intelligence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Language"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both A) and B)"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both B) and C)"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A paraphasia is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The choice of a meaningful word substitution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The mistaken use a word that sounds like, or means something similar to, the intended word"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The inability to comprehend the words of others"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A long series of hesitations between words"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Severe difficulty comprehending language might result if there is damage to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wernicke’s area"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Broca's area"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The motor cortex"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "PPA is a type of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stroke"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Paraphasia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Amnesia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dementia"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Two things that may encourage brain plasticity are:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Brain lesions and dementia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Speech therapy and new experimental technologies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Experiments and hopefulness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Paraphasias and Primary Progressive Aphasia"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

But is wood or charcoal better fuel? Fires are a combustion chemical reaction:\nyou take some fuel, add some heat, and react those molecules with oxygen, then, poof you\nhave a roaring fire. And it’s an exothermic reaction, meaning\nit releases energy in the form of light and heat, the flames you see and feel, and some\nother byproducts. Wood and charcoal are a little different chemically,\nso charcoal releases more heat energy and less smoke when it burns. Wood is made up of long chains of glucose\nmolecules, called cellulose, plus some other structural organic compounds. When those compounds are heated to about 250\ndegrees Celsius, they’ll start to break apart in a process called pyrolysis. These organic molecules break down into simpler\nmolecular components and release volatile gases, which evaporate easily and are combustible. Water, carbon dioxide, and volatile gases\ncombine to create smoke. And the gases reacting with oxygen create\nlots of heat, which causes even more pyrolysis and combustion reactions, and creates more\nflames. If you try to start a fire with damp wood,\nor fresh wood that contains a lot of water, heat will boil the liquid water into vapor,\nwhich isn’t a combustible gas. This basically releases energy into the air,\ninstead of generating more heat. The remaining material from burning wood is\ncalled char or charcoal, which is 70 to 80% pure carbon. And there are some other leftover minerals\nwhich become ashes. Industrial companies can mass produce charcoal\nby heating up wood or wood products without much oxygen. This initiates the pyrolysis step, but doesn’t\nreally cause combustion, since there’s not much oxygen for the volatile gases to react\nwith. So, from a chemical standpoint, charcoal seems\nlike the better fuel source, because it’s mostly carbon, burning it releases more heat\nenergy for a longer period of time, with fewer smoky byproducts. But from an industrial standpoint, there are\nalso big economic issues that come into play. Industrial factories need massive amounts\nof fuel. And since charcoal is a product of wood pyrolysis,\nit’s become a big factor toward deforestation in parts of Africa and South America. So policies and research efforts need to be\ninitiated to conserve these resources, or use them more efficiently. Ultimately, whether you use charcoal for smoke-free\ngrilling, or wood for a big toasty bonfire, use whatever fuel suits your needs to have\na fun and safe summer!

{"page": 36, "lesson": 22, "title": "What is a vector? - David Huynh", "category": "Measurement", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-a-vector-david-huynh", "transcript": {"en": "Physicists, air traffic controllers, and video game creators all have at least one thing in common: vectors. What exactly are they,\nand why do they matter? To answer,\nwe first need to understand scalars. A scalar is a quantity with magnitude. It tells us how much \nof something there is. The distance between you and a bench, and the volume and temperature\nof the beverage in your cup are all described by scalars. Vector quantities also have a magnitude\nplus an extra piece of information, direction. To navigate to your bench, you need to know how far away it is\nand in what direction, not just the distance,\nbut the displacement. What makes vectors special\nand useful in all sorts of fields is that they don't change \nbased on perspective but remain invariant \nto the coordinate system. What does that mean? Let's say you and a friend \nare moving your tent. You stand on opposite sides\nso you're facing in opposite directions. Your friend moves two steps to the right\nand three steps forward while you move two steps to the left\nand three steps back. But even though it seems \nlike you're moving differently, you both end up moving \nthe same distance in the same direction following the same vector. No matter which way you face, or what coordinate system you place\nover the camp ground, the vector doesn't change. Let's use the familiar \nCartesian coordinate system with its x and y axes. We call these two directions\nour coordinate basis because they're used to describe \neverything we graph. Let's say the tent starts at the origin\nand ends up over here at point B. The straight arrow connecting\nthe two points is the vector from the origin to B. When your friend thinks about\nwhere he has to move, it can be written mathematically\nas 2x + 3y, or, like this, which is called an array. Since you're facing the other way, your coordinate basis\npoints in opposite directions, which we can call x prime\nand y prime, and your movement \ncan be written like this, or with this array. If we look at the two arrays,\nthey're clearly not the same, but an array alone doesn't completely\ndescribe a vector. Each needs a basis to give it context, and when we properly assign them, we see that they are in fact\ndescribing the same vector. You can think of elements in the array\nas individual letters. Just as a sequence of letters\nonly becomes a word in the context of a particular language, an array acquires meaning as a vector\nwhen assigned a coordinate basis. And just as different words\nin two languages can convey the same idea, different representations from two bases\ncan describe the same vector. The vector is the essence \nof what's being communicated, regardless of the language \nused to describe it. It turns out that scalars also share\nthis coordinate invariance property. In fact, all quantities with this property\nare members of a group called tensors. Various types of tensors contain different\namounts of information. Does that mean there's something that\ncan convey more information than vectors? Absolutely. Say you're designing a video game, and you want to realistically model\nhow water behaves. Even if you have forces acting\nin the same direction with the same magnitude, depending on how they're oriented,\nyou might see waves or whirls. When force, a vector, is combined with\nanother vector that provides orientation, we have the physical quantity\ncalled stress, which is an example \nof a second order tensor. These tensors are also used outside of\nvideo games for all sorts of purposes, including scientific simulations, car designs, and brain imaging.

You can just hold up fingers. Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK. Now, raise your hand if the question \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" has ever caused you any anxiety. (Laughter) Any anxiety at all. I'm someone who's never\nbeen able to answer the question \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" See, the problem wasn't\nthat I didn't have any interests -- it's that I had too many. In high school, I liked English\nand math and art and I built websites and I played guitar in a punk band\ncalled Frustrated Telephone Operator. Maybe you've heard of us. (Laughter) This continued after high school, and at a certain point, I began\nto notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in, become all-consumed, and I'd get to be pretty good\nat whatever it was, and then I would hit this point\nwhere I'd start to get bored. And usually I would try\nand persist anyway, because I had already devoted\nso much time and energy and sometimes money into this field. But eventually this sense of boredom, this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this,\nthis isn't challenging anymore -- it would get to be too much. And I would have to let it go. But then I would become interested\nin something else, something totally unrelated,\nand I would dive into that, and become all-consumed,\nand I'd be like, \"Yes! I found my thing,\" and then I would hit this point again\nwhere I'd start to get bored. And eventually, I would let it go. But then I would discover\nsomething new and totally different, and I would dive into that. This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons. The first was that I wasn't sure how I was going to turn\nany of this into a career. I thought that I would eventually\nhave to pick one thing, deny all of my other passions, and just resign myself to being bored. The other reason it caused me\nso much anxiety was a little bit more personal. I worried that there\nwas something wrong with this, and something wrong with me\nfor being unable to stick with anything. I worried that I was afraid of commitment, or that I was scattered,\nor that I was self-sabotaging, afraid of my own success. If you can relate to my story\nand to these feelings, I'd like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then. Ask yourself where you learned to assign\nthe meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things. I'll tell you where you learned it: you learned it from the culture. We are first asked the question\n\"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" when we're about five years old. And the truth is that no one really cares\nwhat you say when you're that age. (Laughter) It's considered an innocuous question, posed to little kids\nto elicit cute replies, like, \"I want to be an astronaut,\"\nor \"I want to be a ballerina,\" or \"I want to be a pirate.\" Insert Halloween costume here. (Laughter) But this question gets asked of us\nagain and again as we get older in various forms -- for instance,\nhigh school students might get asked what major they're going\nto pick in college. And at some point, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" goes from being\nthe cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night. Why? See, while this question inspires kids\nto dream about what they could be, it does not inspire them to dream\nabout all that they could be. In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you\nwhat you want to be, you can't reply with 20 different things, though well-meaning adults\nwill likely chuckle and be like, \"Oh, how cute, but you can't be\na violin maker and a psychologist. You have to choose.\" This is Dr. Bob Childs -- (Laughter) and he's a luthier and psychotherapist. And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor\nturned illustrator, entrepreneur, teacher and creative director. But most kids don't hear\nabout people like this. All they hear is that they're going to have to choose. But it's more than that. The notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture. It's this idea of destiny\nor the one true calling, the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do\nduring our time on this earth, and you need to figure out\nwhat that thing is and devote your life to it. But what if you're someone\nwho isn't wired this way? What if there are a lot of different\nsubjects that you're curious about, and many different things you want to do? Well, there is no room for someone\nlike you in this framework. And so you might feel alone. You might feel like you don't\nhave a purpose. And you might feel like\nthere's something wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with you. What you are is a multipotentialite. (Laughter) (Applause) A multipotentialite is someone\nwith many interests and creative pursuits. It's a mouthful to say. It might help if you break it up\ninto three parts: multi, potential, and ite. You can also use one of the other terms\nthat connote the same idea, such as polymath, the Renaissance person. Actually, during the Renaissance period, it was considered the ideal\nto be well-versed in multiple disciplines. Barbara Sher refers to us as \"scanners.\" Use whichever term you like,\nor invent your own. I have to say I find it sort of fitting\nthat as a community, we cannot agree on a single identity. (Laughter) It's easy to see your multipotentiality as a limitation or an affliction\nthat you need to overcome. But what I've learned\nthrough speaking with people and writing about these\nideas on my website, is that there are some tremendous\nstrengths to being this way. Here are three multipotentialite super powers. One: idea synthesis. That is, combining two or more fields and creating something new\nat the intersection. Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew\nfrom their shared interests in cartography, data visualization,\ntravel, mathematics and design, when they founded Meshu. Meshu is a company that creates\ncustom geographically-inspired jewelry. Sha and Rachel came up\nwith this unique idea not despite, but because of their eclectic\nmix of skills and experiences. Innovation happens at the intersections. That's where the new ideas come from. And multipotentialites,\nwith all of their backgrounds, are able to access a lot of these\npoints of intersection. The second multipotentialite superpower is rapid learning. When multipotentialites\nbecome interested in something, we go hard. We observe everything\nwe can get our hands on. We're also used to being beginners, because we've been beginners\nso many times in the past, and this means that we're less afraid\nof trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones. What's more, many skills\nare transferable across disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned\nto every new area we pursue, so we're rarely starting from scratch. Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler\nand freelance writer. As a child concert pianist,\nshe honed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory. Now, she's the fastest typist she knows. (Laughter) Before becoming a writer,\nNora was a financial planner. She had to learn\nthe finer mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice, and this skill now helps her\nwrite compelling pitches to editors. It is rarely a waste of time\nto pursue something you're drawn to, even if you end up quitting. You might apply that knowledge\nin a different field entirely, in a way that you couldn't\nhave anticipated. The third multipotentialite superpower is adaptability; that is, the ability to morph\ninto whatever you need to be in a given situation. Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director,\nsometimes a web designer, sometimes a Kickstarter consultant,\nsometimes a teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James Bond. (Laughter) He's valuable because he does good work. He's even more valuable\nbecause he can take on various roles, depending on his clients' needs. Fast Company magazine\nidentified adaptability as the single most important skill\nto develop in order to thrive in the 21st century. The economic world is changing\nso quickly and unpredictably that it is the individuals\nand organizations that can pivot in order to meet the needs of the market\nthat are really going to thrive. Idea synthesis, rapid learning\nand adaptability: three skills that multipotentialites\nare very adept at, and three skills that they might lose\nif pressured to narrow their focus. As a society, we have a vested interest\nin encouraging multipotentialites to be themselves. We have a lot of complex, multidimensional\nproblems in the world right now, and we need creative,\nout-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them. Now, let's say that you are,\nin your heart, a specialist. You came out of the womb knowing\nyou wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon. Don't worry -- there's nothing\nwrong with you, either. (Laughter) In fact, some of the best teams\nare comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together. The specialist can dive in deep\nand implement ideas, while the multipotentialite brings\na breadth of knowledge to the project. It's a beautiful partnership. But we should all be designing\nlives and careers that are aligned with how we're wired. And sadly, multipotentialites\nare largely being encouraged simply to be more\nlike their specialist peers. So with that said, if there is one thing\nyou take away from this talk, I hope that it is this: embrace your inner wiring,\nwhatever that may be. If you're a specialist at heart, then by all means, specialize. That is where you'll do your best work. But to the multipotentialites in the room, including those of you\nwho may have just realized in the last 12 minutes that you are one -- (Laughter) to you I say: embrace your many passions. Follow your curiosity\ndown those rabbit holes. Explore your intersections. Embracing our inner wiring leads\nto a happier, more authentic life. And perhaps more importantly -- multipotentialites, the world needs us. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
