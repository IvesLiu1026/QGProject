So take this forested hillside\nin Northern Manhattan, for example. This is one of the last areas\nleft in the city where there's clean spring water\nseeping out of the ground. You could drink this\nout of your hands and you'd be OK. These tiny little areas of seeping water contain huge populations\nof northern dusky salamanders. These guys were common in the city\nmaybe 60 years ago, but now they're just stuck\non this single hillside and a few places in Staten Island. Not only do they suffer the indignity\nof being stuck on this hillside, but we divided the hillside in two on two different occasions with bridges crossing\nfrom the Bronx into Manhattan. But they're still there,\non either side of the bridges, where you see the red arrows --\nabout 180th Street, 167th Street. My lab has found that if you just take\na few segments of DNA from salamanders in those two locations, you can tell which side\nof the bridge they came from. We built this single piece\nof infrastructure that's changed their evolutionary history. We can go study these guys,\nwe just go to the hillside we know where they are,\nwe flip over rocks so we can catch them. There are a lot of other things\nin New York City, though, that are not that easy to capture,\nsuch as this guy, a coyote. We caught him on an automatic camera trap\nin an undisclosed location; I'm not allowed to talk about it yet. But they're moving into New York City\nfor the first time. They're very flexible,\nintelligent animals. This is one of this year's pups\nchecking out one of our cameras. And my colleagues and I\nare very interested in understanding how they're going to spread\nthrough the area, how they're going to survive here\nand maybe even thrive. And they're probably coming\nto a neighborhood near you, if they're not already there. Some things are too fast\nto be caught by hand. We can't pick them up on the cameras, so we set up traps\naround New York City and the parks. This is one of our most common activities. Here's some of my students\nand collaborators getting the traps out and ready. This guy, we catch in almost\nevery forested area in New York City. This is the white-footed mouse -- not the mouse you find\nrunning around your apartment. This is a native species,\nbeen here long before humans. You find them in forests and meadows. Because they're so common\nin forested areas in the city, we're using them as a model\nto understand how species are adapting to urban environments. So if you think back 400 years ago, the five boroughs would've been covered\nin forests and other types of vegetation. This mouse would've been everywhere\n[in] huge populations that showed few genetic differences\nacross the landscape. But if you look at the situation today, they're just stuck in these little islands\nof forest scattered around the city. Just using 18 short segments of DNA,\nwe can pretty much take a mouse somebody could give us a mouse,\nnot tell us where it was from, and we could determine\nwhat park it came from. That's how different they've become. You'll notice in the middle\nof this figure, there are some mixed-up colors. There are a few parks in the city\nthat are still connected to each other with strips of forest,\nso the mice can run back and forth and spread their genes,\nso they don't become different. But throughout the city, they're mostly\nbecoming different in the parks. So I'm telling you they're different,\nbut what does that mean? What's changing about their biology? To answer this question, we're sequencing thousands\nof genes from our city mice and comparing those to thousands\nof genes from the country mice, so, their ancestors\noutside of New York City in these big, more wilderness areas. Now, genes are short segments of DNA\nthat code for amino acids. And amino acids are\nthe building blocks of proteins. If a single base pair changes in a gene, you can get a different amino acid, which will then change the shape\nand structure of the protein. If you change the structure of a protein, you often change something\nabout what it does in the organism. Now if that change leads to a longer\nlife or more babies for a mouse, something evolutionary\nbiologists call fitness, then that single base-pair change\nwill spread quickly in an urban population. So this crazy figure\nis called a Manhattan plot, because it kind of looks like a skyline. Each dot represents one gene, and the higher the dot is in the plot, the more different it is\nbetween city and country mice. The ones kind of at the tips\nof the skyscrapers are the most different, especially those above the red line. And these genes encode for things\nlike immune response to disease, because there might be more disease\nin very dense, urban populations; metabolism, how the mice use energy; and heavy-metal tolerance. You guys can probably predict that New York City soils\nare pretty contaminated with lead and chromium\nand that sort of thing. And now our hard work is really starting. We're going back into the wilds\nof New York City parks, following the lives of individual mice and seeing exactly\nwhat these genes are doing for them. And I would encourage you guys\nto try to look at your parks in a new way. I'm not going to be\nthe next Charles Darwin, but one of you guys might be,\nso just keep your eyes open. Thank you.

Check out the supermarket -- orange\njuice from China, nuts from India, swordfish from Japan,\nlagers from Czechoslovakia, scores of European cheeses. You name it, it's there.\nNot when I was growing up. You'd never taste a range\nof French cheeses or Bohemian lager beer. At least, you couldn't\nunless you were very rich and could go anywhere when the fancy\ntook you. All that has changed. But it's not just foods. Got an iPhone? Everyone knows it was invented\nand designed at Cupertino in California, but who knows where the complex bits and pieces of its\ninnards are made or assembled? Apple doesn't say. The industry credits China,\nJapan, Germany, South Korea and, of course, the United States itself. Just think for a moment\nof the trillions of parts and finished goods moving\ncheaply around the world every second, a small portion by air, but most by sea. We call it globalization, but the man who basically made\nglobalization a reality in our lives is too little known. This is his story. The story of the man who makes your day. In the Great Depression of the '30s, when millions of Americans were\nout of work, worse than now, Malcolm McLean was a 24-year-old\ntruck driver. He got a job to take cotton bales from Fayetteville in North\nCarolina all the way to a pier in Hoboken, New\nJersey for shipping overseas. He was glad of the work,\nbut when he arrived he got bored out of his mind,\nsitting in his truck waiting and waiting\nand waiting on the docks as the worker ants muscled crates\nand bundles off other trucks and into slings that lifted the goods\ninto the hold of the ship. On board the ship itself, with much yelling and arm waving, the stevedores then unloaded each sling and saw its contents placed\nin a designated position in the hold. Malcolm wasn't just bored, he was fuming. His income depended on getting\nback to North Carolina to pick up more loads in his truck. Out of the frustration,\ninspiration struck. Wouldn't it be great, he thought, if my trailer could be lifted and placed on the ship without its cotton bales being touched.\nYes, it would be great. It would be revolutionary. For centuries, general non-bulk cargo had been shipped\nin the process he watched. It was called break bulk shipping. Boxes, bales, crates\nhandled piece by piece. What Malcolm envisaged\nwould have saved him only a day, but it would have saved everyone else something like two weeks\nin loading and unloading the ship. On average, it was eight days to haul and distribute break\nbulk shipments in the hold, plus another eight days at the other end to retrieve and distribute. All that time would have been saved if Malcolm McLean could have just\ndriven his truck onto the ship and at the other end, driven it off. Well, today that concept is a reality. The concept that occurred to Malcolm is known as containerization. It has done more than just\nsave a great deal of time. It's the reason why we have\na thriving global marketplace, offering us that infinite\nvariety of things, and it's the reason we can move cargo from remote parts\nof the world at minimal cost. Malcolm had his idea in 1937. The 24-year-old truck driver\nsitting in his truck in Hoboken was 40 before he did anything about it. By then, he'd built his one truck into a big trucking company.\nHe borrowed money from an enterprising vice president\nat Citibank in New York, and set about designing the steel\nboxes and the decks of the ships to carry them stacked\none on top of another. A lot of people thought he was crazy. Inventors always attract\narmies of naysayers who can never remember\nhow critical they were. For our part, we should\nremember Malcolm McLean. His first container ship, the Ideal X, sailed from Shed 154 at Marsh Street, Port Newark with 58 well-filled boxes. It was the beginning of the container era, shrinking our world and enlarging human choice."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "It’s easy to see globalization at the grocery store.

It's a fancy term for a partnership\nbetween two different species, such as bees and flowers. In a symbiosis, both species\ndepend on each other. I want to tell you\nabout a remarkable symbiosis between a little bird,\nthe Clark's nutcracker, and a big tree, the whitebark pine. Whitebark grow in the mountains\nof Wyoming, Montana and other western states. They have huge canopies\nand lots of needles, which provide cover and shelter\nfor other plants and animals, and whitebark feed the forest. Their cones are packed with protein. Squirrels gnaw the cones\nfrom the upper branches so they fall to the ground, and then race down to bury them\nin piles, or middens. But they don't get to keep all of them; grizzlies and black bears\nlove finding middens. But there's more to a symbiosis\nthan one species feeding another. In the case of the Clark's nutcracker,\nthis bird gives back. While gathering its seeds,\nit also replants the trees. Here's how it works:\nusing her powerful beak, the nutcracker picks apart\na cone in a treetop, pulling out the seeds. She can store up to 80 of them\nin a pouch in her throat. Then she flies through the forest looking for a place to cache the seeds an inch under the soil\nin piles of up to eight seeds. Nutcrackers can gather\nup to 90,000 seeds in the autumn, which they return for\nin the winter and spring. And these birds are smart. They remember where all those seeds are. They even use landmarks\non the landscape -- trees, stumps, rocks -- to triangulate to caches\nburied deep under the snow. What they don't go back and get,\nthose seeds become whitebark. This symbiosis is\nso important to both species that they've changed,\nor evolved, to suit each other. Nutcrackers have developed\nlong, tough beaks for extracting seeds from cones, and whitebarks' branches all sweep upwards with the cones at the very ends, so they can offer them\nto the nutcrackers as they fly by.

There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes, so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand, just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand. And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches to represent the stars in the overall universe. Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles. Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars. But he and other physicists now believe in a reality that is unimaginably bigger still. I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes are probably a minuscule fraction of the total. Space itself is expanding at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies are separating from us so fast that light from them may never reach us. Still, our physical reality here on Earth is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies. We can think of them as part of our universe. They make up a single, giant edifice, obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me. However, recent theories in physics, including one called string theory, are now telling us there could be countless other universes, built on different types of particles, with different properties, obeying different laws. Most of these universes could never support life, and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond, but nonetheless, combined they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes. in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination. And the leading version of string theory predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes. That's a one followed by 500 zeroes, a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe had its own universe and all of the atoms in all of those universes each had their own universe, and you repeated that for two more cycles, you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total -- namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth. But even that number is minuscule compared to another number: infinity. Some physicists think the space-time continuum is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number of so-called pocket universes with varying properties. How's your brain doing? But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle. I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt, but interpreting it is baffling. And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes are being spawned every moment, and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in, would include multiple copies of you. In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams. In another, not so much. There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash. The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one, only one universe. And a few philosophers and mystics might argue that even our own universe is an illusion. So, as you can see, right now there is no agreement on this question, not even close. All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity. Well, I guess we know one other thing: This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics. We just might be undergoing the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately how many planet Earths could you fit inside the sun?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nine hundred"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A million"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nine million"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If a star was the size of a single grain of sand, the number of stars in the Milky Way would ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fill an entire glass (like a glass of milk)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Look like the Crab Nebulae"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Create a beach about 30 ft by 30 ft in size"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Be more than all the sand on all the beaches on Earth"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Approximately how many galaxies are there in our own universe?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "There's only one, the Milky Way."}, {"label": "B", "text": "30 billion, give or take 20%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100 billion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Perhaps vastly more than 100 billion, but light from many of them may never reach us."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "If every atom in our observable universe (which is estimated to have 10^80 atoms) had its own universe (like ours), and all the atoms in all those universes each had ITS own universe, and all the atoms in all THOSE universes had its own universe, how many universes would that be altogether?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An infinite number"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Far more than is predicted by any theory"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A tiny fraction of what some versions of string theory predict"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It's a meaningless question"}, {"label": "E", "text": "My brain just melted"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When scientists refer to a reality made up of many universes, what do they call it?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Holy Stephen Hawking"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The super-brain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The multiverse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The algorithm"}, {"label": "E", "text": "The quantum field"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 77, "lesson": 7, "title": "How simple ideas lead to scientific discoveries - Adam Savage", "category": "Nature of Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-simple-ideas-lead-to-scientific-discoveries", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Jenny Zurawell One of the funny things\nabout owning a brain is that you have\nno control over the things that it gathers and holds onto,\nthe facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand\nwhy you're interested in them, before you understand their import to you. Here's three of mine. When Richard Feynman\nwas a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad\nand his wagon and a ball. He noticed that when he pulled the wagon,\nthe ball went to the back of the wagon. He asked his dad, \"Why does\nthe ball go to the back of the wagon?\" And his dad said, \"That's inertia.\" He said, \"What's inertia?\"\nAnd his dad said, \"Ah. Inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball\ngoing to the back of the wagon.\" (Laughter) \"But in truth, nobody really knows.\" Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton, he solved\nthe Challenger disaster, he ended up winning\nthe Nobel Prize in Physics for his Feynman diagrams, describing\nthe movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation\nwith his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry\nyou out to the edge of human knowledge, and that that's where he wanted to play. And play he did. Eratosthenes was the third librarian\nat the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science. But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received\nas the librarian, from the town of Swenet,\nwhich was south of Alexandria. The letter included this fact\nthat stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice,\nwhen he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see\nthat his head was blocking the sun. I should tell you -- the idea\nthat Christopher Columbus discovered that the world\nis spherical is total bull. It's not true at all. In fact, everyone who was educated\nunderstood that the world was spherical since Aristotle's time. Aristotle had proved it\nwith a simple observation. He noticed that every time you saw\nthe Earth's shadow on the Moon, it was circular, and the only shape that constantly\ncreates a circular shadow is a sphere, Q.E.D. the Earth is round. But nobody knew how big it was until Eratosthenes got\nthis letter with this fact. So he understood that the sun\nwas directly above the city of Swenet, because looking down a well,\nit was a straight line all the way down the well,\nright past the guy's head up to the sun. Eratosthenes knew another fact. He knew that a stick stuck\nin the ground in Alexandria at the same time\nand the same day, at noon, the sun's zenith, on the solstice, the sun cast a shadow that showed\nthat it was 7.2 degrees off-axis. If you know the circumference of a circle,\nand you have two points on it, all you need to know is the distance\nbetween those two points, and you can extrapolate the circumference. 360 degrees divided by 7.2 equals 50. I know it's a little bit\nof a round number, and it makes me suspicious\nof this story too, but it's a good story,\nso we'll continue with it. He needed to know the distance\nbetween Swenet and Alexandria, which is good because Eratosthenes\nwas good at geography. In fact, he invented the word geography. (Laughter) The road between Swenet and Alexandria\nwas a road of commerce, and commerce needed to know\nhow long it took to get there. It needed to know the exact distance,\nso he knew very precisely that the distance between\nthe two cities was 500 miles. Multiply that times 50, you get 25,000, which is within one percent\nof the actual diameter of the Earth. He did this 2,200 years ago. Now, we live in an age where multi-billion-dollar pieces of machinery\nare looking for the Higgs boson. We're discovering particles that may travel faster\nthan the speed of light, and all of these discoveries\nare made possible by technology that's been developed\nin the last few decades. But for most of human history, we had to discover these things using\nour eyes and our ears and our minds. Armand Fizeau was\nan experimental physicist in Paris. His specialty was actually refining\nand confirming other people's results, and this might sound\nlike a bit of an also-ran, but in fact, this is the soul of science, because there is no such thing as a fact\nthat cannot be independently corroborated. And he was familiar\nwith Galileo's experiments in trying to determine\nwhether or not light had a speed. Galileo had worked out this\nreally wonderful experiment where he and his assistant had a lamp,\neach one of them was holding a lamp. Galileo would open his lamp,\nand his assistant would open his. They got the timing down really good. They just knew their timing. And then they stood at two hilltops, two miles distant,\nand they did the same thing, on the assumption from Galileo\nthat if light had a discernible speed, he'd notice a delay in the light\ncoming back from his assistant's lamp. But light was too fast for Galileo. He was off by several orders\nof magnitude when he assumed that light was roughly ten times\nas fast as the speed of sound. Fizeau was aware of this experiment. He lived in Paris, and he set up\ntwo experimental stations, roughly 5.5 miles distant, in Paris. And he solved this problem of Galileo's, and he did it with a really relatively\ntrivial piece of equipment. He did it with one of these. I'm going to put away\nthe clicker for a second because I want to engage\nyour brains in this. So this is a toothed wheel. It's got a bunch of notches\nand it's got a bunch of teeth. This was Fizeau's solution\nto sending discrete pulses of light. He put a beam behind one of these notches. If I point a beam\nthrough this notch at a mirror, five miles away, that beam\nis bouncing off the mirror and coming back to me through this notch. But something interesting happens\nas he spins the wheel faster. He notices that it seems\nlike a door is starting to close on the light beam\nthat's coming back to his eye. Why is that? It's because the pulse\nof light is not coming back through the same notch. It's actually hitting a tooth. And he spins the wheel fast enough\nand he fully occludes the light. And then, based on the distance\nbetween the two stations and the speed of his wheel\nand the number of notches in the wheel, he calculates the speed of light\nto within two percent of its actual value. And he does this in 1849. This is what really gets me\ngoing about science. Whenever I'm having trouble\nunderstanding a concept, I go back and I research\nthe people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how\nthey came to understand it. What happens when you look at what the discoverers\nwere thinking about when they made their discoveries, is you understand that\nthey are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water.\nWe all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches\nof science are called fields of study. Most people think of science\nas a closed, black box, when in fact it is an open field. And we are all explorers. The people that made these discoveries\njust thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at,\nand they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way\npeople thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you.
