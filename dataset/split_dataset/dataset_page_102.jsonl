Or perhaps more simply, trains, planes, and automobiles. Which one is most important, the best, or the greatest? Which one has had the most impact on society? Today the debate would probably be in favor of computer technology, but is it? Well, some would say, \"Nope, not really, it's farming.\" Where would we be if we didn't have it? Give up? We would still be hunting and gathering with little time to invent anything, let alone the Internet. That's right, farming is the seed of civilization. Not quite literally, but without early man's discovery of using seeds to grow grain, we wouldn't have much of anything we have today. Growing your own food changed everything. Sure, hunting and gathering worked just fine for tens of thousands of years, but you couldn't do much else - no time. But when hunters and gatherers started planting seeds, they began to farm. With farming came animals, and with animals came settling down and staying in one location. So, how does this have anything to do with invention and innovation? Everything. Anyone who's ever farmed, even if it's planting a half dozen tomato plants in your backyard, knows that you usually harvest way more than you could possibly eat, a surplus. Farming yielded plenty of food, with enough to store, trade, and eat. In other words, not everyone needed to be farmers. Therefore, this allowed other people, non-farmers, to do other things such as make tools, craft pottery, and build homes. Farming and food surpluses led to the division of labor. This is still thousands of years ago, so life wasn't easy. But with so many people contributing to the community, small villages began to develop. As the population of villages expanded, so did the needs of the people. Things got complicated. But, civilization is just that - advanced, complex societies. And without farming, they would not exist. Villages increased in size, eventually becoming the first cities. Cities are just one of the basic features of a civilization, the others include central government, system of writing, organized religion, art and architecture, urban planning of roads, bridges, and public works, social classes, and different jobs. Developing expertise in various types of occupations allowed for innovative ways of doing things, producing new products, or making advancements in technology. As civilizations became more complex, new ways of doing things were needed. Some were out of necessity. Others because people had ideas. The sharing of ideas and technology led to the growth of things we readily use today, like the Internet. So without farming, we'd still be hunting and gathering.

But the story is far more complicated, filled with imperial intrigue, corporate crisis, smuggling, and the grassroots origins of the American Revolution. The first thing you need to know about tea in the 1700's is that it was really, really popular. In England, each man, woman, and child consumed almost 300 cups of this stuff every year. And, since the English colonized America, Americans were crazy about tea too. By the 1760's, they were drinking over a million pounds of tea every year. So, when Britain wanted to increase taxes on tea in America, people were not happy, mostly because they had no say in tax decisions made in London. Remember that famous phrase, \"No taxation without representation\"? The American colonists had long believed that they were not subject to taxes imposed by legislature in which they lacked representation. In fact, rather than paying the taxes, they simply dodged the tax collectors. Since the east coast of America is hundreds of miles long and British enforcement was lax, about 3/4 of the tea Americans were drinking was smuggled in, usually from Holland. But the British insisted that Parliament did have the authority to tax the colonists, especially after Britain went deeply into debt fighting the French in the Seven Years' War. To close the budget gap, London looked to Americans, and in 1767 imposed new taxes on a variety of imports, including the American's beloved tea. America's response: no thanks! They boycotted the importation of tea from Britain, and instead, brewed their own. After a new bunch of British customs commissioners cried to London for troops to help with tax enforcement, things got so heated that the Red Coats fired on a mob in Boston, killing several people, in what was soon called the Boston Massacre. Out of the terms of the 1773 Tea Act, Parliament cooked up a new strategy. Now the East India Company would sell the surplus tea directly through hand-picked consignees in America. This would lower the price to consumers, making British tea competitive with the smuggled variety while retaining some of the taxes. But the colonists saw through the British ploy and cried, \"Monopoly!\" Now it's a cold and rainy December 16, 1773. About 5,000 Bostonians are crowded into the Old South Meeting House, waiting to hear whether new shipments of tea that have arrived down the harbor will be unloaded for sale. When the captain of one of those ships reported that he could not leave with his cargo on board, Sam Adams rose to shout, \"This meeting can do no more to save the country!\" Cries of \"Boston Harbor a teapot tonight!\" rang out from the crowd, and about 50 men, some apparently dressed as Native Americans, marched down to Griffin's Wharf, stormed aboard three ships, and threw 340 tea chests overboard. An infuriated British government responsded with the so-called Coercive Acts of 1774, which, among other things, closed the port of Boston until the locals compensated the East India Company for the tea. That never happened. Representatives of the colonies gathered at Philadelphia to consider how best to respond to continued British oppression. This first Continental Congress supported destruction of the tea, pledged to support a continued boycott, and went home in late October 1774 even more united in their determination to protect their rights and liberties. The Boston Tea Party began a chain reaction that led with little pause to the Declaration of Independence and a bloody rebellion, after which the new nation was free to drink its tea, more or less, in peace."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why did Parliament impose new taxes on the American colonists after the mid-1700s?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "British officials wanted revenue to purchase land in North America from France"}, {"label": "B", "text": "British officials wanted to punish the colonists for leaving England"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The colonists had willingly paid taxes imposed by Parliament in the past"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The British owed money to Bulgaria and Spain"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How did the colonists respond to these new taxes?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "After King George threatened the use of force, they reluctantly paid the taxes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They boycotted the importation of goods from Britain that were subject to the new taxes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They sought an alliance with France"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Many colonists simply returned to Britain"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Colonial leaders, including George Washington, travelled to London to protest imperial policy"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The 1773 Tea Act was designed to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Help the East India Company sell surplus tea"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lure the American colonists into buying taxed tea"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Repeal all taxes on the colonists, including the one on imported tea"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both A and B"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both A and C"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In response to the Tea Act, Bostonians", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gathered at Old South Meeting House to consider their options"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Attacked British troops stationed in Boston in what came to be known as the Boston Massacre"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Called on New Yorkers for help"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Simply ignored the new law and went about business as usual."}, {"label": "E", "text": "Decided it was time to support a Declaration of Independence from Britain"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The colonists responded to the so-called Coercive Acts by", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Meeting in Philadelphia where they agreed to continued boycotts of imports from Britain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Agreeing to pay for the tea destroyed in Boston"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Immediately declaring independence from Britain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Asking the British government to send additional troops to enforce the law"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Seeking financial assistance from the Spanish government"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But the key to Communist victory wasn't weapons or stamina, it was a dirt road. The Ho Chi Minh Trail, winding through Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, started as a simple network of dirt roads and blossomed into the centerpiece of the winning North Vietnamese strategy during the Vietnam War, supplying weapons, troops, and psychological support to the South. The trail was a network of tracks, dirt roads, and river crossings that threaded west out of North Vietnam and south along the Truong Son Mountain Range between Vietnam and Laos. The journey to the South originally took six months. But, with engineering and ingenuity, the Vietnamese expanded and improved the trail. Towards the end of war, as the main roads detoured through Laos, it only took one week. Here is how it happened. In 1959, as relations deteriorated between the North and the South, a system of trails was constructed in order to infiltrate soldiers, weapons, and supplies into South Vietnam. The first troops moved in single-file along routes used by local ethnic groups, and broken tree branches at dusty crossroads were often all that indicated the direction. Initially, most of the Communist cadres who came down the trail were Southerners by birth who had trained in North Vietnam. They dressed like civilian peasants in black, silk pajamas with a checkered scarf. They wore Ho Chi Minh sandals on their feet, cut from truck tires, and carried their ration of cooked rice in elephants' intestines, a linen tube hung around the body. The conditions were harsh and many deaths were caused by exposure, malaria, and amoebic dysentery. Getting lost, starving to death, and the possibility of attacks by wild tigers or bears were constant threats. Meals were invariably just rice and salt, and it was easy to run out. Fear, boredom, and homesickness were the dominant emotions. And soldiers occupied their spare time by writing letters, drawing sketches, and drinking and smoking with local villagers. The first troops down the trail did not engage in much fighting. And after an exhausting six month trip, arriving in the South was a real highlight, often celebrated by bursting into song. By 1965, the trip down the trail could be made by truck. Thousands of trucks supplied by China and Russia took up the task amidst ferocious B-52 bombing and truck drivers became known as pilots of the ground. As traffic down the trail increased, so did the U.S. bombing. They drove at night or in the early morning to avoid air strikes, and watchmen were ready to warn drivers of enemy aircraft. Villages along the trail organized teams to guarantee traffic flow and to help drivers repair damage caused by air attacks. Their catch cries were, \"Everything for our Southern brothers!\" and, \"We will not worry about our houses if the vehicles have not yet gotten through.\" Some families donated their doors and wooden beds to repair roads. Vietnamese forces even used deception to get the U.S. aircraft to bomb mountainsides in order to make gravel for use in building and maintaining roads. The all-pervading red dust seeped into every nook and cranny. The Ho Chi Minh Trail had a profound impact on the Vietnam War and it was the key to Hanoi's success. North Vietnamese victory was not determined by the battlefields, but by the trail, which was the political, strategic, and economic lynchpin. Americans recognized its achievement, calling the trail, \"One of the great achievements in military engineering of the 20th century.\" The trail is a testimony to the strength of will of the Vietnamese people, and the men and women who used the trail have become folk heros."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Ho Chi Minh Trail passed through all but which of these countries?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vietnam"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Thailand"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Laos"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cambodia"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The journey on the trail to South Vietnam originally took how many months?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Two"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Six"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ten"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fourteen"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Initially, most of the people that used the trail were southerners by birth that were trained in the north.

Awesome job! You're a tremendous athlete! Compliments, right? Well, maybe. Depending on the attitude and tone of voice behind these lines, they very well may be compliments. They may also be, though, pointed and attacking lines. This slight change of attitude behind the lines reveals what we call verbal irony. So when someone says, \"Great weather we're having,\" it is quite possible that the person really means that if the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the wind is calm. But if the weather is horrible, the clouds are looming, and the wind is a raging tempest, and someone says, \"Great weather we're having,\" he probably doesn't actually mean that. He probably means that the weather is horrible, but he has said the opposite. This is verbal irony when the speaker says the opposite of what he means. I know what you're thinking. Isn't this sarcasm, isn't the speaker being sarcastic? Yes. When a speaker says the opposite of what he means, that is verbal irony. When a speaker then goes the step farther to mean the opposite of what he says and seeks to be a little pointed and mean, like he's making fun of something, then you have sarcasm. Take the second example: \"Awesome job!\" Someone accomplishing his life-long dream: awesome! Someone winning a sports championship: awesome! Someone rear-ends another car: not awesome. So when the passenger says, \"Awesome job!\" they probably mean the opposite with a hint of poking fun. That is verbal irony and that is sarcastic. \"You're a talented athlete,\" said to an Olympian: authentic, no verbal irony present. Said to the klutzy kid tripping into English class and spilling his books and pencil case all over the room, now that is just harsh and verbally ironic because what you said is not what you meant. That is verbal irony. You have said the opposite of what you mean. Additionally, since you have the intention of mocking this poor person, you have not only been verbally ironic, but sarcastic as well. Beware, though. While all sarcasm fits the definition of verbal irony, not all verbal irony is sarcastic. Verbal irony is where what is meant is the opposite of what is said, while sarcasm adds that little punch of attitude. There are times, though, where another layer of meaning can be present without that sarcastic tone. Alright, now go out there and find those examples of verbal irony and sarcasm. Good luck!

They're able to calculate probabilities\nof having a specific trait or getting a genetic disease according to the information\nfrom the parents and the family history. But how is this possible? To understand how traits pass\nfrom one living being to its descendants, we need to go back in time\nto the 19th century and a man named Gregor Mendel. Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist who loved to work with plants. By breeding the pea plants\nhe was growing in the monastery's garden, he discovered the principles\nthat rule heredity. In one of most classic examples, Mendel combined\na purebred yellow-seeded plant with a purebred green-seeded plant, and he got only yellow seeds. He called the yellow-colored trait\nthe dominant one, because it was expressed\nin all the new seeds. Then he let the new yellow-seeded\nhybrid plants self-fertilize. And in this second generation,\nhe got both yellow and green seeds, which meant the green trait\nhad been hidden by the dominant yellow. He called this hidden trait\nthe recessive trait. From those results, Mendel inferred that each trait depends\non a pair of factors, one of them coming from the mother and the other from the father. Now we know that these factors\nare called alleles and represent the different\nvariations of a gene. Depending on which type of allele\nMendel found in each seed, we can have what we call a homozygous pea,\nwhere both alleles are identical, and what we call a heterozygous pea, when the two alleles are different. This combination of alleles\nis known as genotype and its result, being yellow or green, is called phenotype. To clearly visualize how alleles\nare distributed amongst descendants, we can a diagram\ncalled the Punnett square. You place the different\nalleles on both axes and then figure out\nthe possible combinations. Let's look at Mendel's peas, for example. Let's write the dominant yellow allele\nas an uppercase \"Y\" and the recessive green allele\nas a lowercase \"y.\" The uppercase Y always\noverpowers his lowercase friend, so the only time you get green babies is if you have lowercase Y's. In Mendel's first generation,\nthe yellow homozygous pea mom will give each pea kid\na yellow-dominant allele, and the green homozygous pea dad\nwill give a green-recessive allele. So all the pea kids\nwill be yellow heterozygous. Then, in the second generation, where the two heterozygous kids marry, their babies could have\nany of the three possible genotypes, showing the two possible phenotypes in a three-to-one proportion. But even peas have\na lot of characteristics. For example, besides\nbeing yellow or green, peas may be round or wrinkled. So we could have all\nthese possible combinations: round yellow peas, round green peas, wrinkled yellow peas, wrinkled green peas. To calculate the proportions\nfor each genotype and phenotype, we can use a Punnett square too. Of course, this will make it\na little more complex. And lots of things are more\ncomplicated than peas, like, say, people. These days, scientists know a lot more\nabout genetics and heredity. And there are many other ways in which\nsome characteristics are inherited. But, it all started\nwith Mendel and his peas."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What did Gregor Mendel use to discover the principles that rule heredity?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pea plants"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pigeons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pear trees"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Photosynthesis"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What happened to the green trait in Mendel's pea plants?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It disappeared, further proving Darwin's theory of evolution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The pea plants produced 50% less green seeds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It was hidden by the dominant yellow gene"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nothing happened to the green gene"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What did Mendel call the two kinds of traits exhibited by the pea plants (one coming from the father, one from the mother)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Genesis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elective traits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Alleles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Quadrants"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What do we call the result of the genotype (for example, the color of the peas)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Visible traits"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Physiotrait"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Genotype 2"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Phenotype"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What do we call the table used to calculate the probability of an offspring's genotype?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Punnett square"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Venn diagram"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Golden ratio"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fibonacci sequence"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 102, "lesson": 7, "title": "The difference between classical and operant conditioning - Peggy Andover", "category": "History, Approaches and Methods", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-difference-between-classical-and-operant-conditioning-peggy-andover", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Andrea McDonough\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we think about learning, we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall, books open on their desks, listening intently to a teacher or professor in the front of the room. But in psychology, learning means something else. To psychologists, learning is a long-term change in behavior that's based on experience. Two of the main types of learning are called classical conditioning and operant, or instrumental, conditioning. Let's talk about classical conditioning first. In the 1890's, a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov did some really famous experiments on dogs. He showed dogs some food and rang a bell at the same time. After a while, the dogs would associate the bell with the food. They would learn that when they heard the bell, they would get fed. Eventually, just ringing the bell made the dogs salivate. They learned to expect food at the sound of a bell. You see, under normal conditions, the sight and smell of food causes a dog to salivate. We call the food an unconditioned stimulus, and we call salivation the unconditioned response. Nobody trains a dog to salivate over some steak. However, when we pair an unconditioned stimulus like food with something that was previously neutral, like the sound of a bell, that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus. And so classical conditioning was discovered. We see how this works with animals, but how does it work with humans? In exactly the same way. Let's say that one day you go to the doctor to get a shot. She says, \"Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit,\" and then gives you the most painful shot you've ever had. A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up. He starts to put a mirror in your mouth to examine your teeth, and he says, \"Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit.\" Even though you know the mirror won't hurt, you jump out of the chair and run, screaming from the room. When you went to get a shot, the words, \"This won't hurt a bit,\" became a conditioned stimulus when they were paired with pain of the shot, the unconditioned stimulus, which was followed by your conditioned response of getting the heck out of there. Classical conditioning in action. Operant conditioning explains how consequences lead to changes in voluntary behavior. So how does operant conditioning work? There are two main components in operant conditioning: reinforcement and punishment. Reinforcers make it more likely that you'll do something again, while punishers make it less likely. Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative, but this doesn't mean good and bad. Positive means the addition of a stimulus, like getting dessert after you finish your veggies, and negative means the removal of a stimulus, like getting a night of no homework because you did well on an exam. Let's look at an example of operant conditioning. After eating dinner with your family, you clear the table and wash the dishes. When you're done, your mom gives you a big hug and says, \"Thank you for helping me.\" In this situation, your mom's response is positive reinforcement if it makes you more likely to repeat the operant response, which is to clear the table and wash the dishes. Operant conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives. There aren't many things we do that haven't been influenced at some point by operant conditioning. We even see operant conditioning in some extraordinary situations. One group of scientists showed the power of operant conditioning by teaching pigeons to be art connoisseurs. Using food as a positive reinforcer, scientists have taught pigeons to select paintings by Monet over those by Picasso. When showed works of other artists, scientists observed stimulus generalization as the pigeons chose the Impressionists over the Cubists.

Well, about 60% of the food you eat is carbohydrates. As you can probably tell from its name, carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But where do these atoms originally come from and how do they join together to make delicious foods like fruits and pasta? It actually all starts with the air you are exhaling this very minute, specifically the carbon dioxide molecules. Plants are going to breath in this very same carbon dioxide through pores in their skin, called stomata. Plants drink in water from their roots to get the needed oxygen and hydrogen atoms, and their electrons, in order to build carbohydrates. What is that thing? Well, that's a special plant organelle inside the leaves of plants called a chloroplast. It's green beceause of a special light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll. Each leaf has about 44,000 cells and every cell can have anywhere between 20 to 100 chloroplasts. That's up to 4,400,000 chloroplasts! By now, you've probably guessed that we're talking about the process of photosynthesis and you might be wondering when the sun is going to make its entrance. Let's go back to that original molecule of water. The plant has to split this molecule of water so it can get electrons from it. But, the plant can't pull that water apart by itself. It needs help from the high-energy rays of the sun. So now that the chloroplast has all the building blocks - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons - it can use them to go through the rest of the steps of photosynthesis to transform that original carbon dioxide gas into a simple carbohydrate called glucose, C-6-H-12-O-6. That little glucose molecule then helps to build bigger and better carbohydrates like cellulose. Cellulose is a type of carbohydrate found in plants that our body cannot break down. We call it fiber and we eat it in vegetables like lettuce, broccoli, and celery. Plants use cellulose to keep themselves strong. The plant could also turn that glucose into starch, a large molecule that stores energy for the plant. We love eating starch from plants like potatoes, corn, and rice. So you see, when you eat plants, we're actually benefiting from photosynthesis. The plant makes things like starch, which we eat and then break back down into glucose, the first form the plant made. Then, the mitochondria in our cells, powered by the oxygen we breath, can turn glucose into pure energy molecules called ATP. ATP powers all work done by each and every one of your cells, things like communication, movement, and transport. But why do we have to turn that glucose into ATP? Well, think of it like this. You're excited to start your summer job at the local ice cream stand, but your boss has just told you that she is going to pay you in ice cream cones. What are you going to be able to do with those ice cream cones? Nothing, which is why you kindly asked to be paid in dollars. ATP is just like dollars. It is the currency that all cells of life use while glucose is, well, kind of like ice cream. Even plants have mitochondria in their cells to break down the glucose they make into ATP. So as you can see, humans and plants are intricately connected. The air we breath out is used by plants to make the carbohydrates we enjoy so much. And, in the process, they are releasing the very same oxygen molecules we need to breath in in order that our mitochondria can break down our delicous carbohydrate meal."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "On average, what percentage of the food we eat on a daily basis comes from carbohydrates?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "20%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "40%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "60%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "80%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What are the pores in a plant's skin called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stigmata"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stomata"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stamen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Strivia"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The sun helps plants transform carbon dioxide into a simple carbohydrate called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cellulose"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Glucose"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fructose"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Maltose"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What's another name for cellulose?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sodium Chloride"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Corn syrup"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Table sugar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fiber"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which organelle is ultimately responsible for breaking down carbohydrates into usable energy at the molecular level?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "ATP"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mitochondria"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ribosomes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Golgi Apparatus"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

In particular, though, some fields don't just need a few numbers, they need lots of them. How do you keep track of all those numbers? Well, mathematicians dating back as early as ancient China came up with a way to represent arrays of many numbers at once. Nowadays we call such an array a \"matrix,\" and many of them hanging out together, \"matrices\". Matrices are everywhere. They are all around us, even now in this very room. Sorry, let's get back on track. Matrices really are everywhere, though. They are used in business, economics, cryptography, physics, electronics, and computer graphics. One reason matrices are so cool is that we can pack so much information into them and then turn a huge series of different problems into one single problem. So, to use matrices, we need to learn how they work. It turns out, you can treat matrices just like regular numbers. You can add them, subtract them, even multiply them. You can't divide them, but that's a rabbit hole of its own. Adding matrices is pretty simple. All you have to do is add the corresponding entries in the order they come. So the first entries get added together, the second entries, the third, all the way down. Of course, your matrices have to be the same size, but that's pretty intuitive anyway. You can also multiply the whole matrix by a number, called a scalar. Just multiply every entry by that number. But wait, there's more! You can actually multiply one matrix by another matrix. It's not like adding them, though, where you do it entry by entry. It's more unique and pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Here's how it works. Let's say you have two matrices. Let's make them both two by two, meaning two rows by two columns. Write the first matrix to the left and the second matrix goes next to it and translated up a bit, kind of like we are making a table. The product we get when we multiply the matrices together will go right between them. We'll also draw some gridlines to help us along. Now, look at the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix. See how there's two numbers in each? Multiply the first number in the row by the first number in the column: 1 times 2 is 2. Now do the next ones: 3 times 3 is 9. Now add them up: 2 plus 9 is 11. Let's put that number in the top-left position so that it matches up with the rows and columns we used to get it. See how that works? You can do the same thing to get the other entries. -4 plus 0 is -4. 4 plus -3 is 1. -8 plus 0 is -8. So, here's your answer. Not all that bad, is it? There's one catch, though. Just like with addition, your matrices have to be the right size. Look at these two matrices. 2 times 8 is 16. 3 times 4 is 12. 3 times wait a minute, there are no more rows in the second matrix. We ran out of room. So, these matrices can't be multiplied. The number of columns in the first matrix has to be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix. As long as you're careful to match up your dimensions right, though, it's pretty easy. Understanding matrix multiplication is just the beginning, by the way. There's so much you can do with them. For example, let's say you want to encrypt a secret message. Let's say it's \"Math rules\". Though, why anybody would want to keep this a secret is beyond me. Letting numbers stand for letters, you can put the numbers in a matrix and then an encryption key in another. Multiply them together and you've got a new encoded matrix. The only way to decode the new matrix and read the message is to have the key, that second matrix. There's even a branch of mathematics that uses matrices constantly, called Linear Algebra. If you ever get a chance to study Linear Algebra, do it, it's pretty awesome. But just remember, once you know how to use matrices, you can do pretty much anything."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Matrices can be dated back to as early as _________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Neandrathals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mesopotamia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ancient China"}, {"label": "D", "text": "200 BC"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What's the number called that's used to multiply each entry in a matrix?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vector"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Scalar"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Exponent"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Variant"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is not true about matrices?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When adding matrices together, they have to be the same size."}, {"label": "B", "text": "You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide matrices."}, {"label": "C", "text": "You can multiply an entire matrix by another matrix."}, {"label": "D", "text": "You can multiply a matrix by any number."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Matrices are used in all of the following fields: business, economics, cryptography, physics, electronics, and computer graphics.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Encryption keys are necessary to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decode encrypted matrices"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Multiply sections of a large matrix"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Divide matrices that have already been multiplied"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Capture large amounts of numbers into no more than two matrices"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

He studied myths from all over the world\nand published a book called \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces,\" retelling dozens of stories and explaining how each\nrepresents the mono-myth, or Hero's Journey. So, what is the \"hero's journey\"? Think of it as a cycle. The journey begins and ends\nin a hero's ordinary world, but the quest passes\nthrough an unfamiliar, special world. Along the way, there are some key events. Think about your favorite book or movie. Does it follow this pattern? Status quo, that's where we start. 1:00: Call to Adventure. The hero receives a mysterious message. An invitation, a challenge? 2:00: Assistance The hero needs some help,\nprobably from someone older, wiser. 3:00: Departure The hero crosses the threshold\nfrom his normal, safe home, and enters the special\nworld and adventure. We're not in Kansas anymore. 4:00: Trials Being a hero is hard work: our hero solves a riddle, slays a monster, escapes from a trap. 5:00: Approach It's time to face the biggest ordeal,\nthe hero's worst fear.

Nothing is quite the same\nonce you are a hero. Many popular books and movies follow this ancient\nformula pretty closely. But let's see how well \"The Hunger Games\"\nfits the hero's journey template. When does Katniss Everdeen\nhear her call to adventure that gets the story moving? When her sister's name\nis called from the lottery. How about assistance? Is anyone going to help\nher on her adventure? Haymitch. What about departure? Does she leave her ordinary world? She gets on a train to the capital. OK, so you get the idea. What do you have in common\nwith Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo? Well, you're human, just like them. The Hero's Journey myth\nexists in all human cultures and keeps getting updated, because we humans reflect on our world through symbolic stories of our own lives. You leave your comfort zone, have an experience that transforms you, and then you recover and do it again. You don't literally slay\ndragons or fight Voldemort, but you face problems just as scary. Joseph Campbell said, \"In the cave you fear to enter\nlies the treasure you seek.\" What is the symbolic\ncave you fear to enter? Auditions for the school play? Baseball tryouts? Love? Watch for this formula in books,\nmovies, and TV shows you come across. You will certainly see it again. But also be sensitive\nto it in your own life. Listen for your call to adventure.

Majestic whirlpools of stars, they rotate in a stately and predictable dance. The fact that we see many billions of them in our telescopes tells us they are both common and stable. It is perhaps surprising that it is relatively easy to understand the inner workings of these cosmic pinwheels. By combining physical principles worked out by Sir Isaac Newton in the late 17th century, with the observed amount of mass in a galaxy, scientists can calculate the rates at which these galaxies rotate. Using these techniques, astronomers predict how fast stars at different distances from the center of the galaxy should move. Stars very close to the center move slowly. That's because there is very little mass between them and the center of the galaxy to pull them along. Stars a bit further away move faster, because they are being pulled by all of the stars in between them and the center. As we get really far away, the stars are predicted to move slowly again. Their great distance reduces gravity to a gentle tug, so they move leisurely in their orbits. Knowing this, scientists looked at the galaxies and measured how fast stars were moving. To their surprise, they found that while the stars closer to the center of the galaxy behaved as predicted, those further away moved far too quickly. This observation was devastating to the tradtional theories of gravity and motion. If the stars were moving as fast as their measurement suggested, galaxies should have torn themselves apart. It was a crisis, and astronomers and physicists scrambled to find a mistake in their calculation. Was Newton's theory of gravity wrong? Was his theory of motion wrong? Or was it possible that astronomers had incorrectly measured the galaxy's mass? All options were investigated, and all were ruled out. Except one. Today, scientists believe that the answer lies in a previously unknown kind of matter, called dark matter. This dark matter can be envisioned as a cloud which surrounds most galaxies. This matter is very unusual. It is affected by gravity, but it is invisible to visible light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The name \"dark matter\" originates in this form of matter's inability to emit or absorb light. Dark matter adds to the gravity of the galaxy and explains the orbital speed of stars far from the galactic center. Dark matter has not yet been directly observed, but scientists believe that it is likely to be real, mostly because the other options have been ruled out. Using dozens of approaches, astronomers and physicists continue to search for direct evidence that would prove that the dark matter hypothesis is true.

{"page": 102, "lesson": 12, "title": "Calculating the odds of intelligent alien life - Jill Tarter", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/calculating-the-odds-of-intelligent-alien-life", "transcript": {"en": "Transcriber: Ido Dekkers\nReviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo (Music) The basic question is, does life exist beyond Earth? Scientists who are called astrobiologists are trying to find that out right now. Most astrobiologists are trying to figure out if there's microbial life on Mars, or in the ocean under the frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa, or in the liquid hydrocarbon lakes that we've found on Saturn's moon Titan. But one group of astrobiologists works on SETI. SETI is the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and SETI researchers are trying to detect some evidence that intelligent creatures elsewhere have used technology to build a transmitter of some sort. But how likely is it that they will manage to find a signal? There are certainly no guarantees when it comes to SETI, but something called the Drake equation, named after Frank Drake, can help us organize our thinking about what might be required for successful detection. If you've dealt with equations before, then you probably expect that there will be a solution to the equation, a right answer. The Drake equation, however, is different, because there are so many unknowns. It has no right answer. As we learn more about our universe and our place within it, some of the unknowns get better known, and we can estimate an answer a bit better. But there won't be a definite answer to the Drake equation until SETI succeeds or something else proves that Earthlings are the only intelligent species in our portion of the cosmos. In the meantime, it is really useful to consider the unknowns. The Drake equation attempts to estimate the number of technological civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy -- we call that N -- with whom we could make contact, and it's usually written as: N equals R-star multiplied by f-sub-p multiplied by n-sub-e multiplied by f-sub-l multiplied by f-sub-i multiplied by f-sub-c and lastly, multiplied by capital L. All those factors multiplied together help to estimate the number of technological civilizations that we might be able to detect right now. R-star is the rate at which stars have been born in the Milky Way Galaxy over the last few billion years, so it's a number that is stars per year. Our galaxy is 10 billion years old, and early in its history stars formed at a different rate. All of the f-factors are fractions. Each one must be less than or equal to one. F-sub-p is the fraction of stars that have planets. N-sub-e is the average number of habitable planets in any planetary system. F-sub-l is the fraction of planets on which life actually begins and f-sub-i is the fraction of all those life forms that develop intelligence. F-sub-c is the fraction of intelligent life that develops a civilization that decides to use some sort of transmitting technology. And finally, L -- the longevity factor. On average, how many years do those transmitters continue to operate? Astronomers are now almost able to tell us what the product of the first three terms is. We're now finding exoplanets almost everywhere. The fractions dealing with life and intelligence and technological civilizations are ones that many, many experts ponder, but nobody knows for sure. So far, we only know of one place in the universe where life exists, and that's right here on Earth. In the next couple of decades, as we explore Mars and Europa and Titan, the discovery of any kind of life there will mean that life will be abundant in the Milky Way. Because if life originated twice within this one Solar System, it means it was easy, and given similar conditions elsewhere, life will happen. So the number two is a very important number here. Scientists, including SETI researchers, often tend to make very crude estimates and acknowledge that there are very large uncertainties in these estimates, in order to make progress. We think we know that R-star and n-sub-e are both numbers that are closer to 10 than, say, to one, and all the f-factors are less than one. Some of them may be much less than one. But of all these unknowns, the biggest unknown is L, so perhaps the most useful version of the Drake equation is simply to say that N is approximately equal to L. The information in this equation is very clear. Unless L is large, N will be small. But, you know, you can also turn that around. If SETI succeeds in detecting a signal in the near future, after examining only a small portion of the stars in the Milky Way, then we learn that L, on average, must be large. Otherwise, we couldn't have succeeded so easily. A physicist named Philip Morrison summarizes by saying that SETI is the archaeology of the future. By this, he meant that because the speed of light is finite, any signals detected from distant technologies will be telling us about their past by the time they reach us. But because L must be large for a successful detection, we also learn about our future, particularly that we can have a long future. We've developed technologies that can send signals into space and humans to the moon, but we've also developed technologies that can destroy the environment, that can wage war with weapons and biological terrorism. In the future, will our technology help stabilize our planet and our population, leading to a very long lifetime for us? Or will we destroy our world and its inhabitants after only a brief appearance on the cosmic stage? I encourage you to consider the unknowns in this equation.

For example, what would it feel like to be a dog? Do fish feel pain? How about insects? Was the Big Bang just an accident? And is there a God? And if so, how are we so sure that it's a He and not a She? Why do so may innocent people and animals suffer terrible things? Is there really a plan for my life? Is the future yet to be written, or is it already written and we just can't see it? But then, do I have free will? Who am I, anyway? Am I just a biological machine? But then, why am I conscious? What is consciousness? Will robots become conscious one day? I mean, I kind of assumed that some day I would be told the answers to all these questions. I mean, someone must know, right? Huh.

Well, this is the famous question\nasked by Enrico Fermi in 1950: \"Where is everybody?\" Conspiracy theorists claim\nthat UFOs are visiting all the time and the reports are just being covered up, but honestly, they aren't very convincing. But that leaves a real riddle. In the past year,\nthe Kepler space observatory has found hundreds of planets\njust around nearby stars, and if you extrapolate that data, it looks like there could be\nhalf a trillion planets just in our own galaxy. If any one in 10,000 has conditions\nthat might support a form of life, that's still 50 million possible\nlife-harboring planets right here in the Milky Way. So here's the riddle. Our Earth didn't form until about 9 billion years\nafter the Big Bang. Countless other planets in our galaxy\nshould have formed earlier and given life a chance to get underway billions or certainly\nmany millions of years earlier than happened on Earth. If just a few of them\nhad spawned intelligent life and started creating technologies, those technologies\nwould have had millions of years to grow in complexity and power. On Earth, we've seen how dramatically\ntechnology can accelerate in just 100 years. In millions of years,\nan intelligent alien civilization could easily have spread out\nacross the galaxy, perhaps creating giant\nenergy-harvesting artifacts, or fleets of colonizing spaceships, or glorious works of art\nthat fill the night sky. At the very least, you'd think\nthey'd be revealing their presence, deliberately or otherwise, through electromagnetic signals\nof one kind or another. And yet we see no convincing\nevidence of any of it. Why? Well, there are numerous possible answers, some of them quite dark. Maybe a single,\nsuperintelligent civilization has indeed taken over the galaxy, and has imposed strict radio silence because it's paranoid\nof any potential competitors. It's just sitting there\nready to obliterate anything that becomes a threat. Or maybe they're not that intelligent. Or perhaps, the evolution\nof an intelligence capable of creating\nsophisticated technology is far rarer than we've assumed. After all, it's only happened once on Earth in 4 billion years. Maybe even that was incredibly lucky. Maybe we are the first\nsuch civilization in our galaxy. Or, perhaps, civilization carries with it the seeds of its own destruction through the inability to control\nthe technologies it creates. But there are numerous\nmore hopeful answers. For a start, we're not looking that hard, and we're spending a pitiful\namount of money on it. Only a tiny fraction\nof the stars in our galaxy have really been looked at closely\nfor signs of interesting signals. And perhaps, we're not looking\nthe right way. Maybe as civilizations develop, they quickly discover\ncommunication technologies far more sophisticated and useful\nthan electromagnetic waves. Maybe all the action takes place inside the mysterious\nrecently discovered dark matter, or dark energy, that appear to account\nfor most of the universe's mass. Or maybe we're looking at the wrong scale. Perhaps intelligent civilizations\ncome to realize that life is ultimately just complex\npatterns of information interacting with each other\nin a beautiful way, and that can happen\nmore efficiently at a small scale. So just as on Earth, clunky stereo systems\nhave shrunk to beautiful, tiny iPods, maybe intelligent life itself, in order to reduce its footprint\non the environment, has turned itself microscopic, so the Solar System\nmight be teeming with aliens, and we're just not noticing them. Maybe the very ideas in our heads\nare a form of alien life. Well, okay, that's a crazy thought. The aliens made me say it. But it is cool that ideas do seem\nto have a life all of their own, and that they outlive their creators. Maybe biological life\nis just a passing phase. Well, within the next 15 years, we could start seeing\nreal spectroscopic information from promising nearby planets that will reveal just how\nlife-friendly they might be. And meanwhile SETI, the Search for\nExtra-Terrestrial Intelligence, is now releasing its data to the public so that millions of citizen scientists,\nmaybe including you, can bring the power of the crowd\nto join the search. And here on Earth,\namazing experiments are being done to try to create life from scratch, life that might be very different\nfrom the DNA forms we know. All of this will help us understand whether the universe is teeming with life or, whether indeed, it's just us. Either answer, in its own way, is awe-inspiring, because even if we are alone, the fact that we think and dream, and ask these questions might yet turn out to be\none of the most important facts about the universe. And I have one more piece\nof good news for you. The quest for knowledge\nand understanding never gets dull. It doesn't. It's actually the opposite. The more you know, the more amazing the world seems. And it's the crazy possibilities,\nthe unanswered questions, that pull us forward.

films and the romantic films of the 40's was definitely an influence on on Star Wars Errol Flynn kinds of movies I mean everything is of that genre which is the fantasy action-adventure kinds of films of that period of time in the in the cinema look the whole premise of Star Wars was that it was a romantic fantasy in the in the great romantic traditions of mythology and King Arthur and the romantic side of fighting where there was chivalry and honor and that sort of things so in developing a group of peacekeepers who were above everything and an honorable and could make decisions and and bring peace to the galaxy I needed a weapon that was appropriate for those kinds of Jedi the father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldn't allow what is it your father's lightsaber this is the weapon of a Jedi Knight not as clumsy or random as a blaster an elegant weapon for a more civilized day it was more a symbol of a simpler time of a time before the Empire taken over a time when honor ruled so it was more of a symbol than it was an actual weapon in the movie moki religions and ancient weapons were no match for a good blaster - sorry kid you don't believe in the force do you the original concept was that the Jedi would fight with swords and then I wanted to make it a futuristic kind of sword so I made it a lightsaber which those are of a laser sword to give it that technology edge to it in an age of ray guns and that sort of thing that would deflect the rays and since they're the whole premise was that a Jedi was there to protect himself and not really be offensive but be defensive that a laser sword in a world of ray guns would be a perfect defensive weapon started out as a kind of oriental form of swordplay where there was a lot of honor involved a lot of skill and craft and higher spiritual meaning to the sword fight and so they were very simple and in the beginning of the first film episode 4 it was a fight between a very old man and a man who was only a partially a man and mostly a mechanical beam so it wasn't really much of a sword fight at all but I guess I lost it only a master of evil does the original lightsaber was actually the flash attachment to a four by five camera and we just took the round flash part off and then made it into a lightsaber George was adamant that these things were really really heavy that we couldn't take a hand off we always had to have two like X calibers is 240 50 pounds of weight they were very powerful and a lot of energy in them and so that was you you know you worked with them as if they were heavy so because when he's crashed together they obey these big explosions and all kinds of things as we went on we wanted to have the lightsaber fights become faster and more intense as Luke became more proficient in the art of sword fighting and so we very slowly started moving away from the two-handed form which is more oriental to sometimes using a one-handed form and it's progressed further and further into a more two-handed and one-handed form but originally it was that you needed two hands to hold on to this lightsaber because of the amount of energy that is being swung around see you can do it I call it luck in my experience there's no such thing as luck The effect of the lightsaber was basically a rotating poll that had movie screen material applied to it so that it would reflect its light source packet many times the intensity problem was that when you moved it out of a certain area it went from glowing and looking great to just a rotating pole we rotated with reflective tape so that would flash and it would create light on the actors on that never really worked as soon as they hit each other they broke the lightsabers so then we just used the sticks with the reflective material on it as we moved on we got more proficient at actually doing sword fighting we then use swords that did to have the reflective material but we toned down the fact that we had to shoot the light through the lens and a lot of other things to try to make it so we could be more facile in the way we shot these fights when I beat a tech - I thought it would just be handled and they put in cartoon blades later but if you were if you were sword fighting you you wouldn't know when to stop your hand you needed something to strike every laser sword really is part real and part animated and we need the real poll to tell us where the sword blade is and sometimes we'll use a short blade because they're fighting so close that they would hit the set and things like that and sometimes we use no blade because the blade would turn on in the shop or what they were doing was so complicated that we couldn't do it with swords themselves and then we would add the sword in later but that takes a lot of very careful tracking to figure out where the sword blade would be and even later on in the second and third one when they decided that it was more trouble than was worth to try and get on Sat shots that they just do it all in post we still had part of a shaft just so that there would be something to come up against that really had a lot to do with the advances in special-effects technology than it did in anything else as we got more and more able to do rotoscoping on these swords and we were using more advanced technology was easier for us to follow the sword and copy them and you know create laser swords it is useless to exist don't let yourself be destroyed as obi-wan did even though the like sabers were kind of chintzy when we were shooting him in post-production they were able to give him the look that they needed to have of course the great sound Ben Burtt sound effects the sound of the lightsaber was turned over to Ben Burke in the first film Ben worked you know really right from the very GetGo while I was working on the script and I would tell them that I needed a voice for our - I needed a voice for you know the breathing of Darth Vader I'd need a sound for ray guns I knew sound for laser swords the very first sound I created for the film was the lightsaber and it was I think what happened was I saw some of the Ralph McQuarrie artwork on the wall and I was a picture of Luke lighting at the end of the movie and they had these lightsabers and I thought immediately something went off in my mind and I and I had a feeling for what they would sound like in the booth where we projected films those projectors made a hum when they weren't running they were just idling that the motors would sit there with this kind of magical mysterious humming sound that I thought was musical in a way and I thought that's probably what a lightsaber would sound like yo Paul was a weak old man you can't wind us if you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine and I was searching for some other element and I had a tape recorder with a broken mic cable it was actually the shielding and coming off of it and when I walked past the television set in my apartment it picked up the hum from the picture too directly into the broken wire and that made a buzz and I said that's a great buzz that's not as dangerous so I recorded the buzz now normally a sound person doesn't want to buzz or hum in this case the buzz in the hum were the answer and of course I had to take that sound and make the pass bys and the swishes of the sword out of it and so he spent you know the better part of a year working on those sounds trying to create those sounds the first time I put in the sounds of the lightsabers he was in it you know temporary cut of the film and not much comment was made about it and I but I have since learned that when no comment is made then it's fantastic that it's it's passes the test impressive most impressive ultimately the sound for the laser sword because we wanted something with a lot of energy was a combination of several different sounds from a swooshing vacuum cleaner to kind of clash when when something hits dry ice and we've modified it since then as yes we get weapons that move faster and be a double-edged blade savoring some of the newer films but it's always based on that same recording there's nothing you could have done Luke had you been there you'd have been killed too and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire I want to come with you to Alderaan there's nothing for me here now I want to learn the ways of the force and become a Jedi like my father in every episode from four five and six I kept improving the sword fighting because of the assumption was is that Luke was getting to be a better fighter he was learning more but at the same time he still wasn't you know being trained as an original Jedi would have been trained a Jedi uses the force for knowledge in defense never but tell me why I can't know there is no way nothing more would I teach you today an Empire Strikes Back it's the first time that the antagonist and pro Tigers actually fight each other so that it is a very big fight and Luke now has become proficient enough to be able to face Darth Vader so it's a slightly one-sided sword fight where Vader has the advantage over him but Luke didn't know that Vader was his father for the most really for fight part so that what it was happening is he thought he was fighting his bitter enemy and so he was fighting as hard as he could he thought he was fighting the man killed his father fighting the man who killed obi-wan Kenobi fighting the man who you know would personify evil in the universe and then as we go on into the next fight it becomes more of a an equal confrontation in the next one The Return of the Jedi he knew he was fighting his father I see you have constructed a new lightsaber he knew that the Emperor was behind all this your skills are complete and he knew that the issues that he was dealing with much larger than just the sword fight indeed you are powerful as the emperor has foreseen and so that sword fight really centered on the more emotional context the sword fight takes place in than the actual fighting itself that was the climax of the film rather than having it be a technological warfare blow up the Death Star kind of thing it was really more of a personal fight between a father and his son then when we move to the prequel where there were Jedi on their full flower and fighting as they were in the past you know well trained Jedi then we had to make the sword fights much much faster much more sophisticated and much more aggressive in terms of the way they're fought and we continued that brave of you boy what I would have thought you had learned your lesson hi I'm miss Lola manikin the fights becomes actually much more ferocious in save ones in Episode four five and six well at your head held that right now this is just the beginning each one builds on the other because the fights become more personal until we get to Episode three where it's a very personal form of fighting this particular one they have to fight each other so this is very very long fight difference between the two characters is that Obi one has more experience but Anika is more powerful that was good hey thanks everybody you know I'm here today as Luke Skywalker but I'm also here to talk about Sprint as you can see you stand to save up to 17 cents a month over the

Not the whole song, but a fragment of it\nthat plays and replays until you find yourself unloading\nthe vegetables in time to the beat. You've been struck by an earworm,\nand you're not alone. Over 90% of people are plagued\nby earworms at least once a week, and about a quarter of people\nexperience them several times a day. They tend to burrow in during tasks\nthat don't require much attention, say, when waiting on water to boil or a traffic light to change. This phenomenon is one \nof the mind's great mysteries. Scientists don't know \nexactly why it's so easy for tunes to get stuck in our heads. From a psychological perspective, earworms are an example of mental imagery. This imagery can be visual, like when you close your eyes\nand imagine a red wagon, or it can be auditory, like when you imagine\nthe sound of a baby screaming, or oil sizzling in a pan. Earworms are a special form \nof auditory imagery because they're involuntary. You don't plug your ears\nand try to imagine \"Who Let the Dogs Out,\" or, well, you probably don't. It just intrudes onto \nyour mental soundscape and hangs around \nlike an unwanted house guest. Earworms tend to be quite vivid and they're normally made up of a tune,\nrather than, say, harmonies. A remarkable feature of earworms\nis their tendency to get stuck in a loop, repeating again and again\nfor minutes or hours. Also remarkable is the role\nof repetition in sparking earworms. Songs tend to get stuck when \nwe listen to them recently and repeatedly. If repetition is such a trigger, then perhaps we can blame our earworms\non modern technology. The last hundred years have seen\nan incredible proliferation of devices that help you listen \nto the same thing again and again. Records, cassettes, CDs, \nor streamed audio files. Have these technologies bread some\nkind of unique, contemporary experience, and are earworms just a product\nof the late 20th century? The answer comes from an unlikely source: Mark Twain. In 1876, just one year \nbefore the phonograph was invented, he wrote a short story\nimagining a sinister takeover of an entire town by a rhyming jingle. This reference, and others, show us that earworms seem \nto be a basic psychological phenomenon, perhaps exacerbated \nby recording technology but not new to this century. So yes, every great historical figure,\nfrom Shakespeare to Sacajawea, may well have wandered around\nwith a song stuck in their head. Besides music, it's hard to think\nof another case of intrusive imagery that's so widespread. Why music? Why don't watercolors \nget stuck in our heads? Or the taste of cheesy taquitos? One theory has to do with the way music\nis represented in memory. When we listen to a song we know, we're constantly hearing forward in time,\nanticipating the next note. It's hard for us to think about one\nparticular musical moment in isolation. If we want to think about the pitch\nof the word \"you\" in \"Happy Birthday,\" we have to start back at \"Happy,\" and sing through until we get to \"you.\" In this way, a tune \nis sort of like a habit. Just like once you start tying your shoe, you're on automatic \nuntil you tighten the bow, once a tune is suggested because, for example, someone says,\n\"my umbrella,\" we have to play through until it\nreaches a natural stopping point, \"ella, ella, ella.\" But this is largely speculation. The basic fact remains we don't know\nexactly why we're susceptible to earworms. But understanding them better \ncould give us important clues to the workings of the human brain. Maybe the next time we're plagued by a Taylor Swift tune \nthat just won't go away, we'll use it as the starting point\nfor a scientific odyssey that will unlock important mysteries\nabout basic cognition. And if not, well, \nwe can just shake it off."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Earworms are experienced by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Most people"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Some people"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A few people"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only people with experience playing an instrument"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Most earworms are composed of a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Timbre"}, {"label": "B", "text": "String of harmonies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tune"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Texture"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A story by Mark Twain is one piece of evidence that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only people in certain cultures are susceptible to earworms"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Earworms existed before the advent of modern recording technology"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Earworms are not important"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Earworms can be cured"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "People are more likely to experience earworms when:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They've been exposed to a song recently and repeatedly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They've tried to ignore a song"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They've never heard a song before"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They've busy engaging in a strenuous task"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Music is especially susceptible to getting stuck in our heads because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Most people like music"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It isn't; other things are equally likely to get stuck in our heads"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Music is similar to language"}, {"label": "D", "text": "We don't know exactly why"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Packed with carbohydrates,\nvitamins, and minerals, the potato was a remarkably\nnutrient-rich crop that made it easy for less wealthy\nfamilies to maintain a balanced diet. By the mid-19th century, potatoes had\nsupplanted other staple foods. And since British mandates ensured\nIreland’s more valuable agricultural products were exported, roughly half the country’s\n8.5 million residents lived almost entirely on potatoes. But when harvesting began in 1845, farmers found their potatoes\nblackened and shriveled. Those who ate them suffered severe\nstomach cramps and even death. Today, we know the culprit was\nPhytophthora infestans— a fungus that flourished in the season’s\nunusually damp weather. But at the time it was simply\ncalled “the blight.” The fungus likely originated\nin the Americas, traveling across the Atlantic on ships. And while it destroyed potato harvests\nacross Europe, wealthier countries— then as today—\ngenerally fared better, as they had more resources to draw on. Meanwhile, the southern and western\nregions of Ireland were already impoverished\nand entirely dependent on the single crop, making them disproportionately vulnerable. The impacts of food insecurity are often\nmost severe at the poverty line. But while the failed harvest\ncreated a class crisis, the government's response turned\nit into a national catastrophe. For centuries, Ireland had been\nunder varying degrees of English control, and by 1845,\nit was part of the United Kingdom with its government based in London. During the famine’s first year, this distant ruling body imported corn\nfrom North America and offered the Irish employment\non public works projects. But this relief only caused more problems. Imported food was poorly distributed\nand offered insufficient nutrition, making the previously healthy population\nmore vulnerable to disease, and increasing maternal\nand child mortality. Worse still, the British continued\nto export Ireland’s grain and livestock. Meanwhile, the public works projects\nrequired lengthy shifts of grueling manual labour and\nwere far from where most workers lived. For example, just one of countless tragic\nincidences is the story of Thomas Malone, who walked 18 kilometers roundtrip\nto work every day. One night, exhausted and starving, he collapsed and died\njust before reaching home, leaving behind his wife and six children. Despite the year’s countless tragedies,\nmany families managed to scrape by. But in 1846, the damp weather returned\nand the blight worsened, impacting 75% of Ireland's potato yield. British relief efforts diminished\nsubstantially in the famine’s second year. And while international aid\nhelped save lives, the overall need was enormous. As the crisis wore on, the government\nlimited who was eligible for relief and tasked Ireland with funding the relief\nefforts themselves by increasing local taxes. Most modern historians view these\ndisastrous policies as stemming from a mix\nof toxic religious ideology, laissez-faire economic policies,\nand political infighting. British news sources callously\ndepicted the Irish as lazy, simple-minded alcoholics, and some London decision-makers believed\nthe famine was God’s punishment for these sinful behaviors. Other government officials purposefully\nblocked efforts to provide meaningful relief\ndue to internal political rivalries. As with famines and food insecurity today, it wasn't a lack of resources preventing\nthe British from aiding Ireland, but rather a lack of political will. Seven years after the blight began, Ireland’s weather patterns\nreturned to normal and the potato crop finally stabilised. But over 1 million people had perished\nfrom starvation, malnutrition, and disease. Between 1 and 2 million more\nfled the country, beginning a trend that dropped Ireland’s\npopulation to half its pre-famine levels by the 1920s. Today, climate change is making\nextreme weather more common and sustained, leading countless agricultural communities\nto face similar struggles. Just as in Ireland,\nfarmers living on the margins are increasingly facing starvation,\nmalnutrition, and disease due to global weather patterns\nfor which they bear little responsibility. But history doesn’t have to repeat itself\nif governments and institutions can provide the kind of aid\nthese regions need: relief efforts that are coordinated\nand ongoing, provide sufficient nutrition\nto prevent disease, and are offered with compassion\nrather than judgment."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the approximate population of Ireland before the famine?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2.5 million"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5.5 million"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6.5 million"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8.5 million"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What caused Ireland’s potato crops to fail in the late 1840s?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A fungus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Inundation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A bacteria"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wildfires"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Where was the seat of Ireland’s government at the time of the famine?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Belfast"}, {"label": "B", "text": "London"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Edinburgh"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dublin"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following do historians believe contributed to the government’s failure to offer adequate assistance to the Irish?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Toxic religious ideology"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Laissez-faire economic policies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Political infighting"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "By the 1920’s, Ireland’s population had dropped to about _____ of its pre-famine levels.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "25%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "33%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "75%"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

But appearances can be deceiving. On the coast of this expanse, just a few meters beneath the ice\nlies a multicolored constellation of life. This remarkably diverse realm is home\nto over 8,000 species of sea denizens who rely on an arsenal\nof otherworldly traits to survive. So how do these species not only live,\nbut thrive, in conditions most animals\nwould be unable to bear? Antarctic waters are some of the most\nconsistently frigid in the world, hovering below 0 degrees Celsius\nfor a large portion of the year. This means burning energy\ntoo quickly can be deadly, so survival in this ecosystem\nlooks slow and steady. Freezing temperatures persist\neven in the summer, but this season brings\na rare gift: sunlight. For a brief period, it’s abundant, shining through the ice\nfor 24 hours a day. This infusion of energy drives intense\ncoastal phytoplankton blooms, transforming the waters\ninto a thick green soup. Marine life both large and small\ntakes advantage of this bounty, including the giant Antarctic isopod. Cousins of the humble pill bug, these crustaceans can reach\nup to 11 centimeters long, and they never miss the opportunity\nfor a meal. The scavengers eat a wide variety of prey,\nincluding other giant isopods. And by slowing their metabolisms,\nthey can make this food last, with one study showing specimens surviving\nfor 50 days without eating. Since this adaptation involves careful\nconservation of energy, giant isopods spend most of their time\nstationary or inching across the seafloor. Meanwhile, their tiny amphipod relatives\ncelebrate the summer by releasing offspring\nalongside the algal explosion, ensuring their young have\nan abundance of food. And sea cucumbers carpeting the seafloor\nhoover up the dense plankton with outstretched\ntentacles, producing nutrient-rich feces\nthat nourish nearby life. But this big summer blowout\ndoesn’t last long. The first signs of autumn arrive\nin fine needles of frazil ice. These slowly coagulating crystals\nform a skin across the surface, then mix with falling snow\nbefore freezing into a thin crust of ice. The waters get darker and colder. And in this swiftly dimming world, a set of long, spiky limbs\nsidle into view. With up to six pairs of legs,\nthese giant sea spiders aren’t arachnids, but rather a related class of marine\narthropod unique to the seafloor. In addition to housing some\nof the animal’s organs, its legs are covered in tiny holes, which grow more numerous\nas the spider ages. These holes will likely help absorb\nthe dissolved oxygen that saturates these freezing\nsouthern waters. Since oxygen fuels growth, many local species have evolved\nto take advantage of this abundance, and it may be one of the reasons that\ngigantism is so common in this region. Individual sea spiders, for instance,\ncan grow to the size of dinner plates. But soon, these underwater giants\nwill be moving slower than ever. As winter settles in,\nthe sea floor becomes even colder. Waters fall to negative\n1.8 degrees Celsius. On the surface, the thin icy crust\nthickens into a layer called nilas, and young sea ice starts forming\nridges that block out the sun. The ocean begins to mirror\nthe still landscape above it. Antarctic sea cucumbers and urchins\ngo into dormancy for months, and their metabolic rates fall\nto the slowest on Earth. Antarctic limpets continue feeding, but at such a gradual pace that they're\nlargely still surviving on energy reserves from the summer. Tiny crustaceans survive off the traces\nof algae growing on their home’s icy ceiling, raising their young in these expansive\nwinter nurseries. But this seemingly endless winter\nwon't last forever.

Piranhas dart about in the rapidly\napproaching water. So, are you doomed? Will your fall trigger\na fatal feeding frenzy? To forecast your fate, let’s see\nwhat we know about these fish. There are more than 30 piranha species. All live in the fresh waters\nof South America and have a single row of sharp,\ninterlocking teeth on each jaw. They use their teeth in a variety of ways. Many are omnivorous and supplement diets\nof things like insects, crustaceans, worms, and fish with fruits, seeds,\nand other plant matter. Some, like red-bellied piranhas,\nboth hunt and scavenge. And others, like wimple piranhas,\nhave specific dietary predilections, almost exclusively going\nafter other fish’s scales. Species like redeye piranhas\nare more solitary, while red-bellied piranhas\nform shoals of 10 to 100. Red-bellied piranhas are among\nthe most popularly depicted and commonly regarded\nas especially aggressive. However, their reputation for rapacious\npack hunting is misinformed. It’s thought that the main benefit\nof their group-living isn’t cooperative hunting but instead protection from predators,\nof which they have many. Larger, mature red-bellied piranhas\ntend to assume privileged positions at the shoal’s center,\nwhere it’s safest. And scientists have observed that\nred-bellied piranhas in smaller groups breathe faster, probably because they’re more anxious. Interestingly, they also communicate. By rapidly contracting specialized muscles\nabove their swim bladders, they repeatedly “bark” when they’re facing\noff with one another or when captured. They make thudding noises when they’re\naggressively circling each other, fighting, or competing for food. And when things escalate further, they chase each other\nwhile snapping their jaws together. Researchers suspect that these sounds are just a sampling\nof their overall repertoire, which might also have\nsome special uses during mating. But when do red-bellied piranhas\nget aggressive with humans? Well, when they do bite people, it seems to mostly happen in scenarios\nwhen they’re being handled; when people are spilling food or\ncleaning their fishing catch in the water; or when people disturb piranhas\nwhile the fish are mating or guarding their eggs\nduring the wet season. Starvation stress is also thought\nto lead red-bellied piranhas to increasingly bold, aggressive behavior. And this could theoretically result\nin feeding frenzies where each fish tries to get some\nof whatever finds its way into the water. Despite this kind of behavior\nbeing extremely rare, rumors of it launched the piranha’s\ninternational infamy. And this was in no small part thanks\nto former US President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1914, he published a bestselling book\nin which he called piranhas “the most ferocious fish in the world” and wrote that the scent of blood\ncould incite them to rapidly devour an entire cow—\nor human— alive. But Roosevelt’s account is generally\nconsidered circumstantial and misleading. The “feeding frenzy” he witnessed is\nsuspected to have been the result of people purposefully starving\nred-bellied piranhas, then giving them the opportunity\nto feed on a cow carcass— all to put on an exciting show. But where were we?\nAh, yes. Falling into piranha-infested waters. So, what’s your fate? Let’s assume these are\nred-bellied piranhas. This being the Amazon River, they should be doing alright\nfor themselves and not starving. Thankfully, you’re also not hitting\nthe water alongside a bunch of fish guts. And ideally, you're not disrupting\na piranha breeding extravaganza. You fall in, and the piranhas\nmost likely avoid you. Calmly, softly swimming or wading to shore\nis generally recommended because splashing is thought\nto attract piranhas. Indeed, they’re equipped\nwith the dentition to do damage, but they rarely attack humans. They usually have better things to eat. As you make your way onto dry land, there is no feeding frenzy where they\nskeletonize your body within minutes.

As Demeter, goddess of the harvest,\nit’s your favorite season. Humans and animals look to you to balance\nthe bounty of the natural world, which, like any self-respecting goddess,\nyou do with a pair of magical dice. Every day you roll the dice at dawn, and all lands that match the sum\nof the two dice produce their resources. The resulting frequency of sums\nacross the season keeps your land in perfect harmony;\nany other rates would spell ruin. And that’s why it was particularly rotten\nwhen Loki, the Norse trickster god, invaded your land and cursed your dice,\ncausing all the dots to fall off. When you try to reaffix them, you find that one die won’t accept\nmore than four dots on any of its sides, though the other has no such constraint. You can use Hephaestus’ furnace to seal\nthe dots in place before the sun rises, but once sealed you can’t move\nor remove them again. How can you craft your dice so that,\nwhen rolled and summed, every total comes up with\nthe exact same frequency as it would with standard 6-sided dice? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Normal dice can roll any sum from 2 to 12, but sums in the middle tend to come\nup more frequently than ones on the ends. We can see the odds of rolling any sum\nby making a table, with all the possibilities for one die\nrepresented on the top, and those for the other on the side. The table lets us see at a glance\nthat there are six ways to roll a 7, but only two ways to roll a 3. This also gives us an approach\nto crafting our new set of dice. Matching the original sum frequencies\nmeans that the locations of the sums in this table may change, but the numbers and quantities\nof each sum must stay the same. In other words, there still must be\nexactly one 2, two 3s, and so on. To start, we’ve got to roll that 2, and since we have to use\npositive, whole numbers, there’s only one choice: \neach die needs a 1 on it. What else do we know? Assuming we have a 4— the highest\nnumber possible— on the cursed die, the other one would need an 8\nin order to have one way to roll 12. In fact, we know we require a single 1\nand a single 4 on the cursed die, or we’d have too many ways\nto roll a 2 or a 12. So the cursed dies remaining four sides\nmust have a mix of 2s and 3s. If we have three or four 2s, \nwe can roll the sum 3 too many ways. Similarly, if we have three or four 3s,\nwe’d get the sum 11 too often. So the only possibility is for the\ncursed die to have two 2s and two 3s. With one die completed, we should be able to figure out the\nmissing values on the second. First, we need one more way\nto make 10 and 4, so we must have one 3 and one 6. We now need one more way\nto make 5 and 9. That forces us to choose 4 and 5\nfor the final sides. Fill them in, and lo and behold, we have a distribution table where\nevery possible sum shows up the same number of times\nas with our original dice! The discovery of these dice was made\nin 1978 by George Sicherman, which is why they’re referred\nto as “Sicherman dice.” Incredibly, this is the only alternate\nway to make two 6-sided dice with the same distribution of sums\nas standard dice. You send the dice to be reforged,\nconfident that you’ve averted disaster.

But while it might seem like there's\nplenty of room in this vast expanse, some pieces of celestial real estate\nare more valuable than others. Each of these dots is a Lagrange point, and as far as human space exploration\nis concerned, they may be the most important places\nin our solar system. Named after the 18th century mathematician\nwho deduced their positions, Lagrange points are rare places\nof equilibrium in our constantly shifting universe. All celestial bodies exert\na gravitational force on nearby objects, pulling them in and out of orbits. And gravity acts alongside several\napparent forces to determine what those orbits look like. However, Lagrange points are places\nwhere all these forces balance out. So if we place a relatively\nlow mass object here, it will maintain a constant distance\nfrom the massive bodies pulling on it. Essentially, Lagrange points are\ncelestial parking spaces— once an object is there, it requires\nlittle to no energy to stay put. So whenever humans want to keep\nan object in one place for a long time without using tons of fuel, it needs to be orbiting a Lagrange point. However, there are only so many\nof these parking spots. Pairs of massive bodies\nin our solar system generate sets of five Lagrange points. This means our Sun has\nfive points with every planet, and our planets have five points\nwith each of their moons. Adding these up, there are over 1,000\nLagrange points in our solar system— but only a few are useful\nfor human purposes. Many are in locations that are\ntoo difficult to reach or simply not very useful. And for reasons we'll explain in a bit,\nmany others are unstable. Currently, only two of these points\nare heavily used by humans. But we’ll likely use many\nmore in the future— making these limited points\nexclusive real estate. Which begs the question:\nwhat exactly should we park in them? That answer depends\non where each point is. Consider the five Lagrange points\ngenerated by the Sun and the Earth. L1 is located inside Earth's orbit, about 1.5 million kilometers\naway from the planet. With this panoramic view of the Sun,\nunobstructed by Earth’s shadow, L1 is the perfect place\nfor solar-observing satellites. L2 is at the same distance from Earth\nbut outside its orbit and shielded from the Sun, making it the perfect spot\nto observe outer space. In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope\nwent online here, in a spot where the Sun and Earth\nonly occupy a tiny fraction of the sky. L3 is in a particularly\nmysterious location that can never be directly observed\nfrom Earth’s surface. This has made L3 a frequent locale\nin science fiction, though it hasn’t offered much use\nto scientists yet. L4 and L5, however, are a bit different\nfrom their siblings. In every set of five, the first three\nLagrange points are slightly unstable. This means objects will slowly drift\naway from them, though keeping what we’ve parked there\nin place is still energetically cheap. The stability of L4 and L5, however,\nvaries from set to set. If the heavier of the two bodies\ngenerating the points has less than 25 times the mass\nof the lighter body, these points are too unstable\nto park things in. However, if the heavier body is massive\nenough— like it is in Sun-Earth set— then the relevant forces will always\nreturn objects to these equilibrium points, making them our most stable parking spots. That’s why points like these\nnaturally accumulate space objects, such as the Sun-Jupiter set’s L4 and L5,\nwhich host thousands of asteroids. Every Lagrange point in our solar system\nhas its quirks. Some might be perfect for scavenging\nconstruction materials from drifting asteroids. Others might make ideal gas stations\nfor ships headed to deep space, or even host entire human colonies. These points are already home\nto advanced technological achievements, but soon, they could become\nour stepping stones to the stars."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many Lagrange points does the Sun-Earth system have?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Three"}, {"label": "B", "text": "None"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Five"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Seven"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In which Lagrange point is the James Webb Space Telescope located?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "L2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "L3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "L7"}, {"label": "D", "text": "L1"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In the Sun-Jupiter system, which Lagrange points host a stable population of asteroids?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "L1 and L2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "L4 and L1"}, {"label": "C", "text": "This system contains no stable population of asteroids."}, {"label": "D", "text": "L4 and L5"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In the Sun-planet system, what is the defining feature of Lagrange points?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "If another massive planet is positioned there, it will be stable."}, {"label": "B", "text": "An object located there will rapidly fall into the Sun."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Small objects there maintain a stable distance from the Sun and the planet."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Alien spaceships are parked there."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How far is L2 from Earth?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1.5 million kilometers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "150 million kilometers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1.5 kilometers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1.5 light years"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Beyond the spectrum of light\nyour eyes can see, massive radio waves as wide as houses carry information between computers,\nGPS systems, cell phones, and more. In fact, the signal your phone broadcasts\nis so strong, if your eyes could see radio waves, your phone would be visible from Jupiter. At least your special eyes would be able\nto see this if the sky wasn’t flooded with interference\nfrom routers, satellites, and, of course, people flying who haven't put their\nphones on airplane mode. You see, this setting isn't\nto protect your flight, it's to protect everyone else\nin your flight path. Cell phones connect to networks\nby emitting information in the form of electromagnetic waves; specifically, radio waves, which occupy this band of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. These radio waves come\nin a range of wavelengths, and let’s imagine your special eyes\nsee the various wavelengths as different colors. When you make a call,\nyour phone generates a radio wave signal which it throws to the nearest cell tower. If you're far from service, your phone will expend more battery power\nto send a higher amplitude signal in an effort to make a connection. Once connected, this signal is relayed\nbetween cell towers all the way to your call’s recipient. Since your call isn’t the only\nsignal out here, cell towers managing the calls assign\neach phones involved their own wavelength. This specific color ensures you’re not\npicking up other people’s calls. It’s even slightly different\nfrom the wavelength your phone is receiving information on, so as not to interfere\nwith that incoming signal. But there are only so many\ncolors to choose from. And since the advent of Wi-Fi, the demand for ownership of these\nwavelengths has increased dramatically. With all these signals in the air and\na limited number of colors to assign, avoiding interference is\nincreasingly difficult. Especially when cell towers receive\ntoo many signals at once, such as during regional emergencies, when\neveryone's trying to use their phones. But other sources of interference\nare more preventable, like phones searching for signals\nfrom thousands of meters in the sky. Phones on planes are very\nfar from cell towers, so they work overtime to send\nthe loudest signals they can in search of service. But since planes travel so quickly, the phones might find themselves much\ncloser to a cell tower than expected— blasting it with a massive signal\nthat drowns out those on the ground. So when you fly without\nusing airplane mode, you’re essentially acting\nas a military radio jammer— sending out giant radio waves \nthat interfere with nearby signals. Even on the ground, almost all our\nelectronics emit rogue radio waves, slowing down our internet\nand making our calls choppy. This leads consumers to pay\nfor more bandwidth, pushing service providers to take\nover more of the radio spectrum, and eventually, send more satellites\ninto the sky— creating a vicious cycle that could\neventually blot out the stars. Though, even without these satellites, this system is threatening\nour relationship with the cosmos. Radio telescopes used for astronomy rely on a specific band of wavelengths\nto see deep into space. However, while this range\nis supposedly protected, the cutoffs aren’t enforced. For example, the Very Large Array can see\nsignals throughout our solar system from 1 to 50 GHz. But if it tries looking for signals\nbelow 5 GHz, its search could be drowned\nout by a sea of phones on 5G networks. Today, nowhere on Earth\nis truly radio quiet. Satellites relaying signals\naround the globe have blanketed the planet in radio waves. But there are a few places\nwith less crowded skies, where radio telescopes\ncan look deep into space. Here, we can see the black hole\nat the center of the Milky Way, and uncover the secrets of galaxies\nup to 96 billion light years away.

That's because, chemically speaking, a dead battery is actually not\nthat different from a fresh one. Most of the batteries we use\ntoday take advantage of the fact that some metals like\nto release electrons and others like to accept them. For example, in a typical\nalkaline double-A battery, zinc metal reacts with hydroxide ions, changing into zinc oxide and releasing\nelectrons at the negative terminal. The electrons travel through, say,\na light bulb, and then return to the battery\nat the positive terminal, where they’re accepted\nby manganese dioxide. Different batteries use different\ncombinations of metals, and sometimes non-metals like graphite, but the basic idea is to use\na pair of chemical reactions to generate a stream of electrons. Almost all batteries,\neven single-use batteries, are theoretically rechargeable. That's because the metals and other\nchemicals are still right there. That’s very different than in,\nsay, gasoline, where the liquid hydrocarbon molecules\nare converted to gases. You can't convert exhaust\nback into gasoline, but, with some work you can convert,\nsay, zinc oxide back to zinc. So then what's the difference\nbetween these and these? The short answer is that trying\nto recharge a single-use battery doesn’t just force these reactions\nto run in reverse. It also results in a bunch of side\nreactions that produce useless contaminants, reducing a battery’s capacity; and it could even damage\nthe internal structure of the battery, leading to a loss of electrical contact\nand failure. Rechargeable batteries are engineered\nto avoid these issues. Look at this lithium-ion battery. Both sides have an atomic-level structure\nthat you can imagine as lots of docks. So when the battery is powering something, the lithium “ships” give up their\nelectrons to power the circuit, and then sail over to the other side\nof the battery, dock in an orderly, organized way, and meet up with their\nnow-lower-energy electrons. When the battery is being charged,\nthe opposite happens. Over the course of hundreds,\nsometimes thousands, of charge cycles, some of the lithium ion ships\nsort of veer off course and engage in side reactions, producing stuff that increases\nthe internal resistance of the battery, which in turn makes it lose\nefficiency and power until it inevitably dies. Even when that happens,\nyou can bring dead batteries back to life— whether they’re rechargeable or not—\nby recycling them. The heart of most battery recycling\nis a process called smelting, which is basically just melting\nthe metallic parts. This drives off impurities, returning metals back to their\ninitial, orderly state. Unfortunately, in many countries you can’t\njust toss household batteries in with your regular recycling. You have to take them to a battery\ncollection point or recycling center. Same goes for more complicated\nrechargeable batteries: you need to bring them\nto a collection point or send them back to the company\nyou bought them from. It’s a pain, but absolutely\nworth the time and effort, because recycling batteries is critical. Not only does it prevent\npotentially toxic battery metals from leaking into the environment, it conserves scarce— and vital— resources. Earth has about 22 million tons\nof lithium— enough for about 2.5 billion EVs. That sounds like plenty, but it’s only\n25% higher than the number of EVs experts believe it’ll take to reach\nnet zero emissions by 2050, and that doesn’t even account for laptops,\nphones, and anything else that uses a lithium-ion battery. Currently, though, most lithium-ion\nbatteries are not manufactured with recycling in mind. The designs are intricate\nand non-standard, and the components are held together\nby almost indestructible glues. So today, less than 5% of lithium-ion\nbatteries are recycled. Regulations that clearly define\nwho is responsible for a spent battery and what should happen to it\ncan boost recycling dramatically. For example, lead-acid batteries are\ngenerally subject to stringent regulations and are recycled at much higher rates\nthan lithium-ion batteries. Over the next century, we’ll need\nto recycle huge numbers of EV batteries, so scientists are working on making\nthe battery recycling process cheaper and more environmentally friendly. Smelting uses a lot of energy and,\ndepending on the type of battery, can release harmful by-products. In addition to regulations, industrial\nprocesses, and our own individual choices, battery tech will also continue to evolve. There are proof-of-concept batteries\nbeing developed that can convert physical force, ambient sound,\nand even pee into electricity. But if your top priority is to make your\nnumber one source of power, number one, sorry to say, but urine for a long wait."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Most batteries, even \"single-use\" ones, are theoretically recyclable.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Most batteries work by using ________", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fossil fuels"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Renewable energy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Metals that help exchange electrons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chemical reactions"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Recycling a battery, or bringing a dead battery back to life, requires a process known as", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Reconstitution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Upcycling"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Recharging"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Smelting"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Earth has about ________ tons of lithium, enough for about _____ electric vehicles.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5 million; 100 million"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10 million; 1 billion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "22 million; 2.5 billion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "32 million; 5 billion"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "As of the making of this video, less than ____ of lithium batteries are recycled.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10"}, {"label": "C", "text": "25"}, {"label": "D", "text": "50"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why does battery recycling matter?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": ""}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Otto", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-was-life-like-for-a-court-jester-beatrice-k-otto", "transcript": {"en": "10th century jester Jing Xinmo may have overstepped\nwhen he got chased by a dog, then teasingly told the Chinese emperor that he shouldn’t let his kids\ngo around biting people. The emperor took offense\nand trained an arrow on Jing. But instead of begging for his life,\nJing cracked another joke. Luckily, this pun landed—\nso the emperor’s arrow did not. Contrary to common belief, jesters weren't just a medieval\nEuropean phenomenon, but flourished \nin other times and cultures. The first reliably recorded jester\nis thought to be You Shi, of 7th century BCE China. He declared that, as a jester,\nhis words could not give offense. This privilege was important\nto the jester’s position— but was sometimes violated. Jesters had unique relationships to power: they could be viewed as objects of mockery and also as entertainers\nand trusted companions. People became jesters by various routes. They could be appointed due to physical\nor neurological differences, plucked from a pool of entertainers,\nor recruited by a traveling courtier. Such was the case when a royal servant wrote King Henry VIII’s chief minister\nin the 1530s. He recommended a young boy to replace\nthe king’s aging jester, Sexten, with the assurance that he’d be much more\npleasant than Sexten ever was. Some jesters boasted unique talents,\nlike Roland the Farter, of Henry II’s 12th Century court. Every Christmas,\nhe performed a special routine, the finale of which was\na simultaneous jump, whistle, and fart. Additionally, jesters could influence\nimportant decisions. For example,\nif the clowns of the Tübatulabal nation of the Sierra Nevada mountains thought a chief was leading poorly, they could apparently\nget the elders to appoint a new one. And, of course, Jing Xinmo knew\nhow to sway the Chinese emperor. A local magistrate once requested\nthat the emperor stop trampling farmland during his hunting sprees. Infuriated, the emperor\nhad the magistrate hauled before him. Jing facetiously suggested that\nthe magistrate be put to death immediately and that the emperor\nlet the peasants starve instead of harvesting the land\nand paying taxes, all so he could gallop about freely. Presumably seeing the absurdity\nof his own behavior, the emperor laughed \nand pardoned the magistrate. In 1596, a French man\nwas condemned to death. But Mathurine, one of the relatively few\nfemale jesters on record, intervened in return for payment. With her help, the man’s wife\nsuccessfully pleaded with King Henry IV for her husband’s life. Although rare, jesters were\nsometimes fired or even killed for taking their mockery or criticism\ntoo far. In 1638, Scottish jester Archy Armstrong worsened his already\ncontentious relationship with the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop had recently revised\nthe Scottish Book of Common Prayer— an act that garnered strong opposition\nand incited riots. Taking the opportunity\nto further humiliate him, Archy asked the Archbishop,\n“Who’s the fool now?” For which he was banished from the court. Three years later,\nafter the Archbishop’s arrest, a pamphlet began circulating\nthat ridiculed him, which was said to be the work\nof none other than Archy. Meanwhile, some jesters openly mocked\ntheir royal bosses without consequence. 11th century Persian jester Talhak\nsuggested the sultan was a cuckold, implying his wife was unfaithful to him. One day, as the sultan rested\nhis head on Talhak’s knee, he is said to have inquired,\n“What is your relation to cuckolds?” To which Talhak replied,\n“I am their pillow.” And when 19th century Persian shah asked\nwhether there was a food shortage, jester Karim Shir’ei joked, “Yes, I see Your Majesty is eating\nonly five times a day.” Even when rulers were considered\ndivinely appointed, some jesters managed to speak truth\ndirectly to power, and reveal— in so many riddles,\njokes, or skits— who the real fools were."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following jesters was not mentioned as a historical figure?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Archy Armstrong"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Jing Xinmo"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Till Eulenspiegel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Talhak"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Mathurine"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "As far as we know, the first reliably recorded jester lived in which century?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "12th century AD"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2nd century AD"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2nd century AD"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7th century BC"}, {"label": "E", "text": "11th century BC"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Who is one of the few female jesters on record?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "You Shi"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mathurine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Archy Armstrong"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Jing Xinmo"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Scottish jester Archy Armstrong had a contentious relationship with:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "King Charles I"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pope Urban VIII"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Queen Henrietta"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Archbishop of Canterbury"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
