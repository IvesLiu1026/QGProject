The only way to get him back \nis to race his Coil Runner against the gang yourself. Win and they’ll give back your uncle. Lose and you’ll forfeit the Coil Runner \nand all his other creations. As the grueling race gets underway, you find yourself falling further \nand further behind. Your only chance is to take a shortcut \nyour uncle told you about–– the Flux Ravine gambit. Fortunately, the Coil Runner comes \nequipped with emergency turbo thrusters. Unfortunately, your uncle \nwas a notorious tinkerer, and the system still had some kinks \nto work out. Just minor things \nlike the ignition exploding, the reactor leaking, \nor the oxygen levels depleting— any of which would end \nyour racing career immediately. Before his kidnapping, Uncle Slate determined \nthat each of these critical failures was the ultimate result \nof a chain reaction originating in the thrusters. He was also certain that while one factor\ncould trigger two different effects, and two factors could each independently\nlead to the same effect, no effect is caused by two factors \nin conjunction. However, Uncle Slate \nnever got around to pinpointing which thruster was responsible \nfor which error. All you have \nare the notes from his test runs: 1. When thrusters B and C are on, \nthe Fuel gauge glows. 2.\tWhen thrusters A, B, and D are on, the Fuel gauge glows \nand the Helium tank rattles. 3.\tWhen thrusters C, D, and E are on, the Fuel gauge glows \nand the Gravitometer spins. 4.\tWhen thrusters A, D, and E are on, the Gravitometer spins \nand the Helium tank rattles. 5.\tShortly after the Helium tank rattles \nand the Gravitometer spins, the Ignition explodes \nand the Oxygen levels deplete. 6.\tShortly after the Fuel gauge glows \nand the Gravitometer spins, the Reactor leaks. You need to use \nas many thrusters as possible to give yourself the best chance \nat clearing the gap, without triggering any of the three \ncatastrophic failures. Which thrusters should you activate? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The most important thing \nto remember here is that even if we know \nthat one thing causes another, the converse is not necessarily true. For example, this panic switch \nshuts off the coil runner’s engine. But the engine being off \ndoesn’t necessarily mean the panic switch was engaged— the coil runner could be \nout of fuel, or damaged— or turned off normally. We can, however, \nconclude that if the engine is running, the panic switch hasn’t been engaged. With that in mind, one way we can start \nis to work backwards from the three defects that could \nknock you out of the race. So let’s look at Slate’s last two notes, since they give direct information \nabout those. The Gravitometer spins in both cases, \nbut the results are different. That means the spinning Gravitometer can’t be the cause \nof any particular malfunction. If it were, the same thing would happen \neach time. So we can conclude that a glowing \nFuel gauge makes the reactor leak, while a rattling Helium tank \nmakes the Ignition explode and depletes the Oxygen levels. Once we know which two errors \nwe need to avoid, we can make a table \nand use the logic of cause and effect to see which thrusters trigger them. Since the Helium tank is fine \nduring the first test run when thrusters B and C are active, we can assume neither makes it rattle. And from the third run \nwe know that D and E don’t either. That leaves thruster A, which was indeed used \nin the second and fourth test runs where the Helium tank rattled. Now what causes the glowing Fuel gauge? From the fourth test run we know \nit can’t be thrusters A, D, or E. So is the culprit, B, C, \nor each of them separately? The answer can be found \nin the second and third test runs: the fuel tank glowed in both, \nbut B was activated in one, and C in the other. That means the B and C thrusters each \nindependently make the Fuel tank glow. It looks like the A, B, and C \nthrusters are off limits. Fortunately, the other two \nare just enough to clear the jump. You rocket into first place and the gang \nbegrudgingly hands over your uncle. He thanks you profusely, \nand decides to celebrate your victory with a cup of tea \nfrom his latest contraption..."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why do you have to win the race?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "to rescue your uncle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "to win the prize money"}, {"label": "C", "text": "to claim the throne of the wastelands"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which features are responsible for the malfunctions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The machine gun"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The coffeemaker"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The emergency thrusters"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these is NOT one of the deadly malfunctions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Exploding ignition"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cabin flooding"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Leaking reactor"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of these is NOT one of the intermediate malfunctions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Glowing fuel gauge"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rattling helium tank"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Incorrect time display"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the malfunctions don’t we have to worry about?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spinning gravitometer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Depleting oxygen levels"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Glowing fuel gauge"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Over a decade ago, I started a business straight out of uni\nwith my mate, Scott. Now, having no prior business experience and not really any grand plan -- in fact, our goals when we started were\nnot to have to get a real job (Laughter) and to not have to wear\na suit to work every day. Check and check. (Laughter) Today, we have thousands\nof amazing employees, and millions of people use\nour software around the planet. And technically, even outside the planet, if you count those that are currently\non their way to Mars. So you'd think that I know\nwhat I'm doing every day when I go to work. Well, let me let you in on something: most days, I still feel like\nI often don't know what I'm doing. I've felt that way for 15 years, and I've since learned that feeling\nis called \"impostor syndrome.\" Have you ever felt out of your depth, like a fraud, and just kind of guessed/bullshitted\nyour way through the situation -- (Laughter) petrified that anytime, someone was going to call you on it? Well, I can think of many examples\nwhere I felt like this. Interviewing our first HR manager, having never worked in a company\nthat had an HR department -- (Laughter) terrified as I walked into the interview, thinking, \"What am I going\nto ask this person?\" Or attending board meetings\nin a T-shirt surrounded by suits, and acronyms are flying around, feeling like a five-year-old as I surreptitiously write\nthem down in my notebook, so I can look them up on Wikipedia\nwhen I get home later. (Laughter) Or, in the early days, when people would call up\nand ask for accounts payable, I would freeze and think, \"Wait,\nare they asking for money or giving it to us?\" (Laughter) And I would cover the phone, cover the mouthpiece of the phone, and say, \"Scott, you're in accounts,\" and pass it across. (Laughter) We both did a lot of jobs back then. So for me, impostor syndrome is a feeling\nof being well, well out of your depth, yet already entrenched in the situation. Internally, you know you're not\nskilled enough, experienced enough or qualified enough\nto justify being there, yet you are there, and you have to figure a way out, because you can't just get out. It's not a fear of failure, and it's not a fear\nof being unable to do it. It's more a sensation\nof getting away with something, a fear of being discovered, that at any time, someone\nis going to figure this out. And if they did figure it out, you'd honestly think, \"Well,\nthat's fair enough, actually.\" (Laughter) One of my favorite writers,\nNeil Gaiman, put it so beautifully in a commencement address he gave\nat a university, called \"Make Good Art.\" I want to make sure\nI get his quote correct. \"I was convinced that there would be\na knock on the door, and a man with a clipboard would be there\nto tell me that it was all over, that they'd caught up with me, and that I would now have to go\nand get a real job.\" Now, when there's a knock on my door, I still feel like some sort of dark-suited\nclipboard man is going to be there to tell me that my time is kind of up. And being a crap cook, I'm quite relieved when it's just\nsomeone with a pizza for the kids. (Laughter) But it's important to note\nthat it's not all bad. There's a lot of goodness,\nI think, in those feelings. And this isn't some sort of\nmotivational-poster type talk, a \"Begin it now.\" It's more of an introspection into\nmy own experiences of impostor syndrome, and how I've tried\nto learn to harness them and turn them into some sort\nof a force for good. And a great example of those experiences is in the early days\nof Atlassian's history. We were about four years old,\nand we had about 70 employees. And at the advice of our auditors -- most good stories start\nwith advice from an auditor -- (Laughter) we entered the New South Wales\nEntrepreneur of the Year competition. Now, we were surprised when we won the New South Wales\nEntrepreneur of the Year in the young category\nfor entrepreneurs under 40. There were eight categories. And so surprised, in fact, having looked at the list of people\nwe were up against, I didn't even turn up\nto the awards ceremony. So Scott collected the gong by himself. And then we traveled off\nto the national awards. I thought I should probably\nturn up to those. So we rented some suits, I invited a girl that I had just met -- we'll get to her in a second -- (Laughter) and off we went to the big black-tie gala. Now, our surprise turned to shock in the first award of the night,\nthe young category, when we beat all of the other states and won the Australian\nYoung Entrepreneur of the Year. When the shock had worn off, we got a lot of champagne to the table\nand the party began, and the night was surely over. We were having a royally great time. Fast-forward to the last\naward of the night, and our shock turned\ninto everybody's shock when we won the Australian\nEntrepreneur of the Year against all of the other categories. Now, so shocked was\neverybody else, in fact, that the announcer,\nthe CEO of Ernst and Young, opened the envelope, and the first words out of his mouth\nwere, \"Oh my God.\" (Laughter) And then he reset himself\nand announced that we had won. (Laughter) So we knew we were in way too deep. And from there,\nthe water got a lot deeper, because we jetted off to Monte Carlo to represent Australia\nin the World Entrepreneur of the Year against 40 other different countries. Now, in another rented suit,\nI was at one of the dinners and sitting next to a lovely man\ncalled Belmiro de Azevedo, who was the winner from Portugal. Total champion. At 65, he had been running\nhis business for 40 years. He had 30,000 employees. Don't forget, at the time, we had 70. And he had four billion euro in turnover. And after a couple of wines, I remember admitting to him that I felt\nthat we did not deserve to be there, that we were well out of our depth, and at some time, someone\nwas going to figure this out and send us home to Australia. And he, I remember,\njust paused and looked at me and said that he felt exactly the same way and that he suspected all the winners\nwere feeling that way, and that despite not knowing Scott or I\nor really anything about technology, he said that we were obviously\ndoing something right and should probably just keep going. (Laughter) Now, this was a pretty big\nlight bulb moment for me for two reasons. One, I realized that\nother people felt this as well. And two, I realized it doesn't go away\nwith any form of success. I had assumed that successful people\ndidn't feel like frauds, and I now know that the opposite\nis more likely to be true. And this isn't just a feeling\nthat I have at work. It happens in my personal life, too. In the early days, I was flying back and forth\nto San Francisco every week for Atlassian, and I racked up a lot\nof frequent flyer points and got access to\nthe Qantas business lounge. Now, if there's ever a place\nthat I don't belong ... (Laughter) It doesn't help when I walk in and they\ngenerally look at me in shorts and jeans, or jeans and a T-shirt, and say,\n\"Can I help you, son? Are you lost?\" But anyway, sometimes life\nhappens in the Qantas lounge when you'd least expect it. One morning, over a decade ago, I was sitting there on\nmy regularly weekly commute, and a beautiful woman\nfrom way out of my league walked into the Qantas lounge\nand continued walking straight up to me in a case of mistaken identity. She thought I was someone else, so in this case, I actually\nwas an impostor. (Laughter) But rather than freeze\nas I would have historically done or chivalrously maybe\ninformed her of her error, I just tried to keep\nthe conversation going. (Laughter) And classic Australian bullshit\nbecame some sort of forward movement and a phone number. And I took that girl to the awards\nceremony a couple of months later. And more than a decade later, I'm incredibly happy\nthat she is now my wife, and we have four amazing\nchildren together. (Applause) But you'd think that when\nI wake up every morning, I wouldn't roll over and look at her\nand think, \"She's going to say, 'Who are you, and who gave you\nthat side of the bed?' (Laughter) 'Get out of here.'\" But she doesn't. And I think she sometimes\nfeels the same way. And apparently, that's one of the reasons that we'll likely have\na successful marriage. You see, in researching this talk, I learned that one of the attributes\nof the most successful relationships is when both partners\nfeel out of their league. They feel that their partner\nis out of their league. They feel like impostors. And if they don't freeze,\nand they're thankful, and they work harder and they stretch\nto be the best partner they can, it's likely to be a very\nsuccessful relationship. So if you have this feeling, don't freeze. Try to keep the conversation going, even if she thinks that you're\nsomebody that you're not. Now, feeling like, or people\nthinking I'm someone I'm not actually happens quite frequently. A great example from my more recent past, a few months ago, I was up\nlate at night with one of my kids, and I saw something on Twitter about Tesla saying that they could solve South Australia's rolling\nseries of power crises with one of their large\nindustrial batteries. Without thinking,\nI fired off a bunch of tweets, challenging them and saying\nwere they really serious about this. And in doing so, I managed\nto kick a very small rock off a very big hill that turned into an avalanche that I\nfound myself tumbling in the middle of. Because you see, a few hours later,\nElon tweeted me back and said that they were deadly serious, that within a hundred days\nof contract signing, they could install\na 100-megawatt-hour facility, which is a giant battery\nof a world-class size, one of the biggest\never made on the planet. And that's when all hell\nreally broke loose. Within 24 hours, I had\nevery major media outlet texting and emailing and trying\nto get in contact with me to get opinion as some sort of\n\"expert\" in energy. (Laughter) Now, at the time, I couldn't really\nhave told you the difference between a one-and-a-half-volt AA battery\nthat goes in my kids' toys and a 100-megawatt-hour\nindustrial-scale battery facility that goes in South Australia that could potentially\nsolve their power crisis. I was now feeling a chronic case\nof impostor syndrome, (Laughter) and it got truly bizarre. And I remember thinking to myself, \"Shit. I've kind of started something here\nand I can't really get out. If I abandon the situation, I'm going to sort of set back\nrenewables in Australia and maybe just look like a complete idiot because of my idiocy on Twitter.\" So I thought the only thing I could do was to try not to freeze\nand to try to learn. So I spent a week trying to learn everything I could\nabout industrial-scale batteries and the electricity grid and renewables\nand the economics of all of this and whether this was even\na feasible proposal. I talked to the chief scientist,\nI talked to the CSIRO, had multiple ministers and premiers\ntrying to give me their side of the story from both sides of the aisle. I managed to exchange\ntweets with the prime minister. I even managed to pull off\na passing impression, let's say, of an energy expert on ABC Lateline. (Laughter) But as a result of all this, South Australia did put out\na battery tender, and they had more than 90 applications\nfor that battery tender. And the national conversation\nover a period of a few months moved from the sort of theatrical\nlumps of coal in the parliament to discussing kind of which\nindustrial-scale battery chemistry was the best for building\nlarge-scale renewable batteries. So I think that the important lesson\nis by that time in my life, I knew well that I was an impostor. I knew I was miles out of my depth. But instead of freezing,\nI tried to learn as much as I could, motivated by my fear\nof generally looking like an idiot, and tried to turn that\ninto some sort of a force for good. So one of the things I've learned is that people think successful people\ndon't feel like frauds. But I think, especially\nknowing a lot of entrepreneurs, the opposite is more likely to be true. But the most successful people I know\ndon't question themselves, but they do heavily question,\nregularly question, their ideas and their knowledge. They know when the water is way too deep, and they're not afraid to ask for advice. They don't see that as a bad thing. And they use that advice\nto hone those ideas, to improve them and to learn. And it's OK to be\nout of your depth sometimes. I'm frequently out of my depth. It's OK to be out of your depth. It's OK to be in a situation where\nyou just can't push the eject button, so long as you don't freeze, so long as you harness the situation,\ndon't be paralyzed and try to turn it into\nsome sort of a force for good. And it's important\nthat I say \"harness\" here, because this isn't sort of\npop-psychology BS about conquering impostor syndrome for me. It's merely about being aware of it. In fact, I'm extremely aware\nof feeling like an impostor right now, as I'm up here, some sort of pseudo-expert on a feeling that I couldn't even\nput a name to a few months ago, when I agreed to do this talk. Which, if you think about it,\nis kind of the point, isn't it? (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

{"page": 16, "lesson": 4, "title": "The Tower of Epiphany | Think Like A Coder, Ep 7", "category": "Critical Thinking", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-tower-of-epiphany-think-like-a-coder-ep-7", "transcript": {"en": "Ethic and Hedge are on the ground floor \nof a massive tower. Barriers of energy separate them \nfrom their quest’s second goal: the Node of Creation. To reach it, Ethic must use \nthree energy streams to climb the tower. As soon as she steps forward a timer \nwill begin counting down from 60 seconds. At the back of the room \nthere’s a basin made of invisible towers that can hold energy between them. After one minute, a torrent of energy \nwill pour down from above, filling one unit at a time, with a force field preventing it \nfrom spilling out the front or back. During the 60 calm seconds, Ethic and Hedge must decide exactly \nhow many units of energy will fall. For each of the three challenges, they must choose the amount \nthat will fill the basin exactly. If they do so, the energy will propel them\nfurther upwards. But if they get the amount at all wrong, \nthe energy lift will fail, dropping them. Diagrams on the walls \nillustrate some examples. This configuration \nwill capture exactly 2 units of energy. This configuration will capture 4—\n3 here, and 1 here. And this one will also capture 4, because any energy on the right \nwould spill out. The energy will rain down in such a way that it’ll only overflow \nif there’s no space that could hold it. Hedge can make one tower of blocks visible\nat a time and count how tall it is, but he can’t look at \nthe whole structure all at once. How does Ethic program Hedge \nto figure out exactly how much energy \neach basin can hold? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Here’s one way of thinking about \nwhat’s happening: each unoccupied cell will hold energy if and only if there is a wall \neventually to its left, and a wall eventually to its right. But it would take a long time for Hedge \nto check this for each individual cell. So what if he were to consider \na whole column of blocks at a time? How many units of energy \ncan this hold, for instance? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Let’s analyze the problem \nby looking at our example. There are 5 columns of blocks here. The leftmost one can’t hold any energy, \nbecause there’s nothing higher than it. The 2nd stack can have 3 units above it, as they would be trapped \nbetween these two 4 block stacks. We get 3 units by taking the height \nwhere the energy would level off— 4, and subtracting the height of the stack— \nso that’s 4 minus 1. The 3rd stack is similar— 4 to the left,\n4 to the right, and it’s 3 high, so it’ll hold 4 minus 3 equals 1 unit. The 4th stack and 5th stacks have \nnothing higher than them to the right, so they can’t hold any energy. We can adapt this idea into an algorithm. Considering one column at a time \nas the point of reference, Hedge can look to the left stack by stack \nto find the height of the tallest one, look to the right to find the height \nof the tallest one, and take the smaller of the two \nas the height the energy can fill up to. If the result is higher than the column \nin question, subtract the height \nof the original column, and the result will be the number of units\nthat column can hold. If it's equal to or below the level \nof the column in question, the energy would spill off. Hedge can apply that \nto an entire basin with a loop that starts on the left-most column \nand moves right, one column at a time. For each column, he’ll run the same steps—\nlook all the way left for the tallest, do the same to the right, \ntake the lower height of the two, subtract the original column height, and increase the grand total \nif that number is positive. His loop will repeat \nas many times as there are columns. That will work, but it’ll take a long time\nfor a large basin. At every step Hedge repeats the action \nof looking left and looking right. If there are N stacks, \nhe’ll look at all N stacks N times. Is there a faster way? Here’s one time saver: \nbefore doing anything else, Hedge can start on the left, and keep a running tally \nof what the highest stack is. Here that would be 2, 2 again,\nsince the first was higher, then 4, 4, 4. He can then find \nthe highest right-most stacks by doing the same going right-to-left: \n1, 3, 4, 4, 4. In the end he’ll have a table \nlike this in his memory. Now, Hedge can take one more pass \nto calculate how much energy there will be above every stack \nwith the same equation from before: take the smaller of the stored left \nand right values, and subtract the height \nof the current tower. Instead of looking at N stacks N times, \nhe’ll look at N stacks just 3 times— which is what’s called linear time. There are ways to optimize \nthe solution even further, but this is good enough for our heroes. Ethic and Hedge work as one. The first cascade is a breeze, \nand they rise up the tower. The second is a little tougher. The third is huge, \nwith dozens of stacks of blocks. The timer ticks down towards zero, \nbut Ethic’s program is fast. She gets the wheel in position \njust in time, and the energy lifts them \nto the Node of Creation. Like the first, it reveals a vision: \nmemories of years gone by. The world machine changed everything, and Ethic, in her position \nas chief robotics engineer, grew troubled by what she saw. When the Bradbarrier went up \nto keep the people in, she knew something was seriously wrong. So she created three artifacts with the ability to restore people’s \npower, creativity, and memory, and smuggled them to three communities. Before she could tell people \nhow to use them, the government discovered her efforts \nand sent bots to arrest her and the other programmers. The last thing Ethic \nused the world machine to create was a robot that would protect \nthe ancient device from the forces of ignorance \nby enclosing it in a giant maze. She named her creation Hedge. Without warning, the energy lift flickers,\nthen fizzles out."}, "multiple-choice": []}

These are all examples of relative risk, a common way risk \nis presented in news articles. Risk evaluation is a complicated tangle \nof statistical thinking and personal preference. One common stumbling block \nis the difference between relative risks like these \nand what are called absolute risks. Risk is the likelihood \nthat an event will occur. It can be expressed \nas either a percentage— for example, that heart attacks \noccur in 11% of men between the ages of 60 and 79— or as a rate— that one in two million \ndivers along Australia’s western coast will suffer a fatal shark bite each year. These numbers express \nthe absolute risk of heart attacks and shark attacks in these groups. Changes in risk can be expressed \nin relative or absolute terms. For example, a review in 2009 \nfound that mammography screenings reduced the number of breast cancer deaths\nfrom five women in one thousand to four. The absolute risk reduction \nwas about .1%. But the relative risk reduction \nfrom 5 cases of cancer mortality to four is 20%. Based on reports of this higher number, people overestimated \nthe impact of screening. To see why the difference between \nthe two ways of expressing risk matters, let’s consider \nthe hypothetical example of a drug that reduces heart attack risk by 40%. Imagine that out of a group \nof 1,000 people who didn’t take the new drug, \n10 would have heart attacks. The absolute risk \nis 10 out of 1,000, or 1%. If a similar group of 1,000 people \ndid take the drug, the number of heart attacks would be six. In other words, the drug could prevent \nfour out of ten heart attacks— a relative risk reduction of 40%. Meanwhile, the absolute risk \nonly dropped from 1% to 0.6%— but the 40% relative risk decrease \nsounds a lot more significant. Surely preventing \neven a handful of heart attacks, or any other negative outcome, \nis worthwhile— isn’t it? Not necessarily. The problem is that choices \nthat reduce some risks can put you in the path of others. Suppose the heart-attack drug caused \ncancer in one half of 1% of patients. In our group of 1,000 people, four heart attacks \nwould be prevented by taking the drug, but there would be \nfive new cases of cancer. The relative reduction \nin heart attack risk sounds substantial and the absolute risk of cancer \nsounds small, but they work out \nto about the same number of cases. In real life, everyone’s individual evaluation of risk \nwill vary depending on \ntheir personal circumstances. If you know you have a family history \nof heart disease you might be more strongly motivated \nto take a medication that would lower your heart-attack risk, even knowing it provided \nonly a small reduction in absolute risk. Sometimes, we have to decide between \nexposing ourselves to risks that aren’t directly comparable. If, for example, the heart attack drug \ncarried a higher risk of a debilitating, \nbut not life-threatening, side effect like migraines \nrather than cancer, our evaluation of whether that risk \nis worth taking might change. And sometimes there isn’t necessarily \na correct choice: some might say even a minuscule risk \nof shark attack is worth avoiding, because all you’d miss out on \nis an ocean swim, while others wouldn’t even consider \nskipping a swim to avoid an objectively tiny risk \nof shark attack. For all these reasons, \nrisk evaluation is tricky at baseline, and reporting on risk can be misleading, especially when it shares some numbers \nin absolute terms and others in relative terms. Understanding how these measures work will help you cut through \nsome of the confusion and better evaluate risk."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In November 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that a daily portion of 50 g of processed meat, such as sausage, is associated with an increased life-long risk of colon cancer of 18%.

They came from Scandinavia \nin Northern Europe but would travel far and wide. Some plundered and settled \nin the British Isles and France; others braved Artic exploration or forged clever new trade routes \nto the Middle East. With their steely navigational skills, \nadvanced long-ships and fearsome tactics, the Vikings sustained their seafaring \nfor over three hundred years. But for all their might, \nthey left few monuments. Instead, fragments of stone, \nbark, and bone provide the keys to their culture. Found in graves, bogs, \nand sites of ancient settlements, many of these objects are inscribed with messages in Old Norse \nwritten in runic letters. But the Vikings also scratched runes\ninto household goods, jewellery, weapons, and even shoes. Deciphering these messages \nis no easy task. Runes are short, straight, \nand diagonal lines that make up an alphabet \ncalled the “futhark.” All classes of people spoke and wrote \nthis language, in many different dialects. There was no standard spelling, \nthey wrote the individual runic letters by pronouncing the sounds \nof their regional accents. Some of these inscriptions also bore \nthe influence of other cultures the Vikings interacted with— the runic inscription “love conquers all,”\nfor example, is originally a Latin phrase \nfrom the poet Virgil. Many, like the enigmatic Rok runestone, \nwere carved in verse, highlighting the tradition \nof Old Norse poetry. So even though modern runologists \ncan read runes, their meaning isn’t always obvious. Still, in spite of the remaining \nmysteries, many inscriptions memorializing the dead and recording local histories \nhave been deciphered— along with some \ncontaining magical incantations. The Ramsund runes in Sweden are carved \non a rocky outcrop beside a bridge for travelers passing over swampy ground. This causeway was commissioned \nby a prominent local woman named Sigríðr. She proclaimed both her importance \nand her family’s power by carving their names in stone, and even associated herself \nand her family with mythical heroism by carving illustrations of Sigurd \nthe dragon slayer. In the town of Jelling in Denmark, two standing stones from the 10th century memorialize different generations\nof a royal family. The first was erected by King Gorm the Old\nin memory of his Queen Thyrvi, and the second by their son, \nHarald Bluetooth, after Gorm’s death. The stones announce the power \nof this Viking Age dynasty, and they are among the earliest historical\ndocuments of Denmark. They indicate that Denmark \nwas the earliest major Viking Age kingdom, by telling that Harald controlled \nsouthern Norway, and that he converted to Christianity. Today, Harald Bluetooth’s initials \nmake up the Bluetooth logo. The 10th century warrior poet Egil \nwas a well-known carver of runes. According to poetic accounts, he once \ncarved runes on a horn filled with poison, causing the horn to shatter. In another story, Egil saves a young girl’s life \nby placing a piece of whale bone carved with healing runes \nunder her pillow. Norse poetry tells of runic spells, \ncast to ensure calm seas, safe childbirth and triumphant battles. But the exact nature of these spells \nisn’t fully understood— many of the inscriptions on swords,\naxes, and spears are indecipherable. Other objects, like the Lindholm amulet, have inscriptions that could be \nincantations, riddles, or religious messages. While it’s difficult to pinpoint the end\nof the Viking era, by 1100 CE their sea-borne expansion \nhad mostly come to an end. However, people continued to speak \nversions of Old Norse throughout Scandinavia; and runes remained in use in rural areas\ninto the 19th century. Today, many runestones remain standing \nat their original sites. The inscription on the Danish Glavendrup\nstone has fearsomely declared \nfor a thousand years: “A warlock be he who damages this stone\nor drags it in memory of another!”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What language did the Vikings speak?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Celtic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Germanic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Futhark"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Linear B"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "True or false: the Viking language doesn’t have a standard spelling?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A prominent local woman named Sigríðr drew illustrations of Sigurd the dragon slayer on the _______runestone.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rok"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ramsund"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Jelling"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The earliest major Viking age kingdom was organized in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Norway"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Denmark"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Finland"}, {"label": "D", "text": "France"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The Vikings’ sea-borne expansion mostly came to an end by", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1350CE"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1100CE"}, {"label": "C", "text": "750CE"}, {"label": "D", "text": "350CE"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

He quickly inserted \na needle into his arm, withdrew his own blood, \nand transferred it to her. After a few uncertain minutes, \nshe began to recover. Halsted didn’t know \nhow lucky they’d gotten. His transfusion only worked \nbecause he and his sister happened to have the same blood type— something that isn’t guaranteed, \neven among close relatives. Blood types hadn’t been discovered \nby Halsted’s time, though people had been experimenting \nwith transfusions for centuries— mostly unsuccessfully. In 1667, a French physician \nnamed Jean-Baptiste Denis became the first to try the technique \non a human. Denis transfused sheep’s blood \ninto Antoine Mauroy, a man likely suffering from psychosis, in the hopes that it would reduce \nhis symptoms. Afterward, Mauroy was in good spirits. But after a second transfusion, \nhe developed a fever, severe pain in his lower back, \nintense burning in his arm, and he urinated a thick, black liquid. Though nobody knew it at the time, these were the signs of a dangerous \nimmune response unfolding inside his body. This immune response starts \nwith the production of proteins called antibodies, which distinguish the body’s \nown cells from intruders. They do so by recognizing \nthe foreign proteins, or antigens, embedded in an intruder’s \ncell membrane. Antibodies latch onto the antigens, signaling other immune cells to attack \nand destroy the foreign cells. The destroyed cells are flushed \nfrom the body in urine. In extreme cases, \nthe massive break down of cells causes clots in the bloodstream that \ndisrupt the flow of blood to vital organs, overload the kidneys, \nand cause organ failure. Fortunately, Denis’s patient \nsurvived the transfusion. But, after other cross-species \ntransfusions proved fatal, the procedure was outlawed across Europe, falling out of favor \nfor several centuries. It wasn’t until 1901 \nthat Austrian physician Karl Landsteiner discovered blood types, the crucial step in the success \nof human to human blood transfusions. He noticed that when different types \nwere mixed together, they formed clots. This happens when antibodies \nlatch on to cells with foreign antigens, causing blood cells to clump together. But if the donor cells are the same \nblood type as the recipient’s cells, the donor cells won’t be flagged \nfor destruction, and won’t form clumps. By 1907, doctors were mixing together small amounts\nof blood before transfusing it. If there were no clumps, \nthe types were a match. This enabled them \nto save thousands of lives, laying the foundation \nfor modern transfusions. Up to this point, all transfusions \nhad occurred in real time, directly between two individuals. That’s because blood \nbegins to clot almost immediately after coming into contact with air— a defense mechanism to prevent \nexcessive blood loss after injury. In 1914, researchers discovered \nthat the chemical sodium citrate stopped blood coagulating by removing \nthe calcium necessary for clot formation. Citrated blood could be stored \nfor later use— the first step in making large scale \nblood transfusions possible. In 1916, a pair of American scientists \nfound an even more effective anticoagulant called heparin, which works by \ndeactivating enzymes that enable clotting. We still use heparin today. At the same time, American and British researchers \ndeveloped portable machines that could transport donor blood \nonto the battlefields of World War I. Combined with \nthe newly-discovered heparin, medics safely stored \nand preserved liters of blood, wheeling it directly onto the battlefield \nto transfuse wounded soldiers. After the war, this crude portable box \nwould become the inspiration for the modern-day blood bank, \na fixture of hospitals around the world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many ABO blood types did Karl Landsteiner and his coworkers eventually discover?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Three"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Four"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Five"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eight"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Antigens are", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Proteins produced by the immune system to combat intruders like bacteria or foreign cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bacteria or cells that can enter the body and cause medical problems"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Proteins imbedded in the cell membranes of intruders like bacteria or foreign cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Different blood types that can cause problems if transfused into the wrong person"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why were the first successful transfusions limited to real time procedures between donor and recipient?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because donor blood quickly clots when removed from the body"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because it enabled physicians to quickly transfuse more blood if it was needed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "So that they could give the donor and recipient sodium citrate if it was needed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because blood could only be transfused between family members"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Antibodies are", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Proteins produced by the immune system to combat intruders like bacteria or foreign cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bacteria or cells that can enter the body and cause medical problems"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Proteins imbedded in the cell membranes of intruders like bacteria or foreign cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Different blood types that can cause problems if transfused into the wrong person"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why did sheep blood recipient Antoine Mauroy develop pain in his lower back?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because the transfused blood caused muscle cramps in his back"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because bacteria in the transfused blood had likely caused a urinary tract infection"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because blood clots and destroyed red blood cells disrupted the function of his kidneys"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because antibodies in the sheep blood reacted with antigens in Mauroy’s back and kidneys"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

"transcript": {"en": "[Music] good evening so look at me see me tell me what do you see [Music] [Laughter] participation yes I am a triple e an educator and entrepreneur and engineer I'm a mathematician I'm an analyst I'm a manager to a team of cyber security engineers I am Nesby one of Nesbo's DFW hidden figures I am a congressional Award recipient u.s. congressional war recipient I am all of these things but when I asked you to see me is that what you see so I went to college and I had to read this book it was called Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison maybe you know about it now don't ask me anything I could not tell you the details of that book because it was so long ago when I read it but two distinct quotes stood out to me and the first one is this one I am invisible understand simply because people refuse to see me when they approach me they see my surroundings themselves or figments of their imagination indeed anything and everything except for me so it's the second day of class and I am a professor of this higher-level math and a lot of students didn't believe that I could be the actual professor of this class I was young in my early 20s at the time after he de cámara african-american and female and I was counseling a student and so I could see out of the corner of my eye a student waiting to talk to the professor so when I finished talking to student ID through counseling he walks away and the waiting student does not walk to me he walks to the student that I've been talking to and proceeded to ask him questions about the class and so I found it funny and I just stood to the side and just kind of smiled but this interchange went on for maybe five minutes and then the student I had been counselor said you know dude I'm not the professor she is the professor of the class you need to be asking those questions of her and then you should have seen the look on this guy's face he could not believe that I was actually the professor of this math class he thought it was a joke but now I look back on that incident and I wonder why didn't I correct him when he initially approached why did I allow that interchange to go on for as long as it did I was engulfed at that time in this curse of invisibility I found the situation funny I found it humorous and I laughed at it then but had I known that that error would manifest itself throughout my career as an educator and entrepreneur and an engineer I would have taken it a little bit more serious because I know I could analyze that code I know I could solve that problem I know I could do all those things but I always felt throughout my career as I had to perform some type of trick I had to yell to be seen trying constantly to remain visible so you know about this movie it came out last year over the summer it's hidden figures and when it first came out I don't know why I was hesitating I didn't go see it but a lot of people in my circle a lot of my friends a lot of my family a lot of my peers a lot of my co-workers they all would tell me the same thing they saw this movie and it reminded them of me I would get im's on social media I would get texts just all around saying this movie reminds me of you so I don't know why I waited so long to go see the movie but I'll get truly I want to saw it and you know what that movie reminded me of myself and I cried through the entire thing because Miss Catherine Miss Dorothy and Miss Mary all those things that they had gone through all their slights all of the times of being invisible I had also experienced and it just it just teared me up and so cried through the whole movie and get to the credits I'm in the car and I stopped crying and I got mad and I was mad at myself because I asked myself why didn't I know about these women why didn't I know about their contributions they were invisible to me and that frustrated me because I felt that I should have known so I started looking up some statistics and these are women in stem and I was curious to know how many women are in stem now science technology engineering and math how many are in this stem careers so this is a 2015 statistic from the National Science Foundation and as you can see there is a small percentage of women in 2015 that are taken apart in these STEM careers and don't even add women of color then the percentage drops significantly and so I begin thinking again so I know these women when did it start are they feeling invisible this artists young girls were they feeling invisible in their STEM subjects and so I found another statistic from the Girl Scouts and 57% of girls won't even consider a career in the STEM fields so I'm wondering why is that why is it that so many people young girls specifically why aren't they considering careers in stem so I bought back on another incident in my life and this is goes back to the seventh grade it's a seventh grade biology class and so I've been preparing for this biology test and I studied really really hard I studied really hard and I ended up making a hundred on that biology test and I was proud yes I was proud of that hundred I was proud and but back then young girls we weren't supposed to be smart especially in the subjects where I excelled were math and the sciences it was okay for us to be cute but it wasn't okay for us to be smart and so I've made that hundred but the teacher didn't believe I deserved that hundred they thought I cheated so they made me take the test again and you know what guess what I made another hundred and so I thought in my mind I'm like every time you give me this test I'd studied for it I am gonna make a 100 that's the first thought but then the second thought was why bother if my intelligence is always going to be challenged if I'm always going to be challenged every time why even do it so you know what I did I made myself invisible I did just enough to get a good grade but I stopped doing more to stand out and so I'm wondering is that's what's happened to these young girls who are excelling in these subjects they're they like them but they're not supposed to be smart in these STEM subjects are they be encouraged or are there saying no you can't do that no I don't I don't believe you what's what's going on so I thought how do we break that curse of invisibility what can you do so for me it took an internal realization that I matter what I say say matters what I do matter I know what I know and I stopped jumping through those hoops I dared people to see me and I began to be bold in the knowledge that I had so those are the three things that I have here on the screen that I said you can do to break the curse the first one is be bold it is okay there are millions of young women young ladies older women who are proficient in the STEM careers science technology engineering and math and you can be cute you can be athletic you can be smart you can be all these things you don't have to be in that one box be bold they're people to see you there are people to challenge you be so visible that if they're forced to see you want to be you and want to be where you are embrace embrace your passion especially is in the STEM careers like I skip saying it's okay embrace especially the subjects just was not supposed to be good in I did enough to support others comfort for a long time and I can tell you you will not be happy supporting someone else's comfort embrace where you are and finally no fear being invisible allows you to hide don't don't be afraid so I mentioned before the Ralph Ellison Invisible Man book two quotes and here's the second one I was searching for myself and asking everyone sent myself questions in which I and only I could answer it took me a long time to come to the realization which seems like everybody else has been born with that I am nobody but myself so invisibility is a choice choose to be seen choose to be heard choose your stem career if this your stem career choose to be thank you [Applause] [Music]"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 16, "lesson": 9, "title": "Epic Engineering: Building the Brooklyn Bridge - Alex Gendler", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/epic-engineering-building-the-brooklyn-bridge-alex-gendler", "transcript": {"en": "In the mid-19th century, suspension bridges \nwere collapsing all across Europe. Their industrial cables \nfrayed during turbulent weather and snapped \nunder the weight of their decks. So when a German-American engineer \nnamed John Roebling proposed building the largest \nand most expensive suspension bridge ever conceived \nover New York’s East River, city officials \nwere understandably skeptical. But Manhattan \nwas increasingly overcrowded, and commuters from Brooklyn \nclogged the river. In February of 1867, the government \napproved Roebling’s proposal. To avoid the failures \nof European bridges, Roebling designed \na hybrid bridge model. From suspension bridges, he incorporated large cables supported by \ncentral pillars and anchored at each bank. This design was ideal \nfor supporting long decks, which hung from smaller vertical cables. But Roebling’s model \nalso drew from cable-stayed bridges. These shorter structures \nheld up their decks with diagonal cables that ran directly to support towers. By adding these additional cables, \nRoebling improved the bridge’s stability, while also reducing the weight \non its anchor cables. Similar designs had been used \nfor some other bridges but the scope of Roebling’s plan here\ndwarfed them all. His new bridge’s deck\nspanned over 480 meters— 1.5 times longer than any previously built\nsuspension bridge. Since standard hemp rope \nwould tear under the deck’s 14,680 tons, his proposal called for \nover 5,600 kilometers of metal wire to create the bridge’s cables. To support all this weight, the towers would need to stand \nover 90 meters above sea level— making them the tallest structures \nin the Western Hemisphere. Roebling was confident \nhis design would work, but while surveying the site in 1869, an incoming boat \ncrushed his foot against the dock. Within a month, \ntetanus had claimed his life. Fortunately, John Roebling's son, \nWashington, was also a trained engineer and took over his father’s role. The following year, construction \non the tower foundations finally began. This first step in construction \nwas also the most challenging. Building on the rocky river bed involved \nthe use of a largely untested technology: pneumatic caissons. Workers lowered these airtight \nwooden boxes into the river, where a system of pipes pumped \npressurized air in and water out. Once established, air locks \nallowed workers to enter the chamber and excavate the river bottom. They placed layers of stone \non top of the caisson as they dug. When it finally hit the bedrock, \nthey filled it with concrete, becoming the tower’s \npermanent foundation. Working conditions in these caissons \nwere dismal and dangerous. Lit only by candles and gas lamps, \nthe chambers caught fire several times, forcing them to be evacuated and flooded. Even more dangerous was \na mysterious ailment called \"the bends.\" Today, we understand this \nas decompression sickness, but at the time, it appeared to be \nan unexplainable pain or dizziness that killed several workmen. In 1872, it nearly claimed the life \nof the chief engineer. Washington survived, \nbut was left paralyzed and bedridden. Yet once again, \nthe Roeblings proved indomitable. Washington’s wife Emily \nnot only carried communications between her husband and the engineers, but soon took over \nday-to-day project management. Unfortunately, \nthe bridge’s troubles were far from over. By 1877, construction was over budget \nand behind schedule. Worse still, it turned out \nthe bridge’s cable contractor had been selling them faulty wires. This would have been a fatal flaw \nif not for the abundant failsafes in John Roebling’s design.

They drift onto a petri dish, \nand when they land, they germinate a medical revolution. This lab belongs to Alexander Fleming, \na Scottish scientist investigating the properties \nof infectious bacteria. At this time, \nFleming is away on vacation. When he returns, he finds \na colony of mold growing on a petri dish he’d forgotten to place in his incubator. And around this colony of mold \nis a zone completely and unexpectedly \nclear of bacteria. In studying this mysterious phenomenon, Fleming came to realize that the mold \nwas secreting some kind of compound that was killing the bacteria. The mold was a species \nin the Penicillium genus, so Fleming dubbed \nthe antibacterial compound “penicillin.” What Fleming stumbled upon \nwas a microbial defense system. The penicillium mold \nconstantly produces penicillin in order to defend itself from threats, such as nearby bacterial colonies \nthat might consume its resources. Penicillin destroys \nmany types of bacteria by disrupting synthesis \nof their cell walls. These walls get their strength \nfrom a thick, protective mesh of sugars and amino acids, that are constantly being \nbroken down and rebuilt. Penicillin binds to one of the compounds \nthat weaves this mesh together and prevents the wall from being \nreconstructed at a critical phase. Meanwhile, penicillin stimulates \nthe release of highly reactive molecules that cause additional damage. Eventually, the cell’s structure \nbreaks down completely. This two-pronged attack \nis lethal to a wide range of bacteria, whether in petri-dishes, \nour bodies, or elsewhere. It’s not, however, \nharmful to our own cells, because those don’t have cell walls. For a decade or so \nafter Fleming’s discovery, penicillin remained \na laboratory curiosity. But during World War II, researchers figured out how to isolate \nthe active compound and grow the mold in larger quantities. They then went on to win \nthe Nobel Prize for their work. Teams at Oxford and several American \ndrug companies continued development, and within a few years \nit was commercially available. Penicillin and similar compounds quickly \ntransformed the treatment of infections. For the time being, they remain some of the most important, \nlife-saving antibiotics used in medicine. However, the more we use any antibiotic, \nthe more bacteria evolve resistance to it. In the case of penicillin, some bacteria produce compounds \nthat can break down the key structure that interferes with cell wall synthesis. As antibiotic use has increased, more and more bacteria \nhave evolved this defense, making these antibiotics ineffective against a growing number \nof bacterial infections. This means it’s essential that doctors \nnot overprescribe the drug. Meanwhile, 5 to 15% of patients \nin developed countries self-identify as allergic to penicillin, making it the most commonly reported \ndrug allergy. However, the vast majority— over 90%—\nof people who think they’re allergic \nto penicillin actually are not. Why the misperception? Many patients acquire the allergy label \nas children, when a rash appears after they’re treated \nfor an infection with penicillin or closely related drugs. The rash is often blamed on penicillin, while the more likely culprit \nis the original infection, or a reaction between the infection \nand the antibiotic. However, genuine penicillin allergies, where our immune systems \nmistake penicillin for an attacker, do occur rarely \nand can be very dangerous. So if you think you’re allergic \nbut don’t know for sure, your best bet is to visit an allergist. They’ll complete an evaluation \nthat’ll confirm whether or not you have the allergy. Even if you do have a penicillin allergy, your immune cells that react to the drug \nmay lose their ability to recognize it. In fact, about 80% of people \nwho are allergic to penicillin outgrow their allergy \nwithin ten years. This is great news for people \nwho currently identify as allergic to penicillin; the drug may one day save their lives, \nas it has done for so many others."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "From what source is penicillin derived?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The penicillium plant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A rogue bacterial species"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The mold penicillium"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Through a fermentation process"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who discovered penicillin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Alexander Fleming"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Jonas Salk"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Louis Pasteur"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Edward Jenner"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What part of bacteria does penicillin break down?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Protein"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mitochondria"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The cell wall"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The nucleus"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What renders penicillin not effective against infections?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bacterial resistance"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mold spores"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Carbon dioxide"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Prolonged exposure to sunlight"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What percentage of patients who think they are allergic to penicillin will tolerate the drug?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "75%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "90%"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

By the time you and the other monks \narrive on the scene, you know you have a disaster \non your hands. Overnight, four young apprentices \nbroke into the temple’s inner chamber to steal the sacred element crystals. But when the alarm went off \nthey panicked, and each of them swallowed the crystal \nthey held right before they were caught. With no idea how to control \nthe crystals’ vast powers, they’ll soon transform \ninto uncontrollable elemental spirits. Improbably enough, the old monk next to you \nhas seen something similar happen before. He explains: \n“You must determine who ate which crystal and get each into the proper containment \nfield before they transform. The elements compel their masters: those who ate the Earth and Water Crystals\nmust speak the truth, while those who consumed Fire and Air \nmust lie.\" The youths are too scared to confess \ntheir own transgressions. Instead, they fall to accusing each other. “Rikku took the Water crystal!” \nSumi blurts out. Rikku interrupts angrily. “It was Bella, \nshe stole the Fire crystal!” So Bella yells: \n“Jonah ate the Air crystal, I saw him!” Jonah looks up timidly \nand shakes his head. “I… I don’t know what happened, \nbut Sumi doesn’t have the Earth crystal.” So who ate which crystal? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. There’s no getting around it— \nthis will take some trial and error. But that’s not a bad thing. If we make a wrong guess, we’ll eventually reach a point where \nour conclusions contradict each other. That would allow us to confirm \nthat our initial guess was wrong and work from there. This is a technique \nknown as proof by contradiction. The trick is in being strategic \nabout where we begin our guessing. Some assumptions \nmight not lead to contradictions without making further assumptions. We want to pick one that creates \nthe most constraints on its own, and thus gives us the most information \nwhen it turns out to be right or wrong. Take, for example, Sumi’s statement. If we assume she’s telling the truth, we’d know the identity \nof both truth tellers. Rikku would have the Water crystal, \nand since she’s not lying about him, Sumi would have Earth. So Bella would have the Fire crystal, \nas Rikku says. But then Bella would have to be lying \nabout Jonah having the Air crystal. And yet that’s the only remaining option. This is a contradiction, and it tells us \nour initial assumption was wrong. So now we can go back to the start, but with the added knowledge \nthat Sumi is lying. As a liar, Sumi \nmust either have the Fire or Air crystal. That means Jonah \nwas telling the truth about her, so he can’t have taken either of those. And that means Bella was lying about him, so she must also have either Fire or Air. Since Sumi was lying, \nRikku can’t have taken the Water crystal— the only one left \nwho could have it is Jonah. And because we’ve already identified \nthe two liars, Rikku must have the Earth crystal. That means Bella has the Fire crystal \nand Sumi has Air.

Hailing from the West African nation \nof Burkina Faso— then known as Upper Volta— the 22-year-old soldier \nhad travelled to Madagascar to study at their military academy. But upon arriving, \nhe found a nation in conflict. Local revolutionaries \nsought to wrest control of Madagascar from France’s lingering colonial rule. These protestors \ninspired Sankara to read works by socialist leaders\nlike Karl Marx and seek wisdom from military strategy. When he returned to Upper Volta in 1973, Sankara was determined to free \nhis country from its colonial legacy. Born in 1949, Sankara was raised \nin a relatively privileged household as the third of ten children. His parents wanted him to be a priest, \nbut like many of his peers, Sankara saw the military \nas the perfect institution to rid Upper Volta of corruption. After returning from Madagascar, he became famous for his charisma \nand transparent oratorial style— but he was less popular \nwith the reigning government. Led by President Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, this administration came to power \nin the 3rd consecutive coup d’état in Upper Volta’s recent history. The administration’s policies \nwere a far cry from the sweeping changes \nSankara proposed, but, by 1981, \nSankara’s popularity won out, earning him a role \nin Ouédraogo’s government. Nicknamed “Africa’s Che Guevara,\" \nSankara rapidly rose through the ranks, and within two years, \nhe was appointed Prime Minister. In his new role, \nhe delivered rallying speeches to impoverished communities, \nwomen, and young people. He even tried to persuade \nother governments to form alliances based on their shared colonial legacy. But Ouédraogo and his advisors \nfelt threatened by Sankara’s new position. They thought his communist beliefs would \nharm alliances with capitalist countries, and just months \nafter becoming Prime Minister, Ouédraogo’s administration \nforced Sankara from the job and placed him on house arrest. Little did the President know this act would fuel Upper Volta’s \n4th coup d’état in 17 years. Civilian protests \nensued around the capital, and the government ground to a halt while Sankara tried to negotiate \na peaceful transition. During this time, Blaise Compaoré, Sankara’s friend \nand fellow former soldier, foiled another coup that included \nan attempt on Sankara’s life. Eventually, Ouédraogo resigned \nwithout further violence, and on August 4, 1983, Thomas Sankara \nbecame the new President of Upper Volta. Finally in charge, \nSankara launched an ambitious program for social and economic change. As one of his first agenda items, \nhe renamed the country from its French colonial title \n\"Upper Volta\" to \"Burkina Faso,\" which translates \nto “Land of Upright Men.\" Over the next four years he established \na nation-wide literacy campaign, ordered the planting \nof over 10 million trees, and composed a new national anthem— all while cutting down \ninflated government employee salaries. But perhaps the most unique element \nof Sankara’s revolution was his dedication to gender equality. He cultivated a movement \nfor women’s liberation, outlawing forced marriages, \npolygamy and genital mutilation. He was the first African leader to appoint\nwomen to key political positions and actively recruit them to the military. However, Sankara’s socialist policies \nwere met with much resistance. Many students and elites \nbelieved his economic plans would alienate Burkina Faso \nfrom its capitalist peers. His crackdown \non the misuse of public funds turned government officials \nagainst him as well. After four years, \nwhat began as an empowering revolution had isolated many influential Burkinabes. But Sankara was not ready \nto yield his power. He executed \nincreasingly authoritarian actions, including banning trade unions \nand the free press. Eventually, his autocratic tendencies turned even his closest friends \nagainst him. On October 15, 1987, Sankara was conducting a meeting \nwhen a group of assailants swarmed his headquarters. Sankara was assassinated in the attack, and many believe the raid was ordered \nby his friend Blaise Compaoré. Though his legacy is complicated, many of Sankara’s policies have proven \nthemselves to be ahead of their time. In the past decade, Burkinabe youth have celebrated \nSankara’s political philosophy, and nearby countries like Ghana have even \nadopted Sankara’s economic models.

{"page": 16, "lesson": 13, "title": "The paradox of efficiency - Edward Tenner", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-paradox-of-efficiency-edward-tenner", "transcript": {"en": "Who doesn't love efficiency? I do. Efficiency means more for less. More miles per gallon,\nmore light per watt, more words per minute. More for less is the next best thing to something for nothing. Algorithms, big data, the cloud\nare giving us more for less. Are we heading toward\na friction-free utopia or toward a nightmare of surveillance? I don't know. My interest is in the present. And I'd like to show you how the past can help us\nunderstand the present. There's nothing that summarizes both the promise\nand the danger of efficiency like the humble potato. The potato originated in the Andes and it spread to Europe\nfrom the ancient Inca. The potato is a masterpiece\nof balanced nutrition. And it had some very powerful friends. King Frederick the Great of Prussia was the first enthusiast. He believed that the potato could help increase the population\nof healthy Prussians. And the more healthy Prussians, the more healthy Prussian soldiers. And some of those\nhealthy Prussian soldiers captured a French military\npharmacist named Parmentier. Parmentier, at first, was appalled by the morning, noon and night diet fed to POWs of potatoes, but he came to enjoy it. He thought they were making\nhim a healthier person. And so, when he was released, he took it on himself\nto spread the potato to France. And he had some powerful friends. Benjamin Franklin\nadvised him to hold a banquet, at which every dish included potatoes. And Franklin was a guest of honor. Even the king and queen of France were persuaded to wear potatoes, potato flowers, pardon me. (Laughter) The king wore a potato\nflower in his lapel, and the queen wore\na potato flower in her hair. That was a truly great\npublic relations idea. But there was a catch. The potato was too efficient\nfor Europe's good. In Ireland, it seemed a miracle. Potatoes flourished, the population grew. But there was a hidden risk. Ireland's potatoes\nwere genetically identical. They were a very efficient breed,\ncalled the Lumper. And the problem with the Lumper was that a blight from South America that affected one potato would affect them all. Britain's exploitation\nand callousness played a role, but it was because of this monoculture that a million people died and another two million\nwere forced to emigrate. A plant that was supposed to end famine created one of the most tragic ones. The problems of efficiency today are less drastic but more chronic. They can also prolong the evils that they were intended to solve. Take the electronic medical records. It seemed to be the answer\nto the problem of doctors' handwriting, and it had the benefit of providing much better data\nfor treatments. In practice, instead, it has meant much more electronic paperwork and physicians are now complaining\nthat they have less, rather than more time\nto see patients individually. The obsession with efficiency\ncan actually make us less efficient. Efficiency also bites back\nwith false positives. Hospitals have hundreds\nof devices registering alarms. Too often, they're crying wolf. It takes time to rule those out. And that time results in fatigue,\nstress and, once more, the neglect of the problems\nof real patients. There are also false positives\nin pattern recognition. A school bus, viewed from the wrong angle, can resemble a punching bag. So precious time is required to eliminate misidentification. False negatives are a problem, too. Algorithms can learn a lot -- fast. But they can tell us only about the past. So many future classics\nget bad reviews, like \"Moby Dick,\" or are turned down\nby multiple publishers, like the \"Harry Potter\" series. It can be wasteful\nto try to avoid all waste. Efficiency is also a trap\nwhen the opposition copies it. Take the late 19th-century French 75-millimeter artillery piece. It was a masterpiece of lethal design. This piece could fire a shell\nevery four seconds. But that wasn't so unusual. What was really brilliant\nwas that because of the recoil mechanism, it could return to the exact same position without having to be reaimed. So the effective rate of firing\nwas drastically increased. Now, this seemed to be a way for France to defeat Germany\nthe next time they fought. But, predictably, the Germans were working on something very similar. So when the First World War broke out, the result was the trench warfare that lasted longer\nthan anybody had expected. A technology that was designed\nto shorten the war, prolonged it. The biggest cost of all\nmay be missed opportunities. The platform economy\nconnecting buyers and sellers can be a great investment, and we have seen that\nin the last few weeks. Companies that are still losing\nhundreds of millions of dollars may be creating billionaires\nwith initial public offerings. But the really difficult inventions are the physical and chemical ones. They mean bigger risks. They may be losing out,\nbecause hardware is hard. It's much harder to scale up\na physical or chemical invention than it is a software-based invention. Think of batteries. Lithium-ion batteries\nin portable devices and electric cars are based on a 30-year-old principle. How many smartphone batteries today will last a full day on a single charge? Yes, hardware is hard. It took over 20 years for the patent on the principle of dry photocopying, by Chester Carlson in 1938, to result in the Xerox 914 copier\nintroduced in 1959. The small, brave company,\nHaloid in Rochester, NY had to go through what most corporations\nwould never have tolerated. There was one failure after another, and one of the special problems was fire. In fact, when the 914\nwas finally released, it still had a device\nthat was called a scorch eliminator but actually it was\na small fire extinguisher built in. My answer to all these questions is:\ninspired inefficiency. Data and measurement are essential,\nbut they're not enough. Let's leave room for human intuition\nand human skills. There are seven facets\nof inspired inefficiency. First, take the scenic route,\nsay yes to serendipity. Wrong turns can be productive. Once, when I was exploring\nthe east bank of the Mississippi, I took the wrong turn. I was approaching a toll bridge\ncrossing the great river, and the toll collector\nsaid I could not turn back. So I paid my 50 cents --\nthat's all it was at the time -- and I was in Muscatine, Iowa. I had barely heard of Muscatine, but it proved to be a fascinating place. Muscatine had some\nof the world's richest mussel beds. A century ago,\na third of the world's buttons were produced in Muscatine, 1.5 billion a year. The last plants have closed now, but there is still a museum\nof the pearl button industry that's one of the most\nunusual in the world. But buttons were only the beginning. This is the house in Muscatine where China's future\npresident stayed in 1986, as a member of an agricultural delegation. It is now the Sino-US Friendship House, and it's a pilgrimage site\nfor Chinese tourists. How could I have foreseen that? (Laughter) Second, get up from the couch. Sometimes it can be more efficient to do things the hard way. Consider the internet of things. It's wonderful\nto be able to control lights, set the thermostat, even vacuum the room without leaving one's seat. But medical research has shown that actually fidgeting,\ngetting up, walking around is one of the best things\nyou can do for your heart. It's good for the heart and the waistline. Third, monetize your mistakes. Great forms can be created by imaginative development of accidents. Tad Leski, an architect\nof the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center, was working on a sketch\nand some white ink fell on the drawing. Other people might just\nhave thrown it away, but Leski was inspired\nto produce a starburst chandelier that was probably the most notable\nof its kind of the 20th century. Fourth, sometimes try the hard way. It can be more efficient\nto be less fluent. Psychologists call this\ndesirable difficulty. Taking detailed notes with a keyboard would seem to be the best way\nto grasp what a lecturer is saying, to be able to review it verbatim. However, studies have shown\nthat when we have to abbreviate, when we have to summarize\nwhat a speaker is saying, when we're taking notes\nwith a pen or a pencil on paper, we're processing that information. We're making that our own, and we are learning much more actively than when we were just transcribing what was being said. Fifth, get security through diversity. Monoculture can be deadly. Remember the potato? It was efficient until it wasn't. Diversity applies to organizations, too. Software can tell what has made people\nin an organization succeed in the past. And it's useful, sometimes,\nin screening employees. But remember, the environment\nis constantly changing, and software, screening software,\nhas no way to tell, and we have no way to tell, who is going to be useful in the future. So, we need to supplement\nwhatever the algorithm tells us by an intuition and by looking for people with various backgrounds\nand various outlooks. Sixth, achieve safety\nthrough redundancy and human skills. Why did two 737 Max aircraft crash? We still don't know the full story, but we know how to\nprevent future tragedies. We need multiple independent systems. If one fails, then the others\ncan override it. We also need skilled operators\nto come to the rescue and that means constant training. Seventh, be rationally extravagant. Thomas Edison was a pioneer\nof the film industry, as well as of camera technology. Nobody has done more\nfor efficiency than Thomas Edison. But his cost cutting broke down. His manager hired\na so-called efficiency engineer, who advised him to save money by using more of the film stock\nthat he'd shot, having fewer retakes. Well, Edison was a genius, but he didn't understand\nthe new rules of feature films and the fact that failure\nwas becoming the price of success. On the other hand, some great directors,\nlike Erich Von Stroheim, were the opposite. They were superb dramatists, and Stroheim was also a memorable actor. But they couldn't live\nwithin their budgets. So that was not sustainable. It was Irving Thalberg,\na former secretary with intuitive genius, who achieved rational extravagance. First at Universal, and then at MGM, becoming the ideal\nof the Hollywood producer. Summing up, to be truly efficient, we need optimal inefficiency. The shortest path may be a curve rather than a straight line. Charles Darwin understood that. When he encountered a tough problem, he made a circuit of a trail, the sandwalk that he'd built\nbehind his house. A productive path\ncan be physical, like Darwin's, or a virtual one, or an unforeseen detour from a path we had laid out. Too much efficiency can weaken itself. But a bit of inspired inefficiency\ncan strengthen it. Sometimes, the best way to move forward is to follow a circle. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

It’s the only thing between \nthem and the tower that houses the second \nof three powerful artifacts. They’ve got a brief window of time \nto get across before the guards return. With Hedge’s fuel gauge on empty \nhe won’t be able to fly Ethic across, so the only option is to make a bridge. Fortunately, the floating stacks of stones\nnearby are bridge components— invented by Octavia herself— \ncalled hover-blocks. Activate a pile with a burst of energy, and they’ll self-assemble \nto span the ravine as Ethic walks across. But there is, of course, a catch. The hover-blocks are only stable \nwhen they’re perfectly palindromic. Meaning they have to form \na sequence that’s the same when viewed \nforwards and backwards. The stacks start in random orders, but will always put themselves\ninto a palindromic configuration if they can. If they get to a point \nwhere a palindrome isn’t possible, the bridge will collapse, and whoever’s on it \nwill fall into the ravine. Let’s look at an example. This stack would make itself stable. First the A blocks \nhold themselves in place. Then the B’s. And finally the C \nwould nestle right between the B’s. However, suppose there was one more A. First two A blocks form up, then two B’s, but now the remaining C and A \nhave nowhere to go, so the whole thing falls apart. The Node of Power enables Hedge \nto energize a single stack of blocks. What instructions can Ethic give Hedge \nto allow him to efficiently find and power a stable palindromic stack? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Examples of palindromes include ANNA, \nRACECAR, and MADAM IM ADAM. Counting the number of times \na given letter appears in a palindrome will reveal a helpful pattern. Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Let’s first look at a naïve solution \nto this problem. A naïve solution is a simple, \nbrute-force approach that isn’t optimized— but will get the job done. Naïve solutions are helpful ways \nto analyze problems, and work as stepping stones \nto better solutions. In this case, a naïve solution\nis to approach a pile of blocks, try all the arrangements, and see if one is a palindrome \nby reading it forward and then backwards. The problem with this approach is that it would take \na tremendous amount of time. If Hedge tried one combination \nevery second, a stack of just 10 different blocks \nwould take him 42 days to exhaust. That’s because the total time \nis a function of the factorial of the number of blocks there are. 10 blocks \nhave over 3 million combinations. What this naïve solution shows \nis that we need a much faster way to tell whether a pile of blocks \ncan form a palindrome. To start, it may be intuitively clear \nthat a pile of all different blocks will never form one. Why? The first and last blocks \ncan’t be the same if there are no repeats. So when can a given sequence \nbecome a palindrome? One way to figure that out \nis to analyze a few existing palindromes. In ANNA, \nthere are 2 A’s and 2 N’s. RACECAR \nhas 2 R’s, 2 A’s, 2 C’s, and 1 E. And MADAM IM ADAM \nhas 4 M’s, 4 A’s, 2 D’s, and 1 I. The pattern here \nis that most of the letters occur an even number of times, and there’s at most 1 \nthat occurs just once. Is that it? What if RACECAR had 3 E’s instead of 1? We could tack the new E’s onto the ends \nand still get a palindrome, so 3 is ok. But make that 3 E’s and 3 C’s, \nand there’s nowhere for the last C to go. So the most generalized insight is that at most one letter can appear \nan odd number of times, but the rest have to be even. Hedge can count the letters in each stack \nand organize them into a dictionary, which is a tidy way \nof storing information. A loop could then go through and count \nhow many times odd numbers appear. If there are less than 2 odd characters, \nthe stack can be made into a palindrome. This approach is much, much faster \nthan the naïve solution. Instead of factorial time, \nit takes linear time. That’s where the time increases in proportion to \nthe number of blocks there are. Now write a loop for Hedge \nto approach the piles individually, and stop when he finds a good one, \nand you’ll be ready to go. Here’s what happens: Hedge is fast, but there are so many piles\nit takes a long time. Too long. Ethic and Hedge are safe. But Octavia is not so lucky."}, "multiple-choice": []}

This wasp queen is one of thousands \nwho mated in late autumn and hibernated through the winter. Now she emerges into the spring air \nto begin her reign. Most of her sisters weren’t so lucky. While hibernating in compost piles \nand underground burrows, many sleeping queens \nwere eaten by spiders. Warm winters caused by climate change \nled other queens to emerge early, only to find there was no available food. And some queens that survived the winter \nfell victim to the threats of spring, such as carnivorous plants, birds, \nand manmade pesticides. Our queen is the lone survivor \nof her old hive, and now, she must become \nthe foundress of a new one. But first, breakfast. The queen heads for a citrus grove \nfull of honeybee hives. The bees can be dangerous if provoked, but right now they’re paralyzed \nby the morning cold. Their hairy bodies are dripping \nwith sugar water from an earlier feeding, and the resourceful queen \nlicks them for a morning snack. Newly energized, our queen searches \nfor a safe nesting area. This tree hollow, safe from rain, wind, \nand predators, is ideal. She chews the surrounding wood \nand plant fibers to make a paper-like pulp. Then she builds around 50 brood cells \nthat comprise the beginning of her nest. Using sperm stored from last fall, the queen lays a fertilized egg \ninto each cell, producing as many as 12 in 20 minutes. Within a week, \nthese will hatch into female larva. But until then, the queen must hunt down \nsmaller insects to feed her brood, all while expanding the hive, laying eggs,\nand defending against intruders. Fortunately, our queen is well prepared. Unlike bees, wasps can sting as many times\nas they need to. With such a busy schedule, \nthe queen barely has time to feed herself. Luckily, she doesn’t have to. When she feeds an insect to her grubs, they digest the bug into a sugary \nsubstance that sustains their mother. By the end of July, these first larva \nhave matured into adult workers, ready to take on foraging, \nbuilding, and defense. The queen can now lay eggs full-time, sustaining herself on her worker’s spoils \nand their unfertilized eggs. Although each worker only lives \nfor roughly 3 weeks, the queen’s continuous egg-laying \nswells their ranks. In just one summer, \nthe nest reaches the size of a basketball, supporting thousands of workers. Such a large population needs to eat, and the nearby garden \nprovides a veritable buffet. As the swarm descends, \nalarmed humans try to swat them. They even fight back with pesticides \nthat purposefully poison wasps, and inadvertently impact \na wide-range of local wildlife. But the wasps are actually vital \nto this ecosystem. Sitting at the top \nof the local invertebrate food chain, these insects keep spiders, mites, \nand centipedes, in check. Wasps consume crop-eating insects, making them particularly helpful \nfor farms and gardens. They even pollinate fruits and vegetables, and help winemakers \nby biting into their grapes and jump-starting fermentation. This feast continues until autumn, \nwhen the foundress changes course. She begins grooming some eggs \ninto a new generation of queens, while also laying unfertilized eggs that will mature into reproductive males \ncalled drones. This new crop of queens and males \nrequires more food. But with summer over, \nthe usual sources run dry, and the foraging wasps \nstart taking more aggressive risks. By September, \nthe hive’s organization deteriorates. Hungry workers no longer clean the nest \nand various scavengers move in. Just when it seems \nthe hive can no longer sustain itself, the fertile queens and their drones \ndepart in a massive swarm. As the days grow colder, \nthe workers starve, and our queen \nreaches the end of her lifespan. But above, a swarm of reproductive wasps \nhas successfully mated. The males die off shortly after, but the newly fertilized queens are ready \nto find shelter for their long sleep.

Each of these cells \nhas its origins deep in your bones. Bones might seem rock-solid, \nbut they’re actually quite porous inside. Large and small blood vessels \nenter through these holes. And inside most of the large bones \nof your skeleton is a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow. Marrow contains fat \nand other supportive tissue, but its most essential elements \nare blood stem cells. These stem cells are constantly dividing. They can differentiate \ninto red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, and send about hundreds of billions \nof new blood cells into circulation every day. These new cells enter the bloodstream through holes \nin small capillaries in the marrow. Through the capillaries, they reach larger blood vessels \nand exit the bone. If there’s a problem with your blood, there’s a good chance \nit can be traced back to the bone marrow. Blood cancers often begin \nwith genetic mutations in the stem cells. The stem cells themselves \nare not cancerous, but these mutations can interfere \nwith the process of differentiation and result in malignant blood cells. So for patients with advanced \nblood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, the best chance for a cure is often \nan allogeneic bone marrow transplant, which replaces the patient’s bone marrow \nwith a donor’s. Here’s how it works. First, blood stem cells \nare extracted from the donor. Most commonly, blood stem cells are filtered out \nof the donor’s bloodstream by circulating the blood \nthrough a machine that separates it \ninto different components. In other cases, \nthe marrow is extracted directly from a bone in the hip, the iliac crest, \nwith a needle. Meanwhile, the recipient \nprepares for the transplant. High doses of chemotherapy or radiation \nkill the patient’s existing marrow, destroying both malignant cells \nand blood stem cells. This also weakens the immune system, making it less likely \nto attack the transplanted cells. Then the donor cells are infused into \nthe patient’s body through a central line. They initially circulate \nin the recipient’s peripheral bloodstream, but molecules on the stem cells, \ncalled chemokines, act as homing devices and quickly traffic them \nback to the marrow. Over the course of a few weeks, they begin to multiply and start producing\nnew, healthy blood cells. Just a small population \nof blood stem cells can regenerate a whole body’s \nworth of healthy marrow. A bone marrow transplant \ncan also lead to something called graft-versus-tumor activity, when new immune cells \ngenerated by the donated marrow can wipe out cancer cells the recipient’s \noriginal immune system couldn’t. This phenomenon can help eradicate \nstubborn blood cancers. But bone marrow transplants \nalso come with risks, including graft-versus-host disease. It happens when the immune system \ngenerated by the donor cells attacks the patient’s organs. This life-threatening condition \noccurs in about 30–50% of patients who receive donor cells \nfrom anyone other than an identical twin, particularly when the stem cells \nare collected from the blood \nas opposed to the bone marrow. Patients may take \nimmunosuppressant medications or certain immune cells may be removed \nfrom the donated sample in order to reduce the risk \nof graft-versus-host disease. But even if a patient \navoids graft-versus-host disease, their immune system \nmay reject the donor cells. So it’s crucial to find the best match \npossible in the first place. Key regions of the genetic code \ndetermine how the immune system identifies foreign cells. If these regions are similar \nin the donor and the recipient, the recipient’s immune system \nis more likely to accept the donor cells. Because these genes are inherited, \nthe best matches are often siblings. But many patients \nwho need a bone marrow transplant don’t have a matched family member. Those patients \nturn to donor registries of volunteers willing to offer their bone marrow. All it takes to be on the registry is \na cheek swab to test for a genetic match. And in many cases, \nthe donation itself isn’t much more complicated \nthan giving blood. It’s a way to save someone’s life with a resource \nthat’s completely renewable."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are the potential sources of bone marrow donation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Peripheral blood"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bone marrow"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cord blood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of these diseases is not a blood cancer?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Leukemia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lymphoma"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Colon cancer"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which one of these cells is not produced in the bone marrow?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Red blood cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "White blood cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Platelets"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cardiac cells"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

It had to be done. (Applause) But lately, I've been thinking\nwe need to do something even harder. We need, as my good friend\nTony Porter says, to find a way to call men in. My father began to sexually abuse me\nwhen I was five years old. He would come into my room\nin the middle of the night. He appeared to be in a trance. The abuse continued until I was 10. When I tried to resist him, when I was finally able to say no, he began to beat me. He called me stupid. He said I was a liar. The sexual abuse ended when I was 10, but actually, it never ended. It changed who I was. I was filled with anxiety and guilt\nand shame all the time, and I didn't know why. I hated my body, I hated myself, I got sick a lot, I couldn't think, I couldn't remember things. I was drawn to dangerous men and women who I allowed -- actually, I invited --\nto treat me badly, because that is what my father\ntaught me love was. I waited my whole life\nfor my father to apologize to me. He didn't. He wouldn't. And then, with the recent\nscandals of famous men, as one after another was exposed, I realized something: I have never heard a man who has committed rape\nor physical violence ever publicly apologize to his victim. I began to wonder, what would an authentic,\ndeep apology be like? So, something strange began to happen. I began to write, and my father's voice\nbegan to come through me. He began to tell me what he had done and why. He began to apologize. My father is dead almost 31 years, and yet, in this apology, the one I had to write for him, I discovered the power of an apology and how it actually might be\nthe way to move forward in the crisis we now face with men and all the women they abuse. Apology is a sacred commitment. It requires complete honesty. It demands deep\nself-interrogation and time. It cannot be rushed. I discovered an apology has four steps, and, if you would,\nI'd like to take you through them. The first is you have to say\nwhat, in detail, you did. Your accounting cannot be vague. \"I'm sorry if I hurt you\" or \"I'm sorry if I sexually abused you\" doesn't cut it. You have to say what actually happened. \"I came into the room\nin the middle of the night, and I pulled your underpants down.\" \"I belittled you because\nI was jealous of you and I wanted you to feel less.\" The liberation is in the details. An apology is a remembering. It connects the past with the present. It says that what occurred\nactually did occur. The second step\nis you have to ask yourself why. Survivors are haunted by the why. Why? Why would my father want\nto sexually abuse his eldest daughter? Why would he take my head\nand smash it against a wall? In my father's case, he was a child born long after\nthe other children. He was an accident\nthat became \"the miracle.\" He was adored and treated\nas the golden boy. But adoration, it turns out, is not love. Adoration is a projection of someone's need for you to be perfect onto you. My father had to live up\nto this impossible ideal, and so he was never allowed to be himself. He was never allowed to express tenderness or vulnerability, curiosity, doubt. He was never allowed to cry. And so he was forced to push\nall those feelings underground, and they eventually metastasized. Those suppressed feelings\nlater became Shadowman, and he was out of control, and he eventually unleashed\nhis torrent on me. The third step is you have\nto open your heart and feel what your victim felt\nas you were abusing her. You have to let your heart break. You have to feel the horror and betrayal and the long-term impacts\nof your abuse on your victim. You have to sit with the suffering\nyou have caused. And, of course, the fourth step is taking responsibility\nfor what you have done and making amends. So, why would anyone want to go through\nsuch a grueling and humbling process? Why would you want to rip yourself open? Because it is the only thing\nthat will set yourself free. It is the only thing\nthat will set your victim free. You didn't just destroy your victim. You destroyed yourself. There is no one who enacts\nviolence on another person who doesn't suffer\nfrom the effects themselves. It creates an incredibly dark\nand contaminating spirit, and it spreads\nthroughout your entire life. The apology I wrote -- I learned something about a different lens\nwe have to look through to understand the problem\nof men's violence that I and one billion\nother women have survived. We often turn to punishment first. It's our first instinct, but actually, although punishment\nsometimes is effective, on its own, it is not enough. My father punished me. I was shut down, and I was broken. I think punishment hardens us,\nbut it doesn't teach us. Humiliation is not revelation. We actually need to create a process\nthat may involve punishment, whereby we open a doorway where men can actually become\nsomething and someone else. For so many years, I hated my father. I wanted him dead. I wanted him in prison. But actually, that rage kept me\nconnected to my father's story. What I really wanted\nwasn't just for my father to be stopped. I wanted him to change. I wanted him to apologize. That's what we want. We don't want men to be destroyed, we don't want them to only be punished. We want them to see us,\nthe victims that they have harmed, and we want them to repent and change. And I actually believe this is possible. And I really believe it's our way forward. But we need men to join us. We need men now to be brave\nand be part of this transformation. I have spent most of my life\ncalling men out, and I am here now, right now, to call you in. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you, thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

As the Roman Empire \nflourished further south, Scandinavians had small settlements, \nno central government, and no coinage. Yet by the 11th century, the Vikings \nhad spread far from Scandinavia, gaining control of trade routes \nthroughout Europe, conquering kingdoms as far as Africa, and even building outposts \nin North America. The secret to their success \nwas their ships. The formidable Viking longship had its origins \nin the humble dugout canoe, or log boat. For millennia, the inhabitants of Scandinavia \nhad used these canoes for transportation. Dense forests and tall mountains \nmade overland travel difficult, but long coastlines \nand numerous rivers, lakes, and fjords provided a viable alternative. The first canoes were simply hollowed out \nlogs rowed with paddles. Over time, they added planks \nto the log boat base using the clinker, \nor \"lapstrake,\" technique, meaning the planks overlapped and were fastened to each other \nalong their edges. As the Roman Empire expanded north, some Scandinavians \nserved in their new neighbors’ armies— and brought home \nRoman maritime technology. The Mediterranean cultures \nat the heart of the Roman Empire had large warships \nthat controlled the sea, and cargo ships that transported goods \nalong the waterways. These ships were powered by sail and oars and relied on a strong skeleton \nof internal timbers fastened to the outer planks \nwith copper, iron, and wood nails. At first, Scandinavians \nincorporated this new technology by replacing their loose paddles \nwith anchored oars. This change \nhugely improved the crew’s efficiency, but also required stronger ships. So boat builders began to use iron nails \nfor fasteners rather than sewing. They abandoned \nthe log boat base for a keel plank, and the boats became higher \nand more seaworthy. But these early ships retained the concept\nof the original log boat: their strength \ndepended on the outer shell of wood, not internal frames and beams. They were built as shells— \nthin-walled but strong, and much lighter than the Roman ships. Competing chieftains quickly refined \nthe new ships to be even more efficient. The lighter the boat, \nthe more versatile it would be and the less investment of resources \nit would require— an essential advantage \nin a decentralized culture without large supplies of people. These ships still had no sails— \nsails were costly, and for now the rowed ships \ncould meet their needs. That changed \nafter the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century. Western Europe \ntook a heavy economic blow, leveling the playing field a bit \nfor the Scandinavians. As the region revived, new and vigorous trade routes \nextended into and through Scandinavia. The wealth that flowed along these routes helped create a new, more prosperous \nand powerful class of Scandinavians, whose members \ncompeted constantly with each other over trade routes and territory. By the 8th century, \na sailing ship began to make sense: it could go further, faster, \nin search of newly available plunder. With the addition of sails, the already light and speedy ships \nbecame nearly unbeatable. The Viking ship was born. Viking longships could soon carry \nas many as 100 Vikings to battle. Fleets of them \ncould land on open beaches, penetrate deep into river systems, \nand be moved over land if need be. When not at war, the vessels were used to transport goods \nand make trade journeys. There were smaller versions \nfor fishing and local excursions, and larger adaptations \nfor open sea voyages capable of carrying \ntens of tons of cargo.

At first glance,\nthis might be a disturbing sight. But for the lucky males and females \nof Solenopsis invicta, otherwise known as fire ants, \nit’s a day of romance. This is the nuptial flight, when thousands of reproduction-capable \nmale and female ants, called alates, \ntake wing for the first and last time. But even for successful males \nwho manage to avoid winged predators, this mating frenzy will prove lethal. And for a successfully mated female, \nher work is only beginning. Having secured a lifetime supply of sperm \nfrom her departed mate, our new queen must now single-handedly \nstart an entire colony. Descending to the ground, she searches for a suitable spot \nto build her nest. Ideally, she can find somewhere \nwith loose, easy-to-dig soil— like farmland \nalready disturbed by human activity. Once she finds the perfect spot, \nshe breaks off her wings— creating the stubs \nthat establish her royal status. Then, she starts digging \na descending tunnel ending in a chamber. Here the queen begins laying her eggs, \nabout ten per day, and the first larvae hatch within a week. Over the next three weeks, the new queen relies on a separate batch \nof unfertilized eggs to nourish both herself and her brood, losing half her body weight \nin the process. Thankfully, after about 20 days, these larvae grow \ninto the first generation of workers, ready to forage for food \nand sustain their shrunken queen. Her daughters \nwill have to work quickly though— returning their mother \nto good health is urgent. In the surrounding area, dozens of neighboring queens \nare building their own ant armies. These colonies \nhave peacefully coexisted so far, but once workers appear, a phenomenon known as brood-raiding \nbegins. Workers from nests \nup to several meters away begin to steal offspring \nfrom our queen. Our colony retaliates, but new waves of raiders \nfrom even further away overwhelm the workers. Within hours, the raiders have taken \nour queen’s entire brood supply to the largest nearby nest— and the queen’s surviving daughters \nabandon her. Chasing her last chance of survival, the queen follows the raiding trail \nto the winning nest. She fends off other losing queens \nand the defending nest’s workers, fighting her way \nto the top of the brood pile. Her daughters help their mother succeed \nwhere other queens fail— defeating the reigning monarch, \nand usurping the brood pile. Eventually, \nall the remaining challengers fail, until only one queen— \nand one brood pile— remains. Now presiding over several hundred workers\nin the neighborhood’s largest nest, our victorious queen begins \naiding her colony in its primary goal: reproduction. For the next several years, \nthe colony only produces sterile workers. But once their population \nexceeds about 23,000, it changes course. From now on, every spring, the colony will produce \nfertile alate males and females. The colony spawns these larger ants \nthroughout the early summer, and returns to worker production \nin the fall. After heavy rainfalls, \nthese alates take to the skies, and spread their queen’s genes \nup to a couple hundred meters downwind. But to contribute \nto this annual mating frenzy, the colony must continue to thrive \nas one massive super-organism. Every day, younger ants feed the queen \nand tend to the brood, while older workers \nforage for food and defend the nest. When intruders strike, these older warriors fend them off \nusing poisonous venom. After rainfalls, \nthe colony comes together, using the wet dirt to expand their nest. And when a disastrous flood \ndrowns their home, the sisters band together \ninto a massive living raft— carrying their queen to safety. But no matter how resilient, the life of a colony must come to an end. After about 8 years, \nour queen runs out of sperm and can no longer replace dying workers.

{"page": 16, "lesson": 20, "title": "The ballet that incited a riot - Iseult Gillespie", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-ballet-that-incited-a-riot-iseult-gillespie", "transcript": {"en": "We typically think of ballet \nas harmonious, graceful and polished– hardly features that would trigger a riot. But at the first performance \nof Igor Stravinsky’s \"The Rite of Spring,\" audience members were so outraged \nthat they drowned out the orchestra. Accounts of the event include \npeople hurling objects at the stage, challenging each other to fights, \nand getting arrested– all on what started \nas a sophisticated night at the ballet. First performed in May 1913 at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées \nin Paris, \"The Rite of Spring\" \nis set in prehistoric times. The narrative follows \nan ancient Pagan community worshipping the Earth \nand preparing for the sacrifice of a woman intended to bring about \nthe change of seasons. But the ballet is much more \nconcerned with the violent relationship between humans, nature, and culture than with character or plot. These themes manifest \nin a truly upsetting production which combines harsh music, \njerky dancing, and uncanny staging. It opens with dancers \nawakening to a solo bassoon, playing in an eerily high register. This gives way to discordant strings, \npunctured by unexpected pauses while the dancers twitch to the music. These frightening figures \nenact the ballet’s brutal premise, which set audiences on edge and shattered the conventions \nof classical music. In these ways and many more, \"The Rite of Spring\" \nchallenged the orchestral traditions of the 19th century. Composed on the cusp \nof both the first World War and the Russian revolution, \"The Rite of Spring\" seethes with urgency. This tension is reflected \nin various formal experiments, including innovative uses of syncopation, \nor irregular rhythm; atonality or the lack of a single key, and the presence \nof multiple time signatures. Alongside these \nstrikingly modern features, Stravinsky spliced in aspects \nof Russian folk music– a combination that deliberately disrupted the expectations of his sophisticated, \nurban audience. This wasn’t Stravinsky’s \nfirst use of folk music. Born in a small town \noutside of St. Petersburg in 1882, Stravinsky’s reputation was cemented \nwith the lush ballet \"The Firebird.\" Based on a Russian fairytale, this production \nwas steeped in Stravinsky’s fascination with folk culture. But he plotted a wilder project \nin \"The Rite of Spring,\" pushing folk and musical boundaries \nto draw out the rawness of pagan ritual. Stravinsky brought this reverie to life in collaboration \nwith artist Nicholas Roerich. Roerich was obsessed \nwith prehistoric times. He had published essays \nabout human sacrifice and worked on excavations \nof Slavic tombs in addition to set and costume design. For \"The Rite of Spring,\" \nhe drew from Russian medieval art and peasant garments to create costumes \nthat hung awkwardly on the dancers’ bodies. Roerich set them against vivid backdrops \nof primeval nature; full of jagged rocks, looming trees \nand nightmarish colors. Along with its dazzling sets \nand searing score, the original choreography \nfor \"The Rite of Spring\" was highly provocative. This was the doing \nof legendary dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, who developed dances \nto rethink “the roots of movement itself.” Although Stravinsky \nlater expressed frustration with Nijinsky’s demanding rehearsals and single-minded interpretations \nof the music, his choreography proved \nas pioneering as Stravinsky’s composition. He contorted traditional ballet– to both the awe and horror \nof his audience, many of whom expected \nthe refinement and romance of the genre. The dancing in \"The Rite of Spring\" \nis agitated and uneven, with performers cowering, writhing \nand leaping about as if possessed. Often, the dancers are not one \nwith the music but rather seem to struggle against it. Nijinsky instructed them \nto turn their toes inwards and land heavily after jumps,\noften off the beat. For the final, frenzied scene, a woman dances herself to death \nto loud bangs and jarring strings. The ballet ends abruptly on a harsh, \nhaunting chord. Today, \"The Rite of Spring\" remains as chilling \nas its controversial debut, but the shockwaves of the original work\ncontinue to resound and inspire. You can hear Stravinsky’s influence \nin modern jazz’s dueling rhythms, folky classical music, \nand even film scores for horror movies, which still illicit \na riotous audience response."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Is the Rite of Spring is more concerned with telling a story or stylistic innovation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Telling a story"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stylistic innovation"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who wrote \"The Rite of Spring?\"", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Igor Stravinsky"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Antonio Vivaldi"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Louis Spohr"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Where was \"The Rite of Spring\" set?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ancient Greece"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Russia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Egypt"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Prehistoric times"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which are features of the first production?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Clashing chords and syncopation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Melodic harmonies and syncopation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Steady rhythms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Melodic harmonies and clashing chords"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "For the sets of the first production, what was Nicholas Roerich inspired by?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Russian art"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Folk clothing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prehistoric times"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ancient burial practices"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of these things"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What does the final scene depict?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A marriage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A woman dancing herself to death"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A battle"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

The adventurers \nhave recovered the first artifact— the Node of Power— and have come to the 198forest \nin search of the second. Here they’re welcomed \nby the director of the colony, Octavia. She established this treehouse sanctuary after the robots freed everyone \nfrom having to work. It was meant to be a haven \nwhere people could follow their passions, take up crafts, and find fulfillment. Which they did… at first. Some years ago everyone forgot the point. They abandoned arts and crafts and instead just painted and exhibited \npictures of themselves over, and over, and over. The location of the second artifact \nis no secret; it’s in a tower, \nguarded by a garrison of bots, a bottomless ravine, \nand who knows what other traps. As soon as the tower \nwent up with the node inside, human communication \nacross the land went dark. Octavia’s been after it for years, but try as she might, \nthe defenses thwart her. In order to even get to the tower, \nthe team will need a distraction. Octavia has an idea: stir up the people \nthrough some well-intentioned vandalism. The residents’ paintings are all squares \nthat come in different sizes, all an odd number of pixels across. Helper-bots \npick up the finished portraits and hang them in public places \nfor everyone to admire. There’s a slim margin of time \nwhen Hedge can access the paintings. If he were to deface each one with an X, the people would blame the helper-bots, creating just the distraction \nthe team needs. If only it were so easy. Hedge can’t just paint an X— his painting processor \nrequires very specific instructions. Treating the paintings as square grids, he can fill in one pixel, \nor little square, at a time. He can move forwards \nand make 90 degree turns over the canvas, but can’t move diagonally. How does Ethic program Hedge \nto paint an X over each portrait? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Here’s a hint. Try drawing a square grid like this, and simulating Hedge’s path over it. What patterns can you find to guide him? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. The challenge here \nis to craft a set of instructions that will work for any square grid. Fortunately, \none of the strengths of programming is the flexibility \nto solve not just one problem, but a whole class of them all at once. It often helps to start with one case, \nand work towards the general. Let’s say we had this square. Hedge can measure the length of its sides \nand store that number as a variable. Now, what we need is a plan \nfor how Hedge will paint an X, pixel by pixel. There’s more than one right answer \nfor how to do this; let’s look at two. First, what if Hedge went row by row, \nlike a typewriter? If it’s a 9 pixel by 9 pixel painting, in the first row he’d paint, \nskip 7, and then paint again. In the second row he’d skip the first, \npaint, skip 5, and paint. And so on. The pattern here is that for each row \nthe pixels skipped at the beginning go up by one, and the pixels skipped in the middle \ngo down by 2. Things get more complicated \nwhen Hedge reaches the center. Here there’s a row \nwith just one pixel painted. Then the whole thing reverses— the number of pixels skipped \ngoes down by one each time on the left, and up by two each time in the middle. Instructing Hedge to do this \nwith a series of loops will work and is a perfectly fine solution. The main drawback is that \nthis requires quite a bit of logic— knowing what to do in the middle, \nwhen to reverse the process, and exactly how to reverse it. So how might we approach this so that the logic remains consistent \nfrom start to finish? The key insight is to look at a grid \nas a series of concentric squares. Each square follows the same pattern— painted pixels in the corners, \nand unaltered pixels in between. So if we can figure out a way \nto paint one nested square, transition to the next, and repeat, \nwe can paint them all. Painting the outermost one is easy. Start in a corner and paint that pixel. If we call the length of the painting n, fly forward n minus 1 spaces. Paint another pixel, and turn right. Now do the whole thing again… and again. Now move forward one less space, \nturn right, fly forward once, and Hedge will be \nin the next concentric square and ready to repeat the whole process. Each square is n minus 2 pixels smaller \nthan the last in length and width, and we can follow this spiral pattern \nall the way to the center with a loop and a variable \nthat tracks how far Hedge should fly. Is one of these methods \nbetter than the other? It really depends on what you value. The strength of the spiral \nis the simplicity of finding a pattern and reusing the same logic \nfrom start to finish. The advantage of the typewriter approach is that it’s a more generalized solution, meaning it can be adapted \nmuch more simply to fill in any pattern. For Ethic’s sake, \neither will do just fine. So here’s what happens. Hedge rapidly defaces \nall of the portraits. And within moments cries of anguish \nbreak out all over the forest. The garrison guarding the tower \nabandon their posts to calm the agitated people, and Ethic, Hedge, \nand Octavia slip through— and nearly slip \ninto the depths of the gorge standing between them and the tower."}, "multiple-choice": []}

Every five years, teams representing \nthe elves, goblins, and treefolk will compete in a grand tournament \nof dragon jousting. Every team will face \neach of the others once. The kingdom whose team wins the most \nmatches will rule all of Center-Realm until the next tournament. To prevent any outside meddling, the games are to be conducted \nin absolute secret except for a group of wizards \nwho will make sure nobody uses enchantments, hexes, \nor spells to cheat. You’ve been given the extremely \nimportant job of recording the scores for the first inaugural tournament. But the opening celebrations \nget a bit out of control, and when you wake up, you realize the games \nare already underway. Fortunately, no one has noticed \nyour absence so far. However, you need to get up to speed \nquickly; if your boss, \nthe head tournament official, finds out you’ve been sleeping on the job,\nyou’ll lose your head. After weighing your options, you decide to offer your life’s savings \nto one of the regulation wizards in return for the information, giving him your blank scorecard \nto fill out. But before he can finish, \nyour boss walks into the tent. You barely manage to hide the scorecard \nin time, and the wizard excuses himself. Your boss chuckles. “Hope you didn’t believe anything \nGorbak’s been saying— he’s been cursed to tell only lies, \neven in writing. Anyway, can you believe how low-scoring \nthe tournament’s been? Every team has played at least once, yet not a single match with \na combined score of more than five hits! Anyhow, I’ll be back in a minute \nto review your scorecard.” You laugh along, and when he leaves you look \nat the partially completed card, now knowing every single number \non it is wrong. You’ve only got one chance \nto save yourself, so what’s the real score of each match? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. The incredible thing about this riddle \nis that you can reach the solution despite an almost complete lack \nof correct information. And that’s possible because \nknowing that something is false is meaningful information \nin its own right. The first key is to realize that no team \nwill play more than two matches, since there are only two other teams. So if the elves didn’t actually play \none match, and the goblins didn’t actually play two, the truth must be that elves played two \nand goblins played one. For the elves to have played two matches, they must’ve faced each of the other teams\nonce. And since goblins have only played \none match so far— against the elves— that means the match between goblins \nand treefolk has not occurred yet. We know it’s false that the treefolk tied \nzero matches, which means their bout \nagainst the elves must’ve tied. We also know that the elves won \nat least one match, and since they tied against the treefolk, \nthey must have beaten the goblins. But can we figure out the actual scores? Let’s start with the elf-treefolk tie. Because no more than five total hits \nwere scored, the final tally must’ve been \n0-0, 1-1, or 2-2. But the treefolk must’ve scored \nsome hits, and it’s false that they only had one hit \nscored against them. The only option that leaves is 2-2. In the match between elves and goblins, the goblins must’ve scored \nat least one hit. And the elf score must be 2 or more \nfor them to have won the match. This leaves only a few possibilities \nthat add up to 5 or less. The elves couldn’t have scored three, \nso that eliminates these two. And their total hits scored \nacross both matches can’t add up to six, so this one’s out too. So the score must’ve been 2-1. With one match remaining, you’ve managed to save your job— \nand your neck. Gorbak the wizard may have lied, but your deductive skills \nquickly evened the score."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who is likely to be the ultimate winner of the tournament?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Elves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Goblins"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Treefolk"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which match has not occurred yet?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Goblins vs Treefolk"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Goblins vs Elves"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Treefolk vs Elves"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why are Gorbak’s numbers wrong?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He is trying to sabotage you"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He doesn’t actually know the score"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He’s under a curse where he consistently must lie"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why did you miss the early matches?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A wizard wiped your memory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Too much celebrating the night before"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The tournament was disrupted"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the matches ended in a tie?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Elves vs Treefolk"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Goblins vs Elves"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
