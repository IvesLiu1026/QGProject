{"page": 74, "lesson": 2, "title": "In praise of slowness - Carl Honore", "category": "Attention and Engagement", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/carl-honore-praises-slowness", "transcript": {"en": "what I'd like to start off with is an observation which is that if I've learned anything over the last year it's that the the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast I seem to spend most of my time these days you know zipping from city to city Studio to studio interview to interview serving up the book and Rudy tiny bite-size chunks because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down but but they want to know how to slow down really quickly so so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air and I think that that that's not really surprising though is it because that's kind of the world that we we live in now a world stuck in fast-forward a world obsessed with speed with doing everything faster with cramming more and more into less and less time every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock to borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher which is in my bio there I'll just toss it out again these days even instant gratification takes too long and if you think about how we try to make things better what do we do well we speed them up don't worry so you know we used to dial and now we speed dial we used to read now we speed read we used to walk now we speed walk and of course we used to date and now we speed date and even things that are by their very nature slow we try and speed them up too so I was in New York recently and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course a new evening course and it was for you guessed it speed yoga so this is the perfect solution for time-starved professionals who want to you know salute the Sun but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it these are sort of the extreme examples in there and they're amusing and go to laugh at but there's a very serious point and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life we we often lose sight of the damage that this Roadrunner form of living does to us we're so marinated in the culture of speed that we we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives on our health our diet our work our relationships in the environment and our community and sometimes it takes a wake-up call doesn't it to to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lie instead of actually living them that we're living the fast life instead of the good life and I think for many people that wake-up call takes the form of an illness you know a burnout or eventually the body says I can't take it anymore and throws in the towel or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we have another time or the patience or the tranquility to be with the other person to listen to them my wake-up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son and I found that at the end of the day I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down you know I'd be speed reading The Cat in the Hat I'd be you know I be skipping lines here paragraphs there sometimes a whole page and of course my little boy knew the book inside out so we would quarrel and what should have been the most relaxing the most intimate the most tender moment of the day when a dad sits down to read to his son became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills a clash between his speed and my speed and his slowness and this went on for some time until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with time-saving tips for fast people and one of them made reference to a series of books called the one-minute bedtime story and I I can by wynt saying those words now but my first reaction the time was very different my first reflex was to say hallelujah yeah what a great idea this is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more but thankfully a light bulb went on over my head and my next reaction was very different and I I took a step back and I thought whoa you know has it really come to this am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound bite at the end of the day and I put away the newspaper and I was getting on a plane and I sat there and I did something I hadn't done for a long time which was I did nothing I just fought I fought long and hard and by the time I got off that plane I decided I wanted to do something about it I wanted to investigate this whole Roadrunner culture and what it was doing to me and to everyone else and I had two questions in my head the first was how did we get so fast and the second is is it possible or even desirable to slow down now if you think about how our world got so accelerated the usual suspects rear their heads you think of you know urbanization consumerism the workplace technology but I think if you cut those forces you get to what might be the deeper driver the the nub of the question which is how we think about time itself in other cultures time is cyclical it's seen as moving in great unhurried circles it's always renewing and refreshing itself whereas in the West time is linear it's a finite resource it's always draining away you either use it or lose it time is money as Benjamin Franklin said and I think what that that does to us psychologically is it it creates an equation time is scarce so what do we do well well we speed up don't we we try and do more and more with less and less time we turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line a finish line incidentally that we never reach but a finish line nonetheless and I guess that the question is is it possible to break free from that mindset and thankfully the answer is yes because what I discovered when I began looking around that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better and that busier is best right across the world people are doing the unthinkable they're slowing down and finding that although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down you're roadkill the opposite turns out to be true that by slowing down at the right moments people find that they do everything better they eat better they make love better they exercise better they work better if they live better and in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration lie what a lot of people now refer to as the International slow movement now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy I'll just give you a very quick overview of what some this what's going on inside the slow movement if you think of food many of you will have heard of the slow food movement started in Italy but has spread across the world and now has a hundred thousand members in 50 countries and it's driven by a very simple and sensible message which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate cook and consume it at a reasonable pace I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement and the Renaissance of farmers market is another or other illustration of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable they want to get back to slower rhythms and out of the slow food movement has grown something called the slow cities movement which has started in Italy but has spread right across Europe and Beyond and in this towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape so that people are encouraged to to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another so they might curb traffic or put in a park bench or some green space and in some ways these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts because I think when a slow city becomes officially a slow city it's kind of like a philosophical declaration it's saying to the rest of the world and to the people in that town that we believe that in the 21st century slowness has a role to play in medicine I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine and millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine which tend to tap into sort of slower gentler more holistic forms of healing now obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever you know gain mainstream approval but other treatments such as acupuncture and massage and even just relaxation clearly have some kind of benefit and blue-chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work and what we might learn from them sex there's an awful lot of fast sex around isn't there I was coming to Ottawa nope no pun intended then I was making my way let's say slowly to Oxford and I went through a newsagent and I saw a magazine a men's magazine and it's set on the front how to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds so you know even sex is on a stopwatch these days now I you know I I like a quickie as much as the next person but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex from slowing down in the bedroom you know you tap into that those deeper sort of you know psychological emotional spiritual currents and you got a better orgasm with build up you to get more bang for your buck let's say I mean the pointer sisters said it most eloquently didn't they when they sang the praises of a lover with a slow hand now we all laughed at sting a few years ago when he went tantric but you fast forward a few years and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex and of course in Italy where I mean Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure they've launched an official slow sex movement the workplace right across much of the world I mean North America being a notable exception working hours have been coming down and Europe is an example of that and people people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less and also that their hourly productivity goes up now clearly there are problems with the 35 hour work week in France too much too soon too rigid but other countries in Europe notably the Nordic countries are showing that it's possible to have a kick-ass economy without being a workaholic and Norway Sweden Denmark and Finland now ranked among the top six most competitive nations on earth and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy and if you go beyond sort of the the country level down at the the micro company level more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug to take a lunch break or to go sit in a quiet room to switch off their BlackBerry's and laptops you at the back mobile phones during the workday or on the weekend so that they have time to recharge and to for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought it's not just though these days adults who were overworked though is it as children - I'm 37 and my childhood ended in the mid 80s and I look at kids now and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework more tutoring more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago and some of the most heart-rending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout pleading with me to write to their parents to help them slow down to help them get off this full-throttle treadmill but thankfully there is a backlash there in parenting as well and you're finding that you know towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month so that people can decompress and have some family time and slow down homework is another thing there are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years and now they're discovering that less can be more so there was a case up in Scotland recent they were a fee paying high achieving private school band homework for everyone under the age of 13 and the high achieving parents freaked out and said what do you know our kids our fault the headmaster said no no your children need to slow down at the end of the day and just this last month the exam results came in and in math science marks went up 20% on average last year and I think what's very revealing is that the elite universities who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling these kids have wonderful marks they have Seavey's jammed with extracurriculars to the point that would make your eyes water but they lack spark they lack the ability to think creatively and outside the blade they don't know how to dream and so what these Ivy League schools and Oxford and Cambridge and so on are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit and in Harvard for instance they send out a letter to undergraduates front freshmen telling them that they'll get more out of life and more out of Harvard if they if they put on the brakes if they'd if they do less but give time to things the time that things need to enjoy them to savor them and even if they sometimes do nothing at all and that letter is called very revealing I think slow down with an exclamation mark on the end so wherever you look the the message it seems to me is the same that less is very often more that slower is very often better but that's said of course it's it's not that easy to slow down is it I mean you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness and that's true but that's that's not all of it I was actually all route to a dinner held by slow food at the time and and if that's not shaming enough I got that ticket in Italy and if any of you have ever driven on an Italian Highway you have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going but why is it so hard to slow down I think there are various reasons one is that the speed is fun you know speed is sexy at all that adrenaline rush it's it's hard to give it up I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension that speed becomes a way of rolling ourselves off from the bigger deeper questions we fill our heads with distraction with busyness so that we don't have to ask am i well am i happy are my children growing up right are politicians making good decisions on my behalf another reason I think perhaps even the most powerful reason why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down the slow is a dirty word in our culture it's a byword for lazy slacker for being somebody who gives up you know he's a bit slow it's actually synonymous with being with being stupid I guess what the the slow move for the purpose of the slow movement or where this main goal really is to tackle that to boo and to say that but yes sometimes slow is not the the answer that there is such a thing as bad slow you know that I mean I got stuck on the m25 which is the Ring Road round London recently and spent three and a half hours there and I can tell you that's really bad slow but the new idea the sort of revolutionary idea of the slow movement is that there is such a thing as good slow too and good slow is you know taking the time to eat a meal with your family with the TV switched off or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life now one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out is is the reaction to it and I knew that when when my book on slowness came out it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade but it's also been taken up with great gusto by the corporate world in a sort of business press but also you know big companies and leadership organizations because people at the top of the chain people like you I think are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system there's too much busyness and it's time to find or get back to that lost part of shifting gears another encouraging sign I think is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea is being taken up and in the developing world in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world state as China Brazil Thailand Poland and so on these countries are have embraced the idea of the slow movement many many people in them and there's a there's debate going on in their media on the streets because I think they're looking at the West and they're saying well we like that aspect of what your you've got but we're not so sure about that so all of that said is it I guess is it possible that's really the main question before us today is it possible to slow down and and I I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes and I present myself as as exhibit a a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speedo holic I still love speed you know I live in London and I work as a journalist and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things I play squash and ice hockey - very fast sports and I wouldn't give them up for the world but I've also over the last year or so got in touch with my inner tortoise and what that means is that I don't I no longer overload myself gratuitous Lane my default mode is no longer to be a Russia holic I no longer hear times winged chariot drawing near or at least not as much as I did before I can I can actually hear it now because I see my time is ticking off and the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier healthier more productive than I ever have I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it and press the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper richer stronger and and for me the I guess the litmus test for whether this would work and what it would mean was always going to be bedtime stories because that's sort of where the journey began and there to the news is is rosy I you know the end of the day I go into my son's room I don't wear a watch I switch off my computer so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket and I just slow down to his pace and and we read and because children have their own tempo and internal clock they don't do quality time you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you they need you to move at their rhythm I find that 10 minutes into a story you know my son will suddenly say you know something happened in the playground today that really bothered me and will go off and have a conversation on that and I now find that bedtime stories used to be a kind of a box unlike to-do list something that I'd read it because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly it's become my reward at the end of the day something I really I really cherish and and I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon which goes a little bit like this a few months ago I was getting ready to go on a another book tour and I had my bags packed I was downstairs by the front door and I was waiting for a taxi my son came down the stairs and he he made a card for me he was carrying it he'd gone and stapled two cards very like these together and put a sticker of his favorite character Tintin on the front and he said to me where he handed his me and and I read it it said to Daddy love Benjamin and I thought oh that's that's really sweet you know is that a good luck on the book tour card and he said no no no daddy this is a card for being the best story reader in the world and I thought yeah you know this slowing down thing really does work thank you very much you"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Carl Honoré says his “wake-up call” about

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/noreena-hertz-how-to-use-experts-and-when-not-to", "transcript": {"en": "it's Monday morning in Washington the President of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office assessing whether or not to strike al Qaeda in Yemen at number 10 Downing Street David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double-dip recession in Madrid Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door listening to her baby crying and crying trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it and I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one and a half liter bottle of water that his doctors just came and came in and said you must make him drink today my father's been milled by mouth for a week or whether by giving him this bottle I might actually kill him we face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions we talk things over with our friends we scared the internet we search through books but still even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon recommends it still experts that we rely upon most especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own and in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confuse Singh we feel reassured by the almost parental like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do but I believe that this is a big problem a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society as a culture and as individuals it's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world of course they have the problem lies with us we've become addicted to experts we've become addicted to their certainty their assuredness their definitiveness and in the process we have ceded our responsibility substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom we've surrendered our power trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide this is no exaggeration in a recent experiment a group of adults had their brain scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak the results were quite extraordinary as they listened to the experts voices the independent decision-making parts of their brains switched off it literally flatlined and they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice however right or wrong the experts do get things wrong did you know that studies show that doctors miss diagnose four times out of ten did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax advisor to do it for yay and then there's of course the example that we're all too aware of of financial experts getting it so wrong that we're living through the worst recession since the 1930s for the sake of our health our wealth and our collective security it's imperative that we keep the independent decision-making parts of our brains switched on and I'm saying this as an economist who over the past few years has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why but also and I'm aware of the irony here as an expert myself as a professor as somebody who advises prime ministers heads of big companies international organizations but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change that we need to become more open-minded more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view so in order to help you understand where I'm coming from let me bring you into my world the world of experts now there are of course exceptions wonderful civilization enhancing exceptions but what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps that within these camps a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition that experts move with the prevailing winds often hero-worshipping their own gurus Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on not challenged by his peers until after the crisis of course you see we also learn that experts are located a governed by the social and cultural norms of their times whether it be the doctors in Victorian England say who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire or the psychiatrists in the United States who up until 1973 was still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness and what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects or studies funded by food companies of of their new products massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market a study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study and we've also got to be aware that experts of course also make mistakes they make mistakes every single day mistakes born out of carelessness a recent study in the archives of surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries operating on the wrong side of the brain carrying out procedures on the wrong hand elbow eye foot and also mistakes born out of thinking errors a common thinking error of radiologists for example when they look at CT scans is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he aspects the patient's problem to be so if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia say what happens is that if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan they literally stop looking at it thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts these are of course not the only insights I could share but I hope they give you a clearer sense at least of why we need to stop Cowtown to them why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision-making capabilities on but how can we do this well for the sake of time I want to focus on just three strategies first we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles this doesn't mean having to get a PhD in every single subject you'll be relieved to hear but it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when for example we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand why was it that when I had an operation my doctor said to me beware miss hurts of hyperpyrexia when he could have just as easily said watch out for a high fever you see being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs their equations their forecasts their prophecies and being armed with the questions to do that questions like what are the assumptions that underpin this what is the evidence upon which this is based what has your investigation focused on and what has it ignored it recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first primarily on male animals and then primarily on men it seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women and women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take being a rebel is about recognizing that experts assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed second we need to create the space for what I call managed descent if we are to shift paradigms if we are to make breakthroughs if we are to destroy myths we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out in which we're bringing in new diverse discordant heretical views into the discussion fearlessly in the knowledge that progress comes about not only from the creation of ideas but also from their destruction and also from the knowledge that by surrounding ourselves by divergent discordant heretical views all the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true and that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent Google's CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy in meetings he looks out for the person in the room arms crossed looking a bit bemused and draws them into the discussion trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion so that they have dissent within the room managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement discord and difference but we need to go even further we need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are the conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees fancy titles diplomas best-selling books high status individuals but just imagine if we were to junk this nation of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEOs but also shopgirls yeah best by the consumer electronics company gets all its employees the cleaners the shop assistants the people in the back office not just its forecasting team to place bets yes bets on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas on whether new customers new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company on whether a project will come in on time by leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company best buy was able to discover for example that the store that it was going to open in China it's big grand store was not going to open on time because when it asked its staff all its staff to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening it turns out that they were where as no one else within the company was of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts nor the experts on the ground on China were even aware of the strategies that I have discussed this evening embracing dissent taking experts on democratizing expertise rebellious strategies are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing complex difficult times for if we keep our independent decision-making part of our brains switched on if we challenge experts if we're skeptical if we devolve Authority if we are rebellious but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance uncertainty and doubt and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the 21st century for now more than ever is not the time to be blindly following blindly accepting blindly trusting now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open yes using experts to help us figure things out for sure I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here but being aware of their

"transcript": {"en": "[Music] [Music] what what is the story of this this is uh breaking the glass ceiling [Music] oh that was well chosen I would say for this what I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what's going to happen you know none of this pined stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein I'll tell you what happened I went to the United Nations as Ambassador and it was after the Gulf War and I was an instructed Ambassador and uh the ceasefire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly which he deserved he had invaded another country and so all of a sudden a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many many things but among them an unparalleled Serpent and so I happened to have a snake pin so I wore it when we talked about Iraq uh and when I went out to Meet the Press they zeroed and said why are you wearing that snake pin I said cuz Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled Serpent and then I thought well this is fun so I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would in fact reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day so that's how it all started oh so how large is the collection then pretty big it's now traveling at the moment it's in Indianapolis but it was at the Smithsonian and it goes with a book that says read my pins so is is this a a good idea I remember when you were um the first woman as as Secretary of State and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing how you looked uh you know the thing that happens to a lot of women especially if they're the first in a position so how do you feel about that the whole well it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing but people did pay attention to what clothes I had what was interesting was that before I went up to New York as un Ambassador I talked to Jean kpatrick who'd been Ambassador before me and she said you got to get rid of your professor clothes go out and look like a diplomat so that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping um but still there were all kinds of questions about did you wear a hat how short was your skirt and one of the things if you remember cona rice was at some event and she wore boots and she got criticized over that and no guy ever gets criticized but that's the least of it it is for all of us men and women finding our ways of defining our roles and uh and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future how how are you how did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomat atic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother a grandmother nurturing and so how how did you handle well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary State a few minutes after I've been named and I said well I've been a woman for 60 years but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes so it evolved but um uh basically I love being a woman and so what happened and I think there'll probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this I went to my first meeting at the um first at the UN and that's when this all started because that is a very male uh organization and I'm sitting there they're 15 members of the security Council so 14 men uh sat there staring at me and I thought well you know how we all are you want to get the feeling of the room and do people like me and and will I really say something intelligent and all of a sudden I thought thought well wait a minute I am sitting behind a sign that says the United States and if I don't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard and it was the first time that I kind of had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal kind of reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country and so uh that happened more and various times but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman um I think we are better A lot at personal relationships uh and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary but I tell you I have my youngest granddaughter when she turned seven last year said to her mother my daughter so what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State only girls are Secretary of State at [Applause] her cuz in her lifetime that would be so what a change that is um as you travel now all over the world which you do frequently how how do you assess This Global narrative around the story of women and girls where are we I think we're slowly changing but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different and therefore means that we have to remember that while many of us have had huge opportun and Pat you have been a real leader in in your field is that um there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women had to help other women and so what I have felt and and I have looked at this from a national security issue when I was Secretary of State I decided that women's issues had to be Central to American foreign policy not just because I'm a feminist but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered uh that u values are passed down the health uh situation is better education is better um there is greater economic Prosperity so I think that it is behooves us uh those of us that live in um various countries where we do have economic and political voice that we need to help other women and I really dedicated myself to that both at the UN and then as Secretary of State and did you get push back from for making that a central tenant of a foreign from some people I think that they thought that it was kind of a soft issue the bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues uh because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many U aspects and because as I said it is really Central to the way that we think about things now for instance uh some of the wars that took place uh when I was um in office a lot of those the women were the main victims of them uh for instance when I started we there were wars in the Balkans um the women in Bosnia were being raped uh we then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically uh with those kinds of issues and by the way one of the things that I did at that stage was I had just arrived at the UN and when I was there there were 183 countries in the UN now they're 192 but it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself so I said to my assistant invite The Other Women permanent representatives and I thought when I'd get to my apartment that there' be a lot of women there I get there and there's six other women out of 183 so the countries that had women representatives were Canada Kazakhstan Philippines Trinidad Tobago Jamaica lonstein and me so being an American I decided to set up a caucus and so uh we we set it up and I we we called ourselves the G7 and um girl girls s and we lobbied on behalf of women's issues so we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal and then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war that it was against humanitarian so when you look around the world and you see that in many any cases certainly in the Western World women are evolving into more leadership positions and and in even in other places some barriers are being brought down but there's still so much violence still so many problems and yet we hear there more women at the negotiating tables now you were at those negotiating tables when there weren't when there was maybe you one voice maybe one or two others do you believe and can you tell us why there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis well I I do think when there are more women that the uh the tone of the conversation changes and also the goals of the conversation change but it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women we you know if you think that you've forgotten high school so the the um uh but uh the bottom line is that I think that there is a way when there are more women uh at the table that there's an attempt to develop some understanding so for instance what I did when I went to Burundi uh we got tosis and hu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda um and so I think the capability of women to put themselves I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy shoes and having more empathy I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room when I was Secretary of State there were only 13 other women foreign ministers um and so it was nice when one of them would show up for instance uh she is now the president of Finland but Taria henan was the foreign minister of Finland and at a certain stage head of the European Union and it was really terrific because one of the things I think you'll understand we went to a a meting and the men in my delegation when I would say well I feel we should do something about this and they'd say what do you mean feel and so then uh Taria was sitting across the table from me and all of a sudden and we were talking about arms control and she said well I feel we should do this and you know my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden but I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of um foreign policy positions the other thing that I think is really important a lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy but it's about budgets and Military budgets and how the debts of countries work out so if you have women in a variety of uh foreign policy posts they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries so how do we get um you know this balance we're looking for than in the world more women's voices at the table more men who believe that the balance is best what well I think one of the things I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the national Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office to um figure out how they can in fact develop political voices I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about because I am of a certain age where when I started in my career believe it or not there were other women who criticized me why aren't you in the carpool line or uh aren't your children suffering because you're not there all the time and I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty in fact I think guilt is every woman's middle name and so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other and my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other but secretary Albright I guess you'll be going to heaven thank you for joining us today thanks [Applause] Pat"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In the wake of the

"transcript": {"en": "[Music] [Applause] you have brought us images from the Yemen times and take us through those and introduce us to another Yen well um I'm glad to be here and I would like to share with you all some of the big pictures that are happening today in Yemen uh this picture shows a revolution started by women and it shows women and men uh leading a mixed uh protest the other picture um is popularity of the real need for change so many people are there the intensity of uh of the upspring this picture shows that the revolution has allowed opportunities for training uh for Education these women women are learning about first aid and their rights according to the Constitution I love this picture I just wanted to show that over 60% of the yemeni population are 15 years and below and they were excluded from decision making and now they are in the Forefront of the news raising the flag English uh you will see this is um uh genes and and tights and and in English uh expression you know the ability to share with the world what is going on in our own country and uh expression also um it has brought Talent yemenese are using cartoons and um art paintings Comics to tell the world and each other about what's going on obviously there's always the dark side of it and this is just a one of the less gruesome pictures of uh of the Revolution and the cost that we have to pay the solidarity of millions of yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing and finally lots of people are saying that Yemen's Revolution is going to break the country um is it going to be so many different countries is it going to be another Somalia but we want to tell the world that no under the one flag will still remain as yemeni people thank you for those images um Nadia and they do in many ways tell a different story than the story of Yemen the one that is often in the news and yet you yourself defy all those characterizations so let's talk about the personal story for a moment your your father is is murdered um the Yemen times already has a strong reputation in Yemen as an independent English language newspaper how did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper especially in such times of conflict well let me first warn you that I am not the the traditional yemeni girl I guess you've already noticed this by now um in Yemen most women are failed and they are sitting behind doors and not very much part of the public life but there's so much potential I wish I could show you my Yemen I wish you could see the the emen through my eyes then you will know that there so much to it and I was privileged because I was born into a family my father would always encourage the boys and the girls he would say he would say we are equal and he was such an extraordinary man and even my mother I owe it to my family um a story um I studied in India and in my third year I started becoming confused because uh I was yemeni but I was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college and I went back home and I said Daddy I don't know who I am I'm not a Yemen I'm not an Indian and he said you are the bridge and that is something I will keep in my heart forever so since then I've been the bridge and a lot of people have walked over me but I don't think so but it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society and when I became Editor in Chief after my brother actually my father passed away in 99 then my brother until 2005 and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it what's this young girl coming and showing off because she it's her family business or or something it was very hard at first I didn't want want to clash with people but with all due respect to all the men and the older men especially they did not want me a WRA it was very hard you know to to impose uh my authority but a woman's got to do what a woman's got to [Laughter] [Music] do and in the first year I had to fire half of the men brought in more women brought in younger men and we have a more gender balanced Newsroom today uh the other thing is that it's about professionalism it's about proving who you are and what you can do and I don't know if I'm going to be boasting now but in 2006 alone we won three international Awards one of them is the IPI free media Pioneer award so that was the answer to all the Yemen people and I want to score a point here because my husband is in the room over there if you could please stand up here he has been very supportive of me and we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper but in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have uh you have become a bridge between a an old or and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper and so along with changing who work there you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into in particular with women and it has to do with outside image dress um the veiled woman so how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who work for you as you know the image of yemeni women is a lot of black and covered uh veiled women and this is true and a lot of it is because of women are not able or not free to to show their Fai to their self it's a lot of traditional imposing coming by authority figures such as the men the grandparents and so on and it's economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say I am as much contributing to this family or more than than you are and the more empowered the women become the more they are able to take to remove the veil for example or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel so the other face of Yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil and it's economic empowerment mostly that allows the women to just uncover it and I have done this throughout my work I've tried to encourage young girls um we started with like you can take it off in the office uh and then after that you can take it off on assignments because I didn't believe a journalist can be a journalist with with you know how can you talk to people if you have your face covered and so on it's just a movement and I am a role model in y and a lot of people look up to me a lot of young girls look up to me and I need to prove to them that yes you can still be married you can still be a mother and you can still be respected societ in the society but in the same time that doesn't mean that you just be one of the crowd you can be yourself and and have your face but by putting yourself personally out there both projecting a different image of Yemen women but also what you have have made possible for the women who work at the paper has this uh put you in personal danger well the human times cross 20 years has been through so much uh We've suffered prosecution the paper was closed down more the three times it's an independent newspaper but tell that to the people in charge they they think that if there's anything against them that then we are being an opposition newspaper and um very very very difficult times uh some of my reporters were arrested we had some court cases my father was assassinated um today we are in a much better situation we've created The credibility and in a times of Revolution or change like today it is very important for Independent Media to have a voice it's very important for you for for you to go to Y times.com and it is very important to to listen to our voice um and this is probably something I want to I want to share with you uh on Western media probably and how um there's a lot of stereotypes uh thinking of Yemen in one single frame this is what Yemen is all about and um that's not fair it's not fair for me it's not fair for my country a lot of reporters come to Yemen and they want to write a story on Al-Qaeda or terrorism and um I just wanted to to share with you like there's one reporter that came he wanted to do a document on uh what his editors wanted um and he landed up writing about story that even surprised me hip hop that there are Yemen young Yemen men who uh Express themselves through dancing and and um that thing rap break dancing yeah break dancing I'm not so old I'm just not in touch [Music] yes you are actually that's a documentary that's available online the videoos online it is shaketh dust. org yeah Shake the Dust Shake the Dust shaketh dust. org and it definitely does give a different image of Yem and you spoke about the responsibility of the press and certainly when we look at the ways in which we have you know separated ourselves from others we've been we've created fear and and danger often from lack of of knowledge lack of real understanding how do you see the way that the Western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region but in particular in your country well um there is a thing that says uh you you fear what you don't know and you hate what you fear so it's about the lack of research basically it's almost do your homework you know some involvement and you cannot do what parachute reporting you know just jump into a country for two days and think that you've done your homework and uh stories so uh I wish that the world would know my Yemen my country my people I am an example and there are others like me we may not be that many but if if we are uh promoted as um you know an a good positive example there will be others uh men and women who can eventually bridge the gap again coming to the bridge between Yemen and the world and telling us um first about recognition and then about communication and compassion um I think Y is going to be in very bad situation in the next two or three years it's natural um but after the two years which is the price we are willing to pay we were going to stand up again on our feet but in the new Yemen with the younger and more empowered people Democratic Nadia I think you've just given us a very different view of Yemen and certainly you yourself and what you do have uh given us a view of the future that thank you it's my honor will Embrace and be grateful for thank you and the very best of luck to you Yemen times.com on Twitter also so you are plugged in [Applause] yeah [Applause] yeah"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What does Al-Sakkaf have to say about Yemeni

{"page": 74, "lesson": 6, "title": "Why it pays to work hard - Richard St. John", "category": "Motivation and Emotion", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/richard-st-john-why-it-pays-to-work-hard", "transcript": {"en": "(Music) Eight to be great: The eight traits successful people have in common. Number two: work. When I was interviewing all these successful people, they kept telling me how hard they worked. And I remember standing there thinking, \"Ah, jeez, another comment about work? Why don't they tell me the real secret to their success?\" Then finally I realized, hard work is a real secret to their success. All successful people work very hard. Martha Stewart said to me, \"I'm a real hard worker. I work and work and work all the time.\" Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch said, \"It's all hard work. Nothing comes easily. But I have a lot of fun.\" Did he say fun? Yes. Successful people have fun working. That's why I say they're not really workaholics. They're workafrolics. Jim Pattison, chairman of the Jim Pattison Group, is a workafrolic. He says, \"Business is my recreation. I'd rather go to our factories and meet with our people than go to the beach, I can tell you that.\" Dave Lavery, the NASA whiz who builds those robots for Mars, said to me, \"We work our fingers to the bone. But it doesn't seem like work. It's fun. It's what we want to do. We don't want to put things down and go home.\" Bill Gates is a workafrolic. Even after he was a multimillionaire, he worked most nights until 10 p.m., and only took two weeks off in seven years. And he probably spent them on his computer. Oprah is a workafrolic. She says, \"I never see daylight. I'd come into work at 5:30 in the morning when it was dark, and leave at 7 or 8 when it was dark.\" I'm a workafrolic. And over the years, I've gone through many days and even weeks without much sleep, just because I was having so much fun. And I gotta admit, at times like that you say to yourself, \"Am I the only one working this hard?\" Because there's a myth it comes easy to some people. You turn on the TV, nobody's working that hard. A guy like Chris Rock stands up on stage, tells a few jokes. What's hard about that? But even Chris says, \"I wasn't the funniest guy growing up, but I was the guy who worked on being funny the hardest.\" Trust me. I've interviewed over 500 successful people, not one of them said it came easy, even though they were doing what they loved. We tend to underestimate work and overestimate talent. But in the end, work tops talent. Arthur Benjamin, America's best math whiz, said to me, \"I think numbers and I have always gotten along. But I'm sure my 'talent' is just due to the time and hours and work that I've put into it.\" Many talented people don't achieve as much success as they could, unfortunately, because they sit back on their talent and never learn to work hard. That's what happened to Michael Jordan when he first started playing basketball. He had the talent, but he wasn't putting in the work, and the coach actually cut him from the high school basketball team. Boy, that was a wake-up call. He says, \"I was very disappointed. I started working on my game the day after I was cut.\" And he soon became the hardest working player in basketball, who made fun of the other players who weren't working hard. And that hard work is what made him the greatest basketball player of all time. So I'd say the real gift isn't talent, it's the ability to work hard. And we tend to underestimate work and overestimate smarts. But in the end, work wins over smarts. In fact, many successful people aren't the smartest, they just work the hardest. Francois Parenteau, who Business Week called the top independent analyst on Wall Street, said to me, \"I'm certainly not that smart. I can't even remember my own zip code.\" But he also says, \"Work is a big part of my life. I think about investments pretty much 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\" Nez Hallett III is CEO of Smart Wireless, and I thought, that's ironic because he told me he's not that smart. He says, \"I graduated from high school with a C average, and college with a C-minus average.\" But now the smart PhD's are reporting to him. How did he do it? He said, \"If you're going to be successful at anything, the key thing is to work hard.\" I'm not smart. As proof, here's my actual 12th grade report card. It was the only one my parents ever kept. Don't ask me why they kept it; it's nothing to brag about. As you can see, I was a C student, not an A student. I don't think I'd even make it into college these days. So how did I achieve some success and wealth? I just worked hard, many 60- to 80-hour weeks. And now I know I'm not alone. Thomas Stanley studied hundreds of millionaires, and he discovered most millionaires weren't A students, didn't score high on tests and teachers didn't think they'd ever succeed. But they did succeed, because they worked hard. So the good news is if you're not the smartest, if you're a C student, not an A student, the really good news is you can still succeed. Because the word \"success\" has two C's and no A's. (Laughter) You can still succeed as long as you work hard. And what if you are smart? Well, I'm sorry, there's absolutely no hope for you. Because many smart people don't achieve as much success as they could, unfortunately, because they rest on their smarts and never learn to work hard. Jeong Kim, president of Lucent Technologies, says, \"People who are the smartest sometimes don't realize their full potential, because things get too easy, so they don't push themselves hard.\" After a talk I gave at one of the world's top 10 business schools, a man came up to me and said, \"You know, when I got my MBA here a few years ago, I was one of the smartest people in the class. I thought I had it made. So after I graduated, I sat back and I didn't work hard. And I went downhill. And now, at this point in my life, I've gone nowhere. I haven't achieved any success at all.\" He said, \"Thanks for the wake-up call. Now I know what I need to do. I need to work.\" So the bottom line is, whether you're smart or not, whether you're talented or not, just keep working.

The words on the screen, the images, the colors, the sounds, the angle of the camera, every detail is designed to make you think, act or feel a certain way. Your brain is subconsciously decoding images and sounds, and just by being alive today, by interacting with and reading all these different types of media, you're already an expert at decoding and understanding these hidden messages. A set of codes and conventions that work together to make you feel happy, angry, afraid, excited. To make you want to buy a particular product -- a refreshing drink, a new phone. To style your hair a certain way. To cheer for the hero or boo the villain. Welcome to the family tree of technical codes. So what constitutes a code? First of all, it has to be recognized by all who read it. Imagine a busy city where motorists don't know how to read the traffic signals. We all have to know red equals stop, green means go, for the system to work. Otherwise it would be chaos. Secondly, codes are made meaningful by their context. We can't fully interpret or decipher a code until we see how it relates to other signs and symbols. Look at these two intersecting lines. Without any context, things around the code to help you understand or make meaning from it, it's hard to know exactly what these lines represent. They could be a cross, symbolizing religion, an add sign, symbolizing a mathematical concept, the letter T from the alphabet, or they could just be two lines intersecting. If we add a crescent moon shape, and a circle with a line on it in front, the two lines now have a context, a relationship to their surroundings, and are magically revealed as the letter T. By adding additional information around the code, we've changed its context, and therefore given it a concrete meaning. Let's meet the family. Technical Codes, Senior has three sons: Symbolic Codes, Written Codes and Technical Codes, Junior. Symbolic Codes has three sons: Symbolic Color, Symbolic Objects and Symbolic Animals. This branch of the family is all about representation. Red represents hot or stop or danger, depending on its context. So if you see a red light above a yellow and a green light on a pole above the road, you know by this context that the light represents stop. Written Codes has three sons: You and Only You, Buzzwords and Catchphrase. These guys are all about saying a lot with a little, or planting a word in your subconscious that triggers a response whenever you hear or read it. Have you noticed how many times I've said the word \"you?\" You should feel like it's directed specifically at you, and only you, that it's addressing your needs and desire to learn about your world. If I tell you that all the cool, fresh and hip people are buying a new drink or wearing a particular brand, the buzzwords \"new,\" \"fresh\" or \"free\" make the product seem more interesting and appealing. If I wrap that product or idea in a simple phrase that's easy to remember and becomes part of your everyday speech, then every time you hear or say those few words, your brain connects them to the product. So Just Do It, Think Different, and Enjoy the power of the catchphrase. And Technical Codes, Junior has three sons: Camera Angles, Framing and Lighting. For these boys, it's all about how the camera is placed, how objects, people and places are shot, and what we see on screen -- or just as importantly, what we don't see. When the camera is placed high above the subject, it makes you look small, insignificant and powerless. And the reverse is also true, when the camera is below. So is this video trying to manipulate you to buy something? Yes, an idea. The idea that understanding the relationship between technical codes and the role they play in shaping your understanding of the world around us through the media we consume is fun and interesting. Is it trying to make you feel a certain way? Absolutely. Every image, every word, has been carefully crafted to work together to make you feel positive about the idea that you need to be educated to engage with what you read, watch and listen to in movies, TV shows, magazines and on the Internet. By understanding these codes, and how they work together to subconsciously change the way you think, feel and act towards products and ideas, you'll be aware of these techniques and able to identify their impact on you. One of the most powerful advertising mediums in the world is word of mouth. If you've ever recommended a product or movie, a service, or even a video online, then you've played your part in passing the message. So soak all this information up. Recognize how the family tree of technical codes works on you, and those around you, to make an impact Find excellent examples, and spread the word."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Through which of these channels do you absorb information?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Television"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Movies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Magazines"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Internet"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What's the first thing that constitutes a code?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It has to be recognized by all who read it."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It has to incorporate color, imagery, sound, and writing."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It must be in television, magazines, or movies."}, {"label": "D", "text": "At least a certain group of people must use it regularly."}, {"label": "E", "text": "It must be fun."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Technical Codes Sr. has three sons.

I couldn't pass the height requirement. (Laughter) And I couldn't motivate anybody. My employees actually call me\na de-motivational speaker. (Laughter) What I try to be\nis an informational speaker. I went out and found out\nsome information about success, and I'm just here to pass it on. And my story started over\nten years ago, on a plane. I was on my way\nto the TED conference in California, and in the seat next to me\nwas a teenage girl, and she came from a really poor family,\nbut she wanted to get somewhere in life. And as I tapped away on my computer,\nshe kept asking me questions, and then out of the blue,\nshe asked, \"Are you successful?\" I said, \"No, I'm not successful.\" Terry Fox, my hero,\nnow there's a big success. He lost a leg to cancer,\nthen ran thousands of miles and raised millions for cancer research. Or Bill Gates,\na guy who owns his own plane and doesn't have to sit\nnext to some kid asking him questions. (Laughter) But then I told her\nabout some of the stuff I'd done. I love communications,\nand I've won lots of awards in marketing. I love running, and I still sometimes\nwin my age group, old farts over 60. (Laughter) My fastest marathon\nis two hours and 43 minutes to run the 26 miles, or 42 kilometers. I've run over 50 marathons,\nin all 7 continents. This was a run my wife and I did\nup the Inca trail to Machu Picchu in Peru. And to qualify for the 7 continents, we had to run a marathon in Antarctica. But when we got there,\nit didn't look nice and calm like this, it looked like this. The waves were so high,\nwe couldn't get to shore. So we sailed 200 miles further south\nto where the seas were calm and ran the entire 26-mile marathon on the boat. 422 laps around the deck\nof that little boat. My wife and I have also climbed\ntwo of the world's seven summits, the highest mountains on each continent. We climbed Aconcagua, the highest\nmountain on the American continent, and Kilimanjaro,\nthe highest mountain in Africa. Well, to be honest, I puked my way\nto the top of Kilimanjaro, I got altitude sickness. I got no sympathy from my wife. She passed me and did a lap around the top while I was still struggling up there. In spite of that, we're still together\nand have been for over 35 years. (Applause) I'd say that's a success these days. So I said to the girl, \"Well, you know,\nI guess I have had some success.\" And then she said,\n\"Okay, so are you a millionaire?\" (Laughter) Now, I didn't know what to say, because when I grew up,\nit was bad manners to talk about money. But I figured I'd better be honest, and I said, \"Yeah. I'm a millionaire. But I don't know how it happened. I never went after the money,\nand it's not that important to me.\" She said, \"Maybe not to you,\nbut it is to me. I don't want to be poor all my life. I want to get somewhere,\nbut it's never going to happen.\" I said, \"Well, why not?\" She said, \"Well, you know,\nI'm not very smart. I'm not doing great in school.\" I said, \"So what? I'm not smart.\nI barely passed high school. I had absolutely nothing going for me. I was never voted most popular\nor most likely to succeed. I started a whole new category\n-- most likely to fail. But in the end, I did okay.\nSo if I can do it, you can do it.\" And then she asked me the big question: \"Okay, so what really leads to success?\" I said, \"Jeez, sorry. I don't know. I guess somehow I did it.\nI don't know how I did it.\" So I get off the plane\nand go to the TED conference, and I'm standing in a room full\nof extraordinarily successful people in many fields -- business, science, arts, health, technology, the environment -- when it hit me: Why don't I ask them\nwhat helped them succeed, and find out what really\nleads to success for everyone? So I was all excited to get out there\nand start talking to these great people, when the self-doubt set in. I mean, why would people\nwant to talk to me? I'm not a famous journalist.\nI'm not even a journalist. So I was ready to stop the project\nbefore it even began, when who comes walking\ntowards me but Ben Cohen, the famous co-founder\nof Ben and Jerry's ice cream. I figured it was now or never. I pushed through the self-doubt, jumped out in front of him, and said, \"Ben, I'm working on this project. I don't even know what to ask you, but can you tell me\nwhat helped you succeed?\" He said, \"Yeah, sure, come on.\nLet's go for a coffee.\" And over coffee and ice cream,\nBen told me his story. Now here we are over 10 years later, and I've interviewed\nover 500 successful people face-to-face, and collected\nthousands of other success stories. I wanted to find the common factors\nfor success in all fields, so I had to interview people\nin careers ranging from A to Z. These are just the careers I interviewed\nbeginning with the letter A, and in most cases more than one person. I interviewed six successful accountants, five corporate auditors,\nfive astronauts who had been into space, four actors who had won\nthe Academy Award for Best Actor, three of the world's top astrophysicists, six of the world's leading architects and, oh yeah, four Nobel Prize winners. Yeah, I know it doesn't start with A,\nbut it's kind of cool. (Laughter) And I want to say a sincere thanks to all the great people\nthat I've interviewed over the years. This really is their story;\nI'm just the messenger. The really big job was taking\nall the interviews and analyzing them,\nword by word, line by line, and sorting them into all the factors\nthat people said helped them succeed. And then you start to see the big factors\nthat are common to most people's success. Altogether, I analyzed\nand sorted millions of words. Do you know how much work that is? That's all I do, day and night --\nsort and analyze. I'll tell you, if I ever get my hands\non that kid on the plane -- (Laughter) Actually, if I do, I'll thank her. Because I've never had so much fun\nand met so many interesting people. And now, I can answer her question. I discovered the 8 traits\nsuccessful people have in common, or the 8 to be great: Love what you do; work really hard; focus on one thing, not everything; keep pushing yourself;\ncome up with good ideas; keep improving yourself and what you do; serve others something of value, because\nsuccess isn't just about me, me, me; and persist, because\nthere's no overnight success. Why did I pick these? Because when I added up\nall the comments in my interviews, more people said\nthose 8 things helped them than anything else. The eight traits are really\nthe heart of success, the foundation, and then on top we build\nthe specific skills that we need for our particular\nfield or career. Technical skills, analytical skills,\npeople skills, creative skills -- lots of other skills we can add on top, depending on our field. But no matter what field we're in, these eight traits will be\nat the heart of our success. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Meeting one person can change your life.

{"page": 74, "lesson": 9, "title": "The power of passion - Richard St. John", "category": "Motivation and Emotion", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/richard-st-john-the-power-of-passion", "transcript": {"en": "(Music) The eight traits successful people have in common. Number one: passion. Successful people love what they do. When I asked Russell Crowe what led to his Academy Award for Best Actor, he said, \"The bottom line is I love the actual job of acting. I have a great passion for it.\" Successful people in all fields love what they do, whether it's astrophysicist Jaymie Matthews, author J.K. Rowling or athlete Michael Phelps. And not just big names -- Margaret MacMillan, a history professor, says, \"I spent my life doing what I loved.\" Carlos, a bus driver I sit with at Starbucks, says, \"I love what I do. I've only missed three days in four years.\" And believe it or not, even successful dentists love what they do. Izzy Novak says, \"I love dentistry. I can't imagine being anything else.\" But what about business? Many of you are in business, and we tend to think that business is more about cold numbers than hot passion, more about logic than love, so what surprised me was how often successful business people actually use the words \"passion\" or \"love\" when they talk about their work. When Jack Welch was CEO of General Electric, he was asked if he liked his job. He said, \"No, I don't like this job. I love this job.\" We can have passion for a profession. Kathleen Lane, chief strategist at WorkCar, says, \"I've found a profession I love.\" She also says, \"Stress isn't working 15 hours at a job you like, stress is working 15 minutes at a job you dislike.\" We can have a passion for people. Nez Hallett III, CEO of Smart Wireless, says, \"I used to be in sales. Now I'm a CEO. I just love being around people.\" We can have passion for a product. James Dyson, the vacuum cleaner guy, says, \"I love vacuum cleaners, and I will love them until the day I die.\" (Laughter) Yup, when he dies, they're just going to cremate him and suck up those ashes with a Dyson vacuum, and place it on the shelf. (Laughter) We can have passion for a particular field. Anita Roddick, the great founder of The Body Shop, once said, \"I love retailing. I love buying and selling and making connections.\" She also said, \"I don't like systems, financial sheets or plans.\" Yes, no matter how much we love what we do, there's always going to be stuff we don't love. The trick is to make sure the stuff you don't love only takes up 20 percent of your time, and the stuff you do love takes up 80. If it's the other way around, we're in the wrong job. Passion is sometimes mistaken for ambition. People call Donald Trump ambitious, but he says, \"I'm not ambitious. I just love what I do. And if you love what you do, you do a lot of stuff. And then people say, 'Oh, you're ambitious.'\" The cool thing about passion is it turns underachievers into superachievers. I have a long list of famous underachievers -- like Albert Einstein -- who people said would go nowhere when they were young. For instance, who said this, besides me? \"I was sitting in my room being a depressed guy, trying to figure out what I was doing with my life.\" Turns out it was Bill Gates. Bill was such an underachiever, his parents actually sent him to counseling. Yeah, I can just hear the neighbors back then saying, \"Jeez, that Gates kid. What a loser. He's never going to go anywhere.\" And he didn't, until he discovered his passion for software. The big problem is finding your passion. Sure, there's the kid that knows they want to be an accountant or an architect or an astronaut from the time they're 10, but I found a much bigger group of successful people who, when they were young, and even when they were older, didn't have a clue what their passion was, and it took them a long time to find it or to fall into it. Dawn Lepore, Chief Information Officer at Charles Schwab, said to me, \"I fell into what I do, and I didn't know I loved it until I fell into it.\" And I hear that a lot. So how do people find their passion? Well they just get out there and try a lot of stuff and explore many paths. Robert Munsch explored many paths. He said to me, \"I studied to be a priest and that turned out to be a disaster. I tried working on a farm. They didn't like me. I worked on a boat. It sank. I tried a lot of things that didn't work, but I kept trying and then I tried something that did work.\" And I'd say it worked; as a children's author, he's sold over 40 million books. Yes, finding a job we love is like finding a person we love. Sometimes we've just got to go on a lot of really bad dates before we find the right one. Now, I read a survey of 18- to 25-year-olds, and 81 percent said their first or second life goal was to get rich. And I thought, boy, they've got it all wrong. Because I've interviewed many millionaires and billionaires, and guess how many of them said their life goal was to get rich? Zero! They didn't do it for money, they did it for love. They went for the zing, not the ka-ching ka-ching. When Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Microsoft, they didn't do it for the money. Bill says, \"Paul and I never thought we'd make much money. We just loved writing software.\" And with that attitude, he became the richest man in the world. J.K. Rowling didn't write Harry Potter books for the money. She said, \"I love writing these books. I just wanted to make enough money to continue to write.\" And with that attitude, she became a billionaire. I became a millionaire by following my heart, not my wallet, and a number of times I walked away from great-paying jobs to do poor-paying jobs I loved better. Once was when I had a great job, traveling the world, making a lot of money, but I wasn't doing the one thing I loved at the time, which was photography. So I said, I think I'll leave and start my own little photo company. My heart said, Yeah! Go for it. My wallet, and all my friends, I might add, said, Are you crazy? You can't walk away from all the money! You'll starve. I didn't listen to them. I walked away, and yeah, at first there wasn't much money, but it didn't matter, because I was having fun doing what I loved. And eventually, the money came, and much more than if I'd stayed in my old job. So I learned it's true, what they say: If you do what you love, the money comes anyway. So I'd say if you really want to get rich, put money at the bottom of your goals list and passion at the top. And why does it work that way? Because if you love what you do, you automatically do the other seven things that lead to success and wealth. You will work hard, you will push yourself, you will persist. And what if you're in a job you don't love? Well, just follow your passion on the side. Remember, Albert Einstein was a patent clerk. That was his job, but his passion was physics. And he wrote four of his most important papers in his spare time as a hobby, and became one of the world's greatest scientists. So it's amazing what you can do if you love what you do.

{"page": 74, "lesson": 10, "title": "One is one...or is it? - Christopher Danielson", "category": "Numbers & Operations", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/one-is-one-or-is-it", "transcript": {"en": "Which is correct: \"A dozen eggs is?\"\nOr \"A dozen eggs are?\" I remember being in elementary school, and my teachers making\na big deal about the unit. And I never really got that, until one day, I was in the grocery store, and I wanted to buy an apple,\nbut I couldn't buy one apple. I had to buy a whole bag of apples. So I did. I bought one bag of apples, I took it home, I took one apple\nout of the bag, and I cut it up. And then I ate one slice. One bag, one apple, one slice. Which of these is the real \"one\"? Well, they all are of course, and that's what my elementary\nteachers were trying to tell me. Because this is the important idea\nbehind whole number place value, decimal place value and fractions. Our whole number system depends on being able to change\nwhat we count as \"one\". Our whole number system\ndepends on being able to change units. There are two ways to change units. We can compose, and we can partition. When we compose units, we take a bunch of things, we put them\ntogether to make a bigger thing, like a dozen eggs. We take 12 eggs,\nput them together to make a group, and we call that group a dozen. A dozen eggs is a composed unit. Other examples of composed units include a deck of cards,\na pair of shoes, a jazz quartet and of course,\nBarbie and Ken make a couple. But think about a loaf of bread. That's not a composed unit, because we don't get a bunch of slices\nfrom a bunch of different bakeries and put them together to make a loaf. No, we start with a loaf of bread and we cut it into smaller\npieces called slices, so each slice of bread\nis a partitioned unit. Other examples of partitioned units include a square of a chocolate bar,\na section of an orange and a slice of pizza. The important thing about units\nis that once we've made a new unit, we can treat it\njust like we did the old unit. We can compose composed units, and we can partition partitioned units. Think about toaster pastries. They come in packs of two, and then those packs\nget put together in sets of four to make a box. So when I buy one box of toaster pastries, am I buying one thing, four things, or eight things? It depends on the unit. One box, four packs, eight pastries. And when I share\na slice of pizza with a friend, we have to cut \"it\"\ninto two smaller pieces. So a box of toaster pastries\nis composed of composed units, and when I split a slice of pizza, I'm partitioning a partitioned unit. But what does that have to do with math? In math, everything is certain. Two plus two equals four, and one is just one. But that's not really right. One isn't always one. Here's why: we start counting at one, and we count up to nine:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and then we get to 10,\nand in order to write 10, we write a one and a zero. That one means that we have one group, and the zero helps us remember that it means one group, not one thing. But 10, just like one, just like a dozen eggs, just like an egg, 10 is a unit. And 10 tens make 100. So when I think about 100, it's like the box of toaster pastries. Is 100 one thing, 10 things or 100 things? And that depends on what \"one\" is, it depends on what the unit is. So think about all the times in math\nwhen you write the number one. No matter what place that one is in, no matter how many things\nthat one represents, one is."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is an example of a composed unit?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An egg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A loaf of bread"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A deck of cards"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A slice of pizza"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is an example of a partitioned unit?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An egg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A slice of bread"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A deck of cards"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A slice of pizza"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The number one hundred can be thought of as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 unit"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10 units"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100 units"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above; depending on the unit"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "An example of a unit composed of composed units is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A dozen eggs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A box of toaster pastries"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The number 100"}, {"label": "D", "text": "b and c"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What are you doing when you split a slice of pizza?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Partitioning a partitioned unit"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Composing a composed unit"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Creating a new mathematical phenomenon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Doing your friends a favor"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/john-wooden-on-true-success", "transcript": {"en": "[Music] [Applause] I coined my own def definition of success in 1934 when I was teaching at a high school in South Bend Indiana being a little bit uh um disappointed and delusioned perhaps by the way parents of the youngster in my English classes expected their youngsters to to get an A or B they thought a c was all right for the neighbor's children because the neighbors children are all average but they weren't satisfied with their own would make the teacher feel that they had failed or the youngster failed and and that's not right the good Lord and his infant wisdom didn't create us all equal as far as intelligence concerned any more than equal for size appearance not everybody could earn an a be I didn't like that way of judging and and I did know how the alumni of various schools back in the 30s judged coaches and athletic teams if you won them all you were considered to be reasonably successful not completely because I found out uh we had a number of years at UCLA where we didn't lose a game but it seemed that we didn't win each individual game with the margin that some of our alumni had predicted and quite frequently I quite frequently I I really felt that they had backed up their predictions in a more materialistic uh manner but I was threw back in the 30s so I understood that so but I didn't like it I didn't agree with it and I wanted to come up with something that I hope could make me a better teacher and give the youngsters under my supervision whether it be an Athletics or in the English classroom something to which to Aspire other than just uh a higher Mark in the classroom or more points in some athletic contest and I thought about that for quite a spell and I wanted to come up with my own definition I thought that might help and uh I knew how Mr Webster defined it as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of position of power or Prestige or something of that sort wory accomplishments perhaps but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success so I want to come up something of my own and I recalled uh I was raised on a small farm in Southern Indiana and Dad tried to teach me of my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else I'm sure at the time uh he did that I didn't it didn't well somewhere I guess in the hidden recess of the mind it popped out years later never try to be better than someone else always learn from others and never cease trying to be the best you could be that's under your control and if you get too engrossed and involved and concerned in regard to things over which you have no control it will adversely affect the things over which you have control then I ran across a simple verse that said at God's foot stol to confess a poor soul knelt and bowed his head I failed he cried the master said thou did thy best that is Success from those things and one other perhaps I coin my own definition of success which is peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you're capable I believe that's true if you make the effort to do the best of which you're capable trying to improve the situation that exists for you I think that's success and I don't think others can judge that I think it's like character and reputation your reputation is what you're perceiv to be your character is what you really are and I think the character is much more important than what you were perceived to be You' hoped they'd both be good but they not necessarily be the same well that was my idea that what I was going to try to get across to the youngsters I ran across other things I love to teach and it was mentioned uh by the previous speaker that that I enjoy poetry and I dabble in it a bit and love it there are some things that helped me I think be better than I would have been I know I'm not what I ought to be not what I should be but I think I'm better than I would have been if I hadn't run across certain things and one was it just a little verse that said um no no written word no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be nor all the books on all the shelves is what the teachers are themselves that made an impression on me in in the in the 1930s and and um I tried to use that uh more or less in my teaching whether it be in sports or whether it be in the English classroom and I I I I love poetry and all we had an interest in that and somehow and and maybe it's because Dad and used to read to us at night Co o lamp we didn't have electricity uh in our farm home and they had to read poetry to us so I always liked it and about the same time that I ran across this one verse I ran across another one that someone asked a a lady teacher why she taught and she after some time she said she want to think about that and then she came up and said they ask me why I teach and I reply where could I find such Splendid company there sits a Statesman strong unbiased wise another later Webster silver tonged a doctor sits beside him whose quick Steady Hand May mend a bone or stem the life Bloods flow and there a builder upward R is the arch of that church he builds wherein that Minister may speak the word of God and lead us some school to touch the Christ and all about a gathering of teachers Farmers Merchants laborers those who work and vote and Bild and plan and pray and pray into a great tomorrow and I may say I may not see the church or hear the word or eat the food their hands May grow but yet again I may and later I may say I knew him once and he was weak or strong or bold or proud or gay I knew him once but then he was a boy they ask me why I teach and I reply where could I find such Splendid company and I believe the teaching profession it's true you have so many youngsters I got think of my youngsters UCLA 30 some attorneys 11 dentists 10 doctors U many many teachers and and in in other professions and that that gives you a great deal of pleasure to see them go on I I always tried to make the youngsters feel that they're there to get an education number one basketball was second because he paying their way and they do need a little time for social activities but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two and you're not going to have any very long so that was the ideas that I I tried to uh to get across uh to the youngsters under my supervision I had three rules pretty much that I stuck with practically all the time I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA and I decided they were very important one was never be late never be late um later on I had I said certain things that I had the players if were leaving for someone they had to be neat and clean there was a night a time when I I made them wear um jackets and chirch and ties but and then I saw our Chancellor coming to school in L in denims and in turtlenecks and I thought it little not right for me to keep this other so I let them just they had to be neat and clean and I had one of my uh one of my greatest players that you probably heard of Bill Walton he came gu the bus we were leaving for somewhere and to play and he wasn't clean neat so I I would let him go he couldn't get on the bus he had to go home and and get cleaned up to get to the airport if he get so I I was a stickler for that I believed in that I believe in time very important I believe you should be on time but I felt it practices for example we start on time we close on time the youngsters didn't have to feel that we're going to keep them over when I speak at coaching clinics I often Tell Young coaches in the coaching clinics more more or less they'll be the younger coaches getting in the in the profession and and most of them are young you know and and probably newly married and I tell them don't run practices late because you'll go home in a bad mood and then that's not good for a young married man to go home in a bad mood when you get older when you get older don't make any difference but [Music] uh so I did believe on time I believe starting on time and I believe closing on time and another one I had was not one word of profanity one word of profanity and you you are out of here for the day if I see it in a game you're going come out and sit on the bench and the third one was never criticized a teammate I I didn't want that I used to tell them I was paid to do that that's my job I'm paid to do it pitifully poor but I am paid to do it not like the coaches today for gracious sakes no uh it's a little different than that was in my day but those are three things that I stuck with pretty closely all the time and uh those actually came from my dad and that's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time I came up with a a pyramid eventually that I'm not going we don't have the time to go on that but that to help me I think become a better teacher and this is something like this and I had blocks in the pyramid and uh the cornerstones being industrious and enthusiasm working hard and enjoying what you're doing coming up to the Apex uh according to my definition of success and right the top faith and patience and I say to you and whatever you're doing you must be patient you have to have patience to we want things to happen to us we talk about our youth being impatient a lot and they are uh they won't change everything they think all change is progress and we get a little older we sort of let things go and we forget that there is no progress without change so you must have patience and I believe that we must have faith I believe that we must believe really believe not just not just give it word service believe that things will work out as they should providing we do what we should I think our tendency is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to so much of the time but we don't do the things that uh are necessary to make those things uh become reality uh I worked on this for some 14 years and I I think it helped me become a better teacher but it all revolved around that original definition of success you know uh a number of years ago there was a major league baseball umpire by the name of George moriarti and he spelled morard with only one eye that's that I'd never seen that before but he did and big league baseball players they're they're very perceptive about those things and they noticed he had only one eye in his name and you you'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had his head at various times but he wrote something that I think he did what I tried to do in this pyramid he called it the road ahead or the road behind and he said sometimes I think the fates must gr as we denounce them in insist the only reason we can't win is the fates themselves have missed yet there lives on the ancient claim we win or lose within ourselves The Shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow's game you and I know deeper down there's always a chance to win the crown but when we fail to give our best we simply haven't met the test of giving all and saving none until the game is really won of showing what is meant by grit of playing through another's quit of playing through not letting up it's bearing down that wins the cap of dreaming there's a goal INE of hoping when our dreams are dead of praying when our hopes have fled yet losing not afraid to fall if bravely we have given all for who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span giving all it seems to me is not so far from Victory and so the fates are seldom wrong no matter how they twist and wind it's you and I who make our Fates we open up or close the gates on the road ahead near the road behind reminds me of another set of Threes that my dad tried to get across to us no don't whine don't complain don't make excuses you get out there and whatever you're doing do it to the best your ability and no one can do more than that um I tried to get across to that my Parish don't tell you you never heard me mention winning never mention winning my idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game and you can win when you're outscored I've felt that way on certain occasions at various times and I I just wanted to be able to to be able to hold their head up after a game I used to say that when when a game is over and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome I hope they couldn't tell by your actions uh whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you um uh and that's what really matters if you make your effort to do the best you can regularly the results will be about what they should be not necessarily what you'd want them to be but they'll be about what they should but only you will know whether you can do that and that's what I wanted from them more than anything else and as time went by and I learned more about other things I I think it worked a little better uh as far as the results but I wanted the the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things and and not the end itself I believe it was a uh one great philosopher said no no cvan cvan said the journey is better than the in and and and I like that I I think that is it's getting there sometimes when you get there there almost a let down but it's getting there that's the fun I like as a basketball coach at usuca I liked our practices to be the journey and the the game would would be the end the end result I'd like to go up and sit in the stands and and watch the players play and see whether I'd done a decent job uh during the week I and there again it's getting the players to get that self-satisfaction AC knowing that they've made the effort to do the best of of of which uh they are capable um sometimes I ask who who was the best player I had over the best teams I I can never answer that as far as the individual are concerned I I like to I was asked one time about that I said suppose that you in some way could could could make the perfect player what would you want and I said well I'd want one that knew why he was at UCLA to get an education he was a good student really knew why he was there in the first place but I want one to play too I want one to realize that uh that defense usually wins championships and would work hard on defense and but I I'd want one to play offense too I want him to be unselfish and and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time and um I don't run that could pass and would pass I've had some that I've had some that could and wouldn't and I've had some that wouldn't could you couldn't so your child so I wanted that and I I wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside I want to be able to be good inside too i' want to be able to be able to rebound well at both ends too and why not just take someone like uh Keith wils and let it go at that he he had the qualifications and not the only one but he was one that I used in that particular category because I think he he made the effort to become the best of couple I mentioned in my book they call me coach that two players that gave me great satisfaction it came as closest I think anyone I ever had to reach their full potential one was Conrad Burke and one was Doug McIntosh when I saw them as freshman on our freshman team we didn't have freshman couldn't play Varsity when I I taught and um I thought oh gracious if these two players either one of them they were different years but I thought about each one of the time he was there who if he ever makes the bark at vars ours must be pretty miserable if he's good to make good enough to make it and you know one of them uh was a starting player for uh season and a half and the other was his next year he played the 32 minutes in national championship game did a tremendous for us and the next year he was a starting a starting player on National Championship team and here I I I thought he'd never play a minute when it was so those are the things that that give you great joy and great satisfaction to see one neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well but they had outstanding shooting percentages because they didn't didn't force it and neither one could jump very well but they get kept good position and so they did well rebounding they remembered that that every shot is taken they assumed it'd be missed I've had too men that stand around wait to see if it's missed then they go it's too late somebody else is in there ahead of them and and uh they weren't very quick but they played good position kept in good balance and and so they they pretty good defense for us so they had qualities that they came close to as close to reaching possibly their full potential as um any players I ever had so I consider them as to be as successful as a as a Lewis elender or a Bill Walton or and many of the others that we had there were some outstanding uh outstanding um players i' TR I rambled enough I I I was heard that when he makes his appearance I supposed to shut up [Applause] beauti"},

{"page": 74, "lesson": 12, "title": "National grid fully charged", "category": "Global Economics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/x9bcSF2s", "transcript": {"en": "on this week's fully charged I've come somewhere I really can't tell you about this episode of fully charged comes from National Grid control center which is somewhere in England I've come along here to find out more about the grid because the more I learn about things like renewable energy and electric vehicles the more the grid becomes the focal point of that discussion how is the grid gonna develop how is it going to be able to utilize new sources of power so I thought I come along here and ask some people who really know what they're talking about so we're in the National Grid switching room and I want to know what the National Grid is it's just loads of mile isn't it well here is the electricity national control center so from this room we control all the electricity generation and demand yeah that's what makes this room very unique right so in this room then you control where the electricity comes from yes how it gets to our houses exactly there's two functions here one is the transmission function where we look at the physical transmission network and the routing of power and then there's the energy side where we're controlling power stations output a monitoring demand and making sure that balance is exactly level because we have to manage this thing called system frequency right which is a function of the balance between generation and supply right so Nigel for the layperson I mean I can understand that bit because that's a map yes the overall amount we're generating the top is it that number what we're using below that and then the transfers is a plus and minuses of all the inputs and outputs from Netherlands France and on an island I see so somewhat we're sending some to North Island we're getting some from the Netherlands exactly on France the rest of the diagram here is as you see this is England Wales and Scotland on its side on its side so in England Wales the main transmission circuits of the blue 400 kV the red which is 275 kV and all the little yellow lines you're seeing there their circuits out of service so that's that's maintenance activity right we have three hundred and forty odd substations right now you see them all in the squares and they're having points there's nobody manned in the substation it's all controlled from here and then underneath is the generation makers is fascinating to watch those numbers yes and I change it day on day of course according to different tree big patterns and different prices what is the sort of peak of peak demand what's the most of you yeah well we have the peak of peak in February this year so our peak of peak is about 60 gigawatts 60,000 megawatts so today for example you can see on the wall here our demand at the moment is 42 94.9 right which is a typical summertime sort of plateau period so that so it isn't a flatline no no I wish it was like violent I mean I was amazed at how big the changes were yes and especially in the wintertime Sasori evening peak demand the demand comes on really hard when darkness coincides with the 5:30 time when people come home from work and you get a massive peak there and then it drops down in the evening right we've all heard about what happens when correlation street finishes or EastEnders finishes where people turn on their kettles and stuff we get big power surges but also ten years ago you had coal nuclear gas and the story really that was it was until now you've got a plethora of other in guess our world is changing massively and you can see today our wind is really down doctor if you pass me the oh yeah wind forecast we can see here the wind forecast is really picking up tomorrow we're gaining up to four and a half gigawatts of wind right which will cause us some operational problems here and depending on where that wind is then maybe there's some actions we have to take but we very carefully study that I will overlay the generation scenarios onto the transmission network I will flesh out any problems that we may see tomorrow I will take action accordingly so when that happens at the moment can you then reduce the call on carbon-based generating systems I mean can you tell yes we do all of it we do we do it in cost order so all the power stations submit as costs right in advance and then we'll cut we'll call off some of those costs in cost or the most expensive first in order to meet meet that balance but there are other issues as well for example integration with Europe is an issue so we're becoming more connected to Europe we're going to have more wind we can have more microgeneration and more solar and as far as we're concerned here it's all about data and forecast ability and the ability to model everything that may may not happen on the network do more analysis here to make sure that the transmission system is robust that we can transfer power both north-to-south which is predominantly the case today but but in the future the power flows are going to be south to north east to west just enough anyway which way yeah that's the big challenge for us I mean one of the obvious things we really need is a way of storing that and yes it's all it should be a massive thing for us especially overnight in Scotland for example but the demand dies away there's a surplus of renewable good cheap green generation on where the transmission system is unable to ship that power out yeah and we would otherwise have to curtail energy then a storage solution is just right just what we need as a country yeah but of course the scale we need it in is quite a challenge it's big and there's nothing of scale right to face the challenge we've got ahead so yeah one of the things and a lot of electric vehicle enthusiasts are very keen to point out is that they charge their cars at night and there's been an argument that because of big generators running and suddenly you've basically got to turn them off and if you didn't have to and you levelled out the demand over the whole day I mean is that an advantage is that a myth is that no no that's very very very true and right the flat the demand curve the more efficient the electricity supply and the cheaper for consumers right there's no doubt about that so in terms of the future of charging cars you know certainly overnight filling up the bathtub as some people call it is a good thing to do right because also that's the thing that electricity is used in the one big pump storage system we have which is in Wales and yes we have four of those actually I think it the biggest ones in Dinaric there's two in North Wales is two in Scotland as well so we create artificial demand if you like in the bathtub period when energy is cheap and we pump water up to the top reservoir for use when electricity is expensive and when the system needs it most right and that's a very instant that's kind of like a battery that you can sort of switch on in a way yes it's fantastic the guys love it here exists it's instantaneous power yeah yes so the next step then is how you develop the whole grid to deal with all those things I mean because that's I've heard this term used a lot the smart grid much good yeah a lot of people go what we need is a smart room ago I'm sure you're right but I don't know what it is yeah I mean what is a smart grid what we have to do here to cope with you know 30 gigawatts of wind for example which is meets the 2020 government target 30 gigawatts it's a huge increase we've got five gigawatts connecting today so to do that we love to do many many things to make the transmission network more robust and more flexible now there are many gadgets on the transmission network which have settings and we love to make sure those settings are optimized to operate the network with all my flexibility it needs we're gonna have to optimize throughput for example we know we can't build a way out of the problem we can do some build we want to do some build but we have to make sure that we maximize the use of the existing routes that we have right because the difficulties in getting power through from Scotland down through northern England and down south yeah we're deciding to put we call them bootstraps I decided I'm not over land this is in the sea subsea Y sub C that's point-to-point DC I mean why do we need a smart grid then I mean are there actual goals that were aiming to achieve in the next few years the electricity sector needs to have about 20 percent renewables on its network right by 2020 and what are we off is it's about a couple of percent involvement is really low at the moment the line share of renewables is going to come from wind it's a great volatile energy source is very different to call and gas and so we're gonna have to respond in a different way if you've got too much power coming and there's very low demand at night yes you can ring up a coal power power station and say turn it off or gas one but you can't stop a wind turbine temperature so can yes you can turn them down ask him to reduce output or or switch off how we do that when when we need to but it does cost us money and it seems to be a big thing for for the media when we do it but of course we've always turned down generation sources in cost order yeah that is part of the market that we have and we have had since the mid 90s right in the UK now we have 1,000 megawatts of solar right 1,000 megawatts on Germany has 20,000 yes so Germany are way ahead of us in terms of solar and as far as we're concerned solar and any other form of Michael generation is fine it's good green energy for us is just about data so we can overlay the generation sources onto the physical right transmission networks we can see the impact on flows and voltages and then we're going to be fine right it's where we don't have the data yeah is where we get into problems I think now after talking to I think the term smart grids bit cruel because it's not like you've got a stupid grid now it's pretty scarce got a smarter smarter grid is better yeah what would you say the kind of absolute key things that the National Grid needs to do to accommodate all that well one is on the assets themselves there's no substitute for why is in the sky network reinforcement getting more throughput through existing overhead lines be more sophisticated have more analytic tools and a visibility to model where all these energy sources are coming from and we can respond accordingly certainly from my point of view thing I'm very interested in is the impact of a lot of electric vehicles because I think now there's probably well there might be even 3,000 on the roads of the UK but I mean if that goes up to sort of hundreds of thousands or millions yes yeah what sort of impact do you think that will have some people say it will melt all the wires and the whole country right or halt we're forecasting about half a million vehicles electric vehicles on the road by 2020 and even with those numbers it's about a gigawatt in terms of old peak demand so the grand scheme of things that you can deal with that yeah so 2020 not a problem but we do foresee electric cars driving up demand past 2020 hopefully triggered by you know smart metering yeah hopefully that's gonna start filling in our bathtub right so it's gonna be good for us so now smart meters it tells you so much information about what you do and in effect you know you switch your kettle on you suddenly become aware where that electricity comes from how much it cost you do you think that will affect the way you operated do they interlink with you in any way oh it does very much so because we dispatch our generation on the basis of historic demand and that would demand today for example is forecast on the basis of what happened yesterday and smart metering slightly changes that paradigm so that people will respond and consume electricity in accordance with price signals and they will try to drive efficiency in their homes and I will tend to change the demand curves we might not be using less energy but we might be using more energy more efficiently yeah chief air unit effectively I mean it's not us exactly right people's habits electricity usage habits are very there's very heavy inertia and them right so yes I think it'll take a while even with smart metering to change for you hardly change yeah you know I like to with kids like to turn the whole house off just have a candle yes will it be nice I think it's fair to say then that we don't have a stupid grin at moment we've already got a smart grid but it's obviously going to get a lot smarter don't forget to join me again on fully charged"}, "multiple-choice": []}

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/chip-conley-measuring-what-makes-life-worthwhile", "transcript": {"en": "[Music] [Applause] and I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership in the 21st century in the 21st century we need to actually look at and what I'm going to actually encourage you to consider today is to go back to our school days when we learned how to count but I actually think it's time for us to think about what we count because what we actually count truly counts let me start by telling you a little story this is Van quash she came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam she changed her name to Vivien because she wanted to fit in here in America her first job was in an inner city motel in San Francisco as a maid I actually happened to buy that Motel about 3 months after Vivian started working there so Vivian and I have actually been working together for 23 years with the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old in 1987 I started my company and I called it ziv a very impractical name and uh because I actually was looking to create Joy of life and this first hotel that I bought Motel was a pay by the hour notel motel in the inner city of San Francisco as I spent time with Vivien I saw that she had sort of aat of Eve in how she did her work made me question and curious how could someone actually find joy in actually cleaning toilets for a living so I I spent time with Vivian and I saw that she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets her job her goal and her calling was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber what counts for Vivian was the emotional connection she created with her fellow employees and our guests and what gave her inspiration and meaning was the fact that actually she was taking care of people who are far away from home because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home that very human lesson more than 20 years ago served me well during the last uh economic downturn we had uh in the wake of theom Crash and 911 San Francisco Bay Area Hotels went through the largest percentage Revenue drop in the history of American hotels we were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area so we were particularly vulnerable but also back then remember we stopped eating french fries in this country well not exactly of course not um we actually started eating Freedom fries and we actually started boycotting anything that was French well my name of my company so I started getting these letters from places like Alabama and Orange County um saying to me that they were going to boycott my company because they thought we were a French company and I'd write them back and i' say wait a minute we're not French we're an American company we're based in San Francisco and I'd get a t response oh that's worse so one particular day when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of ziv I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices and I initially ended up in the business section the bookstore looking for a business solution but given my befuddled state of mind I ended up in the self-help section very quickly and that's where I got reacquainted with Abraham maso's hierarchy of needs I took one psychology class in college and I learned about this guy Abraham maslo as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs but as I sat there for 4 hours the full afternoon reading maslo I actually recognize something that is true of most leaders and one of the simplest facts in business is something that we often neglect and that is that we're all human and each of us no matter what our role is in business actually has some hierarchy of needs in the workplace so as I started reading more maslo what I actually started to realize is that actually maslo later in his life wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual and apply it to the collective to organizations and and specifically to business but unfortunately he died prematurely in 1970 and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely so I realized in that do crash that my role in life was to channel Abe maslo and that's what I did a few years ago when I actually took that five level hierarchy of needs pyramid and turn it into what I call the transformation pyramid which is survival success and transformation it's not just fundamental in business it's fundamental in life and we started actually asking ourselves the questions about how we were actually ing the higher needs these transformational needs for our key employees uh in the company these three levels of the hierarchy needs actually relate to the five levels of maso's hierarchy of needs but as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing the higher needs of our employees and our customers I realized we had no metrics we had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right so we actually started asking ourselves what kind of less obvious metrics could we use to actually evaluate our employees sense of meaning mean or our customer sense of emotional connection with us for example we actually started asking our employees do they understand the mission of our company and do they feel like they believe in it can they actually influence it and do they feel that their work actually has an an impact on it we start asking our customers did they feel an emotional connection with us in one of seven different kinds of ways miraculously as we ask these questions and start giving attention higher up the pyramid what we found is we created more loyalty our customer loyalty rocket our our employee turnover dropped to one3 of the industry average and during that 5year bust we tripled in size now as I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there and asking them how they were getting through that time what they told me over and over again was that they just manage what they can measure and what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid they didn't actually even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid so I started asking myself the question how can we get leaders to start valuing the intangent if we're taught As Leaders to just manage what we can measure and all we can measure is the tangible in life we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid so I actually went out and studied a bunch of things and I found a survey that showed that 94% of Business Leaders worldwide believe that the intangibles are important in their business things like intellectual property their corporate culture their brand loyalty and yet only 5% of those same leaders actually had a means of measuring the intangible in their business so as leaders we understand that intangibles are important but we don't have a clue actually how to measure them so here's another Einstein quote not everything that can be counted counts and not everything that counts can be counted I hate to argue with Einstein but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can't be counted or valued are we going to spend our lives just mired and measuring the mundane it was was that sort of heavy question about what counts that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week and fly off to the Himalayan Peaks fled off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries a place some folks called shangrala that's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid to becoming a transformation role role model for the world I went to Bhutan the teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man but this was back in 1972 when he ascended to the throne two days after his father passed away at age 17 he started asking the kind of questions that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's Mind on a Trip through India early in his reign as as king he actually was asked by an Indian journalist about the bhes GDP the size of the bhese GDP GDP and the King responded in a fashion that actually has transformed us four decades later he said the following he said why are we so obsessed and focused with gross domestic product why don't we care most about more about gross national happiness now in essence the King was asking us to consider an alternative definition of success what's what has come to be known as g& or gross national happiness most world leaders didn't take notice and those that did thought this was just Buddhist economics but the King was serious and this was a notable moment because this is the first time a world leader in almost 200 years had suggested that that in tangible of happiness again that that leader 200 years ago Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence 200 years later this King was suggesting that intangible of happiness is something we should measure and it's something that we should actually value as government officials for the next three decades next three three, years as king this King actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan and including just recently taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no Bloodshed no coup and Bhutan for those of you who don't know it is the newest democracy in the world just two day two years ago so as I spend time with leaders in the g& movement um I got to actually really understand what they were doing and I got to spend some time with the Prime Minister over dinner I asked him an impertinent question I asked him how can you how can you create and measure something which evaporates in other words happiness and he's a very wise man and he said listen bhutan's goal is not to create happiness we create the conditions for happiness to occur in other words we create a habitat of Happiness wow that's interesting and he said that they have a science behind that art and they've actually created four essential pillars nine key indicators and 72 different metrics that actually help them to actually measure their g& in fact one of those one of those key indicators is how do the Banes feel about how they spend their time each day it's a good question question how do you feel about how you spend your time each day time is one of the scarcest resources in the modern world and yet of course that little intangible piece of data doesn't factor into our GDP calculations so as I spent my week up in the Himalayas actually started to imagine what I call an emotional equation and it focuses on something I read long ago from a guy named Rabbi Heyman shakel how many know him anybody 1954 he wrote a book called the real enjoyment of living and he suggested that happiness is not about having what you want instead it's about wanting what you have or in other words I think the botines believe happiness equals wanting what you have imagine gratitude divided by having what you want gratification the botines aren't on some aspirational treadmill constantly focused on what they don't have uh their religion their isolation their deep respect for their culture and now the principles of their g& movement all have actually fostered a sense of gratit gratitude about what they do have how many of us here as tedsters in the audience spend more of our time in the bottom half of this equation in the denominator we're we are a bottom heavy culture in more ways than one um the reality is in western western countries quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness as if happiness is something that we have to go out an object we're supposed to or maybe many objects uh actually in fact if you look in the dictionary many dictionaries Define happy Define pursuit as to chase with hostility do we pursue happiness with hostility good question but back to Bhutan bhutan's actually bordered on its North and South by 38% of the world's population could this little country like a startup in a mature industry be the spark plug that actually influences a 21st century of middle class in China and India bhutan's actually created the ultimate export a new Global Currency of well-being and there are 40 countries around the world today that are actually studying their own g& you may have heard uh this last fall Nicholas sarosi in France announcing the results of an 18-month uh study by two Nobel economists focusing on happiness and wellness in France sarosi suggested that world leaders should stop myopically Focus fusing on GDP and consider a new index what some French are calling aiv index I like it co-branding opportunities and just three days ago three days ago here at Ted we actually had a simal cast of David Cameron potentially the next prime minister of the UK actually quoting one of my favorite speeches of all time Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968 when he suggested that we're myopically focused on the wrong thing and that GDP is a misplaced metric so it suggests that the momentum is Shifting I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote and actually turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here this is actually a collection of things that Robert Kennedy said in that quote GDP counts everything from air pollution to the destruction of our redwoods but it actually doesn't count the health of our children or the Integrity of our public officials as you look at these two columns here doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us to actually start figuring out a new way to count a new way to actually imagine uh what's important to us in life certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that he said GDP measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile wow so how do we do that well let me say one thing we could just start doing 10 years from now at least in this country why in the heck in America are we doing a census in 2010 we're spending 10 billion on a census and we're asking 10 simple question it is Simplicity but all of those questions are tangible they're about demographics they're about where you live how many people you live with and whether you own your home or not that's about it we're not asking meaningful metrics we're not asking important questions we're not asking anything that's intangible Abe maslo said long ago something you've heard before but you didn't realize it was him he said if the only tool you have is a hammer everything starts to look like a nail we've been fooled by our tool um excuse that expression um we've been fooled by our tool GDP has been our hammer and our nail has been a 19th and 20th Century industrial era model of success and yet 64% of the world's GDP today is in that intangible industry we call service the service industry the industry I'm in and only 36% is in the tangible industries of manufacturing and agriculture so maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox right maybe it's time we actually get a toolbox that doesn't just count what's easily counted the tangible in life but actually counts what we most value uh the things that are intangible I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad and I learned that economists measure everything in tangible units of production and consumption as if each of those tangible units is exactly the same they aren't the same in fact as Leaders what we need to learn is that we can actually influence the quality of that unit of production by actually creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling and in fact in Vivian's case her unit of production isn't the tangible hour she works it's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work this is Dave arringdale who's actually been a longtime guest at Vivian's Motel he stayed there a hundred times in the last 20 years years and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him they've created a habitat of happiness for Dave and he tells me that he can always count on viven and his staff and the staff there to make him feel at home why is it that Business Leaders and investors quite often don't see the connection between creating the intangible of employee happiness with creating the tangible of financial profits in their business we don't have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits we can have both and in fact inspired employees quite often help make sizable profits right so what the world needs now in my opinion is Business Leaders and political leaders who know what to count we count numbers we count on people what really counts is when we actually use our numbers to truly take into account our people I learned that from a maid in a motel and a king of a country what can you start counting today what one thing can you start counting today that actually would be meaningful in your life whether it's your work life or your business life thank you very much"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who is Vivian Quach?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The prime

But I've taken many forms during my life. I started out just like you: a tiny egg in a watery world. My parents never knew each other. One moonlit night before a storm, thousands of urchins, clams and corals released trillions of sperm and eggs\ninto the open sea. My father's sperm\nsomehow met my mother's egg, and they fused. Fertilization. Instantly, I became an embryo\nthe size of a speck of dust. After a few hours of drifting, I cleaved in two, then four, then eight cells. Then so many, I lost count. In less than a day, I developed a gut and a skeleton. I became a rocket ship, a pluteus larva. I floated through the world of plankton, searching for tiny algae to eat. For weeks, I was surrounded\nby all kinds of organisms, larvae of all sorts. Most are so different\nfrom their adult form that biologists have a tough time\nfiguring out who they are. Try matching these youngsters\nto their parents. This veliger larvae\nwill turn into a snail; this zoea, into a crab; and this planula, into a clytia jelly. Some of my young companions\nare easier to picture as grown-ups. These baby jellies, known as ephyrae, already resemble their beautiful\nbut deadly parents. Here in the plankton,\nthere's more than one way to get your genes\ninto the next generation. Most Medusa jellies make\nspecial structures called polyps, that simply bud off babies\nwith no need for sex. Salps are similar. When food is abundant, they just clone themselves\ninto long chains. The plankton is full of surprises\nwhen it comes to sex. Meet the hermaphrodites. These comb jellies and arrow worms produce, store and release\nboth sperm and eggs. They can fertilize themselves, or another. When you're floating in a vast sea, with little control over who you may meet, it can pay to play\nboth sides of the field. The majority of species here,\nhowever, never mate, nor form any sort of lasting bonds. That was my parents' strategy. There were so many of us pluteus larvae, I just hid in the crowd, while most of my kin were devoured. Not all parents leave\nthe survival of their offspring to chance. Some have far fewer young\nand take much better care of them, brooding their precious cargo\nfor days, even months. This speedy copepod totes her beautifully\npackaged eggs for days. This Phronima crustacean\ncarries her babies on her chest, then carefully places them\nin a gelatinous barrel. But the black-eyed squid takes the prize. She cradles her eggs\nin long arms for nine months, the same time it takes\nto gestate a human infant. Eventually, all youngsters\nhave to make it on their own in this drifting world. Some will spend\ntheir whole lives in the plankton, but others, like me, move on. A few weeks after I was conceived, I decided to settle down, and metamorphosed\ninto a recognizable urchin. So now you know a bit of my story. I may just be a slow-moving\nball of spines, but don't let my calm\nadult exterior fool you. I was a rocket ship.

and the Board of Overseers members of the faculty proud parents and above all graduates the first thing I would like to say is thank you not only has half had given me an extraordinary honor but the weeks of fear and nausea I have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight a win-win situation now all I have to do is take deep breaths squint at the red banners and convince myself than up that I am at the world's largest Gryffindor reunion delivering a commencement address is a great responsibility or so I thought until I cast my mind back to my own graduation the commencement speaker that day was the distinguished British philosopher Baroness Mary Warnock reflecting on her speech has helped me enormous Lee in writing this one because it turns out that I can't remember a single word she said this liberating discovery enables me to proceed without any fear that I might inadvertently influence you to abandon promising careers in business the law or politics for the giddy delights of becoming a gay wizard you see if all you remember in years to come is the gay wizard joke I've come out ahead of Baroness marijuana achieve Abul goals the first step to self-improvement actually I have wrapped my mind and heart for what I ought to say to you today I have asked myself what I wish I had known at my own graduation and what important lessons I have learnt in the 21 years that have expired between that day and this I have come up with two answers on this wonderful day when we are gathered together to celebrate your academic success I have decided to talk to you about the benefits of failure and as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called real life I want to extol the crucial importance of imagination these may seem pricks otic or paradoxical choices but bear with me looking back at the 21 year old that I was at graduation is a slightly uncomfortable experience for the 42 year old that she has become half my lifetime ago I was striking an uneasy balance between the ambition I had for myself and what those closest talk to me expected of me I was convinced that the only thing I wanted to do ever was write novels however my parents both of whom came from impoverished backgrounds and neither of whom had been to college took the view that my overactive imagination was an amusing personal quirk that would never pay a mortgage or secure a pension I know the irony strikes with the force of a cartoon anvil now so they hoped that I would take a vocational degree I wanted to study English literature a compromise was reached that in retrospect satisfied nobody and I went up to study Modern Languages hardly had my parents car round at the corner at the end of the road than I ditched German and scuttled off down the classics corridor I cannot remember telling my parents that I was studying classics they might well have found out for the first time on graduation day of all the subjects on this planet I think they would have been hard put to name one less useful and Greek mythology when it came to securing the keys to an executive bathroom now I would like to make it clear in parentheses that I do not blame my parents for their point of view there is an expiry date on blaming your parents for steering you in the wrong direction the moment you are old enough to take the wheel responsibility lies with you what is more I cannot criticize my parents for hoping that I would never experience poverty they had been poor themselves and I have since been poor and I quite agree with them that it is not an ennobling experience poverty entails fear and stress and sometimes depression it means a thousand petty humiliations and hardships climbing out of poverty by your own efforts that is something on which to pride yourself but poverty itself is romanticized only by fools what I feared most for myself at your age was not poverty but failure at your age in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at University where I had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories and far too little time at lectures I had a knack for passing examinations and that for years had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers now I am not done enough to suppose that because you are young gifted and well-educated you have never known heartbreak hardship or heartache talent and intelligence never yet inoculated anyone against the Caprice of the fates and I do not for a moment suppose that everyone here has enjoyed an existence of unruffled privilege and contentment however the fact that you are graduating from Harvard suggests that you are not very well acquainted with failure you might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success indeed your conception of failure might not be too far removed from the average person's idea of success so high have you already flown ultimately we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it so I think it fair to say that by any conventional measure a mere seven years after my graduation day I had failed on an epic scale an exceptionally short lived marriage had imploded and I was jobless a lone parent and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain without being homeless the fears that my parents had had for me and that I had had for myself had both come to pass and by every usual standard I was the biggest failure I knew now I'm not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun that period of my life is a dark one and I had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairytale resolution I had no idea then how far the tunnel extended and for a long time any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality so why do I talk about the benefits of failure simply because failure meant us stripping away of the inessential I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me had I really succeeded at anything else I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena where I believed I truly belonged I was set free because my greatest fear had been realized and I was still alive and I still had a daughter whom I adored and I had an old typewriter and a big idea and so rock-bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life you might never fail on the scale I did but some failure in life is inevitable it is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all in which case you fail by default failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way I discovered that I had a strong will and more discipline than I had suspected I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies the knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are ever after secure in your ability to survive you will never truly know yourself or the strength of your relationships until both have been tested by adversity such knowledge is a true gift for all that it is painfully one and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned so given a time Turner I would tell my twenty-one year old self that personal happiness lies in knowing that life is not a checklist of acquisition or achievement your qualifications your CV are not your life though you will meet many people of my age and older who confuse the two life is difficult and complicated and beyond anyone's total control and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicissitudes now you might think that I chose my second theme the importance of imagination because of the part it played in rebuilding my life but that is not wholly so though I personally will defend the value of bedtime stories to my last gasp I have learned to value imagination in a much broader sense imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity envision that which is not and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation in its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity it is the power that enables us to empathize with humans whose experiences we have never shared one of the greatest formative experiences of my life preceded Harry Potter though it informed much of what I subsequently wrote in those books this revelation came in the form of one of my earliest day jobs though I was sloping off to write stories during my lunch hours I paid the rent in my early twenties by working at the African research department of Amnesty International's headquarters in London there in my little office I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment to inform the outside world of what was happening to them I saw photographs of those who had disappeared without trace sent to amnesty by their desperate families and friends I read the testimony of torture victims and saw pictures of their injuries I opened handwritten eyewitness accounts of summary trials and executions of kidnappings and rapes many of my co-workers were ex political prisoners people who had been displaced from their homes or fled into exile because they had the temerity to speak against their governments visitors to our offices included those who had come to give information or to try and find out what had happened to those who had left behind I shall never forget the African torture victim a young man no older than I was at the time who had become mentally ill after all he had endured in his homeland he trembled uncontrollably as he spoke into a video camera about the brutality inflicted upon him he was a foot taller than I was and seemed as fragile as a child I was given the job of in scoring him back to the underground station afterwards and this man whose life had been shattered by cruelty took my hand with exquisite courtesy and wished me future happiness and as long as I live I shall remember walking along an empty corridor and suddenly hearing from behind a closed door a scream of pain and horror such as I have never heard since the door opened and the researcher poked out her out her head and told me to run and make a hot drink for the young man sitting with her she had just had to give him the news that in retaliation for his outspokenness against his country's regime his mother had been seized and executed every day of my working week in my early twenties I was reminded how incredibly fortunate I was to live in a country with a democratically elected government where legal representation and a public trial were the rights of everyone everyday I saw more evidence about the evils humankind would inflict on their fellow humans to gain or maintain power I began to have nightmares literal nightmares about some of the things I saw heard and read and yet I also learned more about human goodness at Amnesty International than I had ever known before amnesty mobilizes thousands of people who have never been tortured or imprisoned for their beliefs to act on behalf of those who have the power of human empathy leading to collective action saves lives and frees prisoners ordinary people whose personal well-being and security are assured join together in huge numbers to save people they do not know and will never meet my small participation in that process was one of the most humbling and inspiring experiences of my life unlike any other creature on this planet human beings can learn and understand without having experienced they can think themselves into other people's places of course this is a power like my brand of fictional magic that is morally neutral one might use such an ability to manipulate or control just as much as to understand or sympathise and many prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all they choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience never troubling to wonder how it would feel to have been born other than they are they can refuse to hear screams or peer inside cages they can close their minds and hearts to any suffering that does not touch them personally they can refuse to know I might be tempted to envy people who can live that way except that I do not think they have any fewer nightmares than I do choosing to live in narrow spaces leads to a form of mental Agra phobia and that brings its own terrors I think the willfully unimaginative see more monsters they are often more afraid what is more those who choose not to empathize enable real monsters for without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves we collude with it through our own apathy one of the many things I learned at the end of that classics corridor down which I ventured at the age of eighteen in search of something I could not then define was this written by the Greek author Plutarch what we achieve inwardly will change outer reality that is an astonishing statement and get proven a thousand times every day of our lives it expresses in part our inescapable connection with the outside world the fact that we touch other people's lives simply by existing but how much more are you Harvard graduates of 2008 lightly to touch other people's lives your intelligence your capacity for hard work the education you have earned and received give you unique unique status and unique responsibilities even your nationality sets you apart the great majority of you belong to the world's only remaining superpower the way you vote the way you live the way you protest the pressure you bring to bear on your government has an impact way beyond your borders that is your privilege and your burden if you choose to use your status and influence to raise your voice on behalf of those who have no voice if you choose to identify not only with the powerful but with the powerless if you retain the ability to imagine yourself into the lives of those who do not have your advantages then it will not only be your proud families who celebrate your existence but thousands and millions of people whose reality you have helped change we do not need magic to transform our world we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already we have the power to imagine better I'm nearly finished I have one last hope for you which is something that I already had at 21 the friends with whom i sat on graduation day have been my friends for life they are my children's godparents the people to whom I've been able to turn in times of real trouble people who have been kind enough not to sue me when I took their names for Death Eaters at our graduation we were bound by enormous affection by our shared experience of a time that could never come again and of course by the knowledge that we held certain photographic evidence that would be exceptionally valuable if any of us ran for prime minister so today I wish you nothing better and similar friendships and tomorrow I hope that even if you remember not a single word of mine you remember those of Seneca another of those old Romans I met when I fled down the classics corridor in retreat from from career ladders in search of ancient wisdom as is a tale so is life not how long it is but how good it is is what

A thorough understanding of biology requires a thorough understanding\nof the process of evolution. Most people are familiar\nwith the process of natural selection. However, this is just one\nof five processes that can result in evolution. Before we discuss\nall five of these processes, we should define evolution. Evolution is simply change\nin the gene pool over time. But what is a gene pool? And for that matter, what is a gene? Before spending any more time on genetics, let us begin with a story. Imagine that a boat capsizes, and 10 survivors\nswim to shore on a deserted island. They are never rescued, and they form a new population\nthat exists for thousands of years. Strangely enough,\nfive of the survivors have red hair. Red hair is created\nwhen a person inherits two copies of the red gene from their parents. If you only have one copy of the gene,\nyou won't have red hair. To make this easier, we will assume that the five non-redheads\nare not carriers of the gene. The initial frequency of the red-hair gene\nis therefore 50 percent, or 10 of 20 total genes. These genes are the gene pool. The 20 different genes\nare like cards in a deck that keep getting reshuffled\nwith each new generation. Sex is simply a reshuffling\nof the genetic deck. The cards are reshuffled\nand passed to the next generation; the deck remains the same, 50 percent red. The genes are reshuffled\nand passed to the next generation; the gene pool remains\nthe same, 50 percent red. Even though the population\nmay grow in size over time, the frequency should stay\nat about 50 percent. If this frequency ever varies,\nthen evolution has occurred. Evolution is simply change\nin the gene pool over time. Think about it in terms of the cards. If the frequency of the cards\nin the deck ever changes, evolution has occurred. There are five processes\nthat can cause the frequency to change. To remember these processes,\nwe will use the fingers on your hands, starting from the little finger\nand moving to the thumb. The little finger should remind you\nthat the population can shrink. If the population shrinks,\nthen chance can take over. For example, if only four\nindividuals survive an epidemic, then their genes will represent\nthe new gene pool. The next finger is the ring finger. This finger should remind you of mating,\nbecause a ring represents a couple. If individuals choose a mate\nbased on their appearance or location, the frequency may change. If redheaded individuals only mate\nwith redheaded individuals, they could eventually\nform a new population. If no one ever mates\nwith redheaded individuals, these genes could decrease. The next finger is the middle finger. The M in the middle finger should remind\nyou of the M in the word \"mutation.\" If a new gene is added through mutation,\nit can affect the frequency. Imagine a gene mutation\ncreates a new color of hair. This would obviously change\nthe frequency in the gene pool. The pointer finger\nshould remind you of movement. If new individuals\nflow into an area, or immigrate, the frequency will change. If individuals flow out\nof an area, or emigrate, then the frequency will change. In science, we refer to this\nmovement as gene flow. All four of the processes represented\nby our fingers can cause evolution. Small population size, non-random mating, mutations and gene flow. However, none of them lead to adaptation. Natural selection is the only process that creates organisms\nbetter adapted to their local environment. I use the thumb to remember this process. Nature votes thumbs up for adaptations\nthat will do well in their environment, and thumbs down to adaptations\nthat will do poorly. The genes for individuals\nthat are not adapted for their environment will gradually be replaced\nby those that are better adapted. Red hair is an example\nof one of these adaptations. Red hair is an advantage\nin the northern climates, because the fair skin\nallowed ancestors to absorb more light and synthesize more vitamin D. Thumbs up! However, this was a disadvantage\nin the more southern climates, where increased UV radiation\nled to cancer and decreased fertility. Thumbs down! Even the thumb itself is an adaptation formed through the process\nof natural selection. The evolution that we have described\nis referred to as microevolution, because it refers to a small change. However, this form of evolution may eventually lead\nto macroevolution, or speciation. Every organism on the planet shares\nancestry with a single common ancestor. All living organisms on the planet\nare connected back in time through the process of evolution. Take a look at your own hand. It's an engineering masterpiece that was created by the five\nprocesses I just described, over millions and millions of years. Can you recall the five main\ncauses of evolution from memory? If you can't, hit rewind\nand watch that part again. But if you can, give yourself or your neighbor\na big five-fingered high five."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Imagine a gene mutation creates a new color of hair.

{"page": 74, "lesson": 20, "title": "Insults by Shakespeare - April Gudenrath", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/insults-by-shakespeare", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Bedirhan Cinar Why do we cringe\nwhen we hear \"Shakespeare?\" If you ask me, it's usually\nbecause of his words. All those thines and thous and therefores and wherefore-art-thous\ncan be more than a little annoying. But you have to wonder,\nwhy is he so popular? Why have his plays been made and remade\nmore than any other playwright? It's because of his words. Back in the late 1500s and early 1600s, that was the best tool that a person had, and there was a lot to talk about. However, most of it was pretty depressing. You know, with the Black Plague and all. Shakespeare does use a lot of words. One of his most impressive accomplishments\nis his use of insults. They would unify the entire audience; and no matter where you sat, you could\nlaugh at what was going on onstage. Words, specifically dialogue\nin a drama setting, are used for many different reasons: to set the mood of the scene, to give some more atmosphere\nto the setting, and to develop relationships\nbetween characters. Insults do this\nin a very short and sharp way. Let's first go to \"Hamlet.\" Right before this dialogue, Polonius is the father of Ophelia,\nwho is in love with Prince Hamlet. King Claudius is trying to figure out\nwhy Prince Hamlet is acting so crazy since the king married\nPrince Hamlet's mother. Polonius offers to use his daughter\nto get information from Prince Hamlet. Then we go into Act II Scene 2. Polonius: \"Do you know me, my lord?\" Hamlet: \"Excellent well.\nYou're a fishmonger.\" Polonius: \"Not I, my lord.\" Hamlet: \"Then I would you\nwere so honest a man.\" Now, even if you did not know\nwhat \"fishmonger\" meant, you can use some contextual clues. One: Polonius reacted\nin a negative way, so it must be bad. Two: Fish smell bad, so it must be bad. And three: \"monger\"\njust doesn't sound like a good word. So from not even knowing the meaning, you're beginning to construct\nsome characterization of the relationship\nbetween Hamlet and Polonius, which was not good. But if you dig some more, \"fishmonger\"\nmeans a broker of some type, and in this setting,\nwould mean like a pimp, like Polonius is brokering out\nhis daughter for money, which he is doing for the king's favor. This allows you to see that Hamlet\nis not as crazy as he's claiming to be, and intensifies the animosity\nbetween these two characters. Want another example? \"Romeo and Juliet\" has some of the best\ninsults of any of Shakespeare's plays. It's a play about two gangs, and the star-crossed lovers\nthat take their own lives. Well, with any fisticuffs you know that there is\nsome serious smack talk going on. And you are not disappointed. In Act I Scene 1, right from the get-go we are shown the level\nof distrust and hatred the members of the two families,\nthe Capulets and Montagues, meet. Gregory: \"I will frown as I pass by,\nand let them take it as they list.\" Sampson: \"Nay, as they dare,\nI will bite my thumb at them, which is a disgrace\nto them, if they bear it.\" Enter Abraham and Balthasar. Abraham: \"Do you bite\nyour thumb at us, sir?\" Sampson: \"I do bite my thumb, sir.\" Abraham: \"Do you bite\nyour thumb at us, sir?\" Okay, so how does this development\nhelp us understand mood or character? Well, let's break it down to the insult. Biting your thumb today\nmay not seem like a big deal, but Sampson says it is an insult to them. If they take it so, it must have been one. This begins to show us\nthe level of animosity between even the men\nwho work for the two Houses. And you normally would not do\nanything to someone unless you wanted\nto provoke them into a fight, which is exactly what's about to happen. Looking deeper, biting your thumb\nin the time in which the play was written is like giving someone the finger today. A pretty strong feeling comes with that, so we now are beginning to feel\nthe tension in the scene. Later on in the scene, Tybalt,\nfrom the House of the Capulets, lays a good one on Benvolio\nfrom the House of the Montagues. Tybalt: \"What, art thou drawn\namong these heartless hinds? Turn thee, Benvolio,\nand look upon thy death.\" Benvolio: \"I do but keep the peace;\nput up thy sword, or manage it to part these men with me.\" Tybalt: \"What, drawn and talk of peace! I hate the word, as I hate hell,\nall Montagues, and thee. Have at thee, coward!\" Okay, heartless hinds. We know that once again,\nit's not a good thing. Both families hate each other,\nand this is just adding fuel to the fire. But just how bad is this stinger? A heartless hind is a coward, and calling someone that in front\nof his own men, and the rival family, means there's going to be a fight. Tybalt basically calls out Benvolio, and in order to keep his honor,\nBenvolio has to fight. This dialogue gives us a good look at the characterization\nbetween these two characters. Tybalt thinks that the Montagues\nare nothing but cowardly dogs, and has no respect for them. Once again, adding dramatic\ntension to the scene. Okay, now here's a spoiler alert. Tybalt's hotheadedness\nand severe hatred of the Montagues is what we literature people\ncall his hamartia, or what causes his downfall. Oh, yes. He goes down at the hands of Romeo. So when you're looking at Shakespeare,\nstop and look at the words, because they really are trying\nto tell you something."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "According to Gudenrath, what is one of Shakespeare's most impressive accomplishments?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "building the Globle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "his use of insults"}, {"label": "C", "text": "writing over 5,000 plays"}, {"label": "D", "text": "he learned 7 languages"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the purpose of dialogue in drama?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "set the mood"}, {"label": "B", "text": "create atmosphere"}, {"label": "C", "text": "develop relationships between characters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What does fishmonger mean in the context of Shakespeare's play Hamlet?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the captain of a fishing vessel"}, {"label": "B", "text": "like a pimp"}, {"label": "C", "text": "someone who looks and smells like a fish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a very poor, old man"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What happens in Romeo and Juliet that is akin to giving someone the finger?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the Capulets stuck out their tongues"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Samson bites his thumb"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the Montagues showed the back of their hands"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Abraham stuck his finger in his ear"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In the scene from Romeo and Juliet, what is heightened by the use of insults?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "dramatic tension"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the setting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the temperature"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the intense passion between the two famiilies"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

MIKE EVANS: Hi, I’m Dr.\nMike Evans and welcome to this visual lecture I’m calling,\n\"23 and a Half Hours\". So I have a big interest in\npreventive medicine, you know, which can mean\na lot of things from, you know, cancer screening,\nto eating more fibre, to having a good social\nnetwork and I -- I mean that in the old sense of the word. Weighing less, drinking less,\nsmoking less, controlling your blood\npressure, cholesterol, and so on and so forth. So all these things are\nincredibly important and I wouldn’t want you to\nminimize your efforts in any one category. But I -- I want to know\nwhat comes first. What has the biggest\nimpact, what has the biggest\nreturn on investment? [sound of cash register\nringing] What makes the biggest\ndifference to your health? So I did my research, and\nI found an answer, at least for me. And it's tricky ‘cause,\nyou know, all these things are sort of overlapping. But I picked out this\nintervention and -- because of its breadth. It worked for so many\ndifferent health problems, and that’s what I found\nso cool about it. So just to kind of walk\nyou through a quick list, so this intervention in\npatients with knee arthritis who received one hour of\ntreatment three times a week reduced their rates of pain and\ndisability by 47 per cent. In older patients it\nreduced progression to dementia and Alzheimer’s\nby around 50 per cent. For patients at high risk\nof diabetes and coupled with other lifestyle interventions,\nit reduced progression to Frank diabetes by 58 per cent. Post-menopausal woman who\nhad four hours a week of the treatment had a 41per\ncent reduction in the risk of hip fracture. It reduced anxiety by 48 per\ncent in a big meta-analysis. Patients suffering from\ndepression -- 30 per cent were relieved with low\ndose and that bumped to 47 per cent as we\nincreased the dose. Following over 10,000 Harvard\nAlumni for over 12 years, those that had the\nintervention had a 23 per cent lower risk of death than those\nwho didn’t get the treatment. It’s the number one treatment\nof fatigue, and, of course, the kind of outcome of\nchoice or my favourite outcome is quality of life, which is\nreally all of the above, and really about making\nyour life better. And this treatment has\nbeen shown over and over again to improve quality of life. So, the question is,\n\"What’s –- what’s the medicine?\" And what is \"23 and\na Half Hours\"? So the medicine was\nexercise, mostly walking. So not triathlons. And let me just put it\na different way. I think what I’m asking\nyou to do is if you think about your typical day, so\nthere's 24 hours, and so you might spend\nmost of your day, you know, this varies obviously, but,\nyou know, couch surfing, sitting at work, obviously\nsleeping, and what the evidence that I am going to show\nyou kind of tells me is the best thing you\ncan do for your health is to spend half an\nhour being active, maybe an hour and that if\nyou can do that you can realize all the benefits I’ve described\nin the previous slide. So let’s just take a quick walk\nthrough some of the literature. So Stephen Blair, he is a\nprofessor at the Arnold School of Public\nHealth at the University of South Carolina,\nand he looked at this in what’s called the Aerobic\nCentre Longitudinal Study which followed over 50,000\nmen and women over time. And along the left side of\nthis graph is something called Attributable Fractions\nwhich is a kind of fancy word, but it’s the estimate of\nthe number of deaths in a population that\nwould have been avoided if that specific\nrisk factor had been erased. So for example, turning a\nsmoker into a non-smoker, or a couch potato into\na daily walker. And along the bottom is\nthe typical risk factors. You can see the hypertension’s\nincredibly important, and so on and so forth. But the one that was most\n–- that kind of applied the most risk was this sort of\nmysterious CRF which is Cardio-Respiratory Fitness\nwhich is really low fitness. So low fitness was the\nstrongest predictor of death. And this is important. Most of the trails we see, to be\nhonest, are funded by Pharma, or other companies because\nthey’ve got a drug for hypertension or high\ncholesterol or diabetes. And we rarely see fitness\nthrown in to the mix. And so it’s nice to see a\ntrial that’s not so siloed. [sound of bicycle bell] Blair’s work is interesting. He also did another trial\nlooking at obesity. What he found was, you\nknow, sort of two things. One is obesity and no exercise –\nthat’s a very bad combination and that’s where we saw many\nof the negative consequences of obesity from a\nhealth point of view. But if the –- if the obese\nperson was active, even if they didn’t have\nthe weight loss, but were just active and\nobese, that was much, much better and that the\nexercise ameliorated much of the negative\nconsequences of obesity. So if exercise is the\nmedicine, what’s the dose? So when I think of dose,\nI think of how long, how often and how intense? I’m going to give you a\nslightly mixed message, but essentially, more\nactivity is better. But I must say the rate of\nreturn seems to decline after 20 or 30 minutes a\nday so if you’re being active less than 150 minutes a\nweek or more if you’re a kid -- an hour a\nday if you are a kid, my flag goes up in the clinic. So my personal take on\nthis is that, you know, the literature draws\na very broad brush and so we see big\ndifferences when somebody goes from not doing\nanything to doing something. And after that the return\nis more granular. So if we took the nurse’s health\nstudy, women who went from zero activity to just\none hour a week, reduced their heart disease\nrates by almost half. So you can break it down\nso it can be 10 minutes, 10 minutes, 10 minutes if\nyou want to do 30 minutes of exercise so it can be\nbroken into three. Higher intensity -- it\nlooks like it’s equivalent to less time with\nlower intensity. But I think obviously the\nclinical pearl is mostly of thinking about your style and\nhabits and your personal cues. So if you’re only going to\ndo it if it is pre-booked with friends, you know,\nI’ve couples who take a half hour walk every\nmorning or evening to organize their life. A dog is a great walking coach. [sound of dog barking] The data’s showing\n67 per cent of dog walkers achieve the 150 minutes a\nweek just with the dog walking. And finally, of course,\nyour commute. You know, getting off a\nstop early, taking the stairs, and so on and so forth. So thinking about that, I’m\njust going to walk you through some quick slices\nof the literature. And the first one\ncomes from Japan. In the 90s, Japan required\nall employers to conduct annual health screenings\nfor their employees. And so a large gas company\nin Japan called Osaka used this to answer\na great question. So if people’s walk to\nwork was longer, did that reduce their chance\nof serious health problems? So in this example,\nhigh blood pressure. And what they found is under 10\nminute walk, no difference; 11 to 20 minute walk,\n12 per cent reduction in rates of high blood\npressure or hypertension; and over 21 minute walk,\na 29 per cent decrease in rates of high blood pressure. So the authors calculated\nthat for every increase of 10 minutes in your walk to\nwork there was a 12 per cent reduction in the likelihood of\ngetting high blood pressure. The second exhibit is\nlooking at stents. So this is something we\ncommonly do now in medicine. So you can see on the left\nthat the artery is blocked; on the right, a vascular surgeon\nhas gone in and put a balloon, open it up and left\na stent to keep it open, which makes great sense. So a German researcher\nnamed Rainer Hambrecht looked at this with about\n100 cardiac patients. He got half the group to\nexercise and by that I mean 20 minutes a day on\nan exercise bicycle and then a once weekly 60\nminute aerobics class. And the other half got the\nhigh tech stent and just sort of normal activity. And after one year, 88 per\ncent of the exercisers were event-free compared\nto 70 per cent of the people that got a stent. So both worked, but I find it,\nyou know, sort of incredible that the low tech made a\nbigger difference. And you have to remember\nthat the stent just fixes one part of the heart. The next way to think\nabout it is the reverse, so what I call\n“sitting disease”. We know that being sedentary\nis bad for your health but a researcher\nnamed Leonard Veerman wanted to quantify this\nand he did so down in Australia in a big study\nthat he did there. They found comparative\npersons who watched no TV; those that spent a lifetime\naverage of six hours a day watching TV can expect to\nlive about five years less. I mean that’s incredible. But then I think, “Oh, who\nwatches 6 hours of TV?” It turns out the average\nadult in the USA spends about five hours a day\nwatching TV or screens. So I find this fascinating\nthat we never think of the TV as something that’s bad\nfor our health, but clearly it’s as powerful\nas many other risk factors for chronic disease. So I’m just going to\nleave you with, well, I guess, two quotes. So one is Jerry Garcia, the\nsinger who is the lead singer for The Grateful\nDead, and he said, “Somebody has to do something. It’s just incredibly pathetic\nthat it has to be us”. And I think that’s true, that\nin some ways it has to be us. As Hippocrates said, “Walking\nis man’s best medicine”. And so I’m going to finish\nby asking you a question. And this may have some\npersonal challenges for you, so you know, you\nmight be very busy with work or kids or both and\n-- or you may be in pain or have other priorities,\nbut my question to you is, “Can you limit your\nsitting and sleeping to just 23 and a half hours a day?” So, something to think about. Thank you very much. [sound of marker on white board]"}, "multiple-choice": []}

In the living world there's no landfill. Instead, \nmaterials flow. One species waste is another's   food. Energy is provided by the Sun. Things grow \nthen die and nutrients return to the soil safely. And it works. Yet, as humans, we've adopted a linear approach. We take, we make, and we dispose. A new \nphone comes out, so we ditch the old one, our washing machine packs up, so we buy another. Each time we do this, we're \neating into a finite supply   of resources and often producing toxic waste. It simply can't work long-term. So, what can? If we accept that the living \nworld's cyclical model works,   can we change our way of thinking, so \nthat we to operate a circular economy? Let's start with the biological cycle. How can \nour waste build capital rather than reduce it?   By rethinking and redesigning products and \ncomponents and the packaging they come in, we can create safe and compostable \nmaterials that help grow more stuff. As they say in the movies, no resources have \nbeen lost in the making of this material. So, what about the washing \nmachines, mobile phones, fridges? We know they don't biodegrade. Here, we're talking about another sort of rethink. A way to cycle valuable metals, polymers, \nand alloys so they maintain their quality and continue to be useful beyond the \nshelf life of individual products. What if the goods of today \nbecame the resources of tomorrow? It makes commercial sense. Instead of the throw away and \nreplace culture we become used to, we'd adopt a return and renew one, where products   and components are designed to \nbe disassembled and regenerated. One solution may be to rethink \nthe way we view ownership. What if we never actually owned our technologies, \nwe simply license them from the manufacturers? Now let's put these two cycles together. Imagine if we could design products to come \nback to their makers, their technical materials   being reused, and their biological parts \nincreasing agricultural value and imagine   that these products are made and transported \nusing renewable energy. Here we have a model   that builds prosperity long-term, and the \ngood news is there are already companies   out there who are beginning to adopt this \nway of working. But the circular economy   isn't about one manufacturer changing one \nproduct. It's about all the interconnecting   companies that form our infrastructure and \neconomy coming together. It's about energy,   it's about rethinking of the operating system \nitself. We have a fantastic opportunity to open   new perspectives and new horizons instead of \nremaining trapped in the frustrations of the   present with creativity and innovation, we \nreally can rethink and redesign our future."}, "multiple-choice": []}

"[Music] [Music] imagine if you could record your life everything you said everything you did available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips so you could go back and find memorable moments and relive them or sift through traces of time and discover patterns in your own life that previously had gone undiscovered well that's exactly the journey that my family began five and a half years ago this is my wife and collaborator rupal and on this day at this moment we walked into the house with their first child our beautiful baby boy and we walked into a house with a very special home video recording system this moment and thousands of other moments special for us were captured in our home because in every room in the house if you looked up you'd see a camera and a microphone and if you look down you get this bird's-eye view of the room here's our living room the baby bedroom kitchen dining room and the rest of the house and all of these fed into a disc array that was designed for a continuous capture so here we are flying through a day in our home as we move from sunlit morning through incandescent evening and finally lights out for the day over the course of three years we've recorded eight to ten hours a day amassing roughly a quarter million hours of multitrack audio and video so you're looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made and what this data represents for our family at a personal level the the impact has already been immense and we're still learning its value countless moments of unsolicited natural moments not posed moments are captured there and we're starting to learn how to discover them and find them but there's also a scientific reason that drove this project which was to use this kind of natural longitudinal data to understand the process of how a child learns language that child being my son and so with many privacy provisions put in place to protect everyone who's recorded in the data we made elements of the data available to my trusted research team at MIT so we could start teasing apart patterns in this massive data set trying to understand the influence of social environments on language acquisition so we're looking here at one of the first things we started to do this is my wife and I cooking breakfast in the kitchen and as we move through space and through time a very everyday pattern of life in the kitchen in order to convert this opaque 90 thousand hours of video into something we can start to see we use motion analysis to pull out as we move through space and through time what we call space-time worms and this has become a part of our toolkit for being able to look and see where the activities are in the data and with it trace the patterns of in particular where my son moved throughout the home so we could focus our transcription efforts all the speech environment around my son all the words that he heard for myself my wife our nanny and over time the words he began to produce so with that technology and that data and the ability to with machine assistants transcribe speech we've now transcribed well over seven million words of our home transcripts and with that let me take you now for a first tour into the data so you've all I'm sure see time-lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time I'd like you to now experience the blossoming of a speech form my son soon after his first birthday would say Gaga to mean water and over the course the next half year he slowly learned to approximate the proper adult form water so we're going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds no video here so you can focus on the sound the acoustics of a new kind of trajectory [Music] so he didn't just learn water over the course of the 24 months the first two years that we really focused on this is a map of every word he learned in chronological order and because we have full transcripts we've identified each of the 503 words that he learned to produce by his second birthday he was an early talker and so we started to analyze why why were certain words born before others this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us the way to interpret this apparently simple graph is on the vertical is an indication of how complex caregiver utterances are based on the length of utterances and the vertical axis is time and all of the data we aligned based on the following idea every time my son would learn a word we would trace back and look at all of the language he heard that contain that word and we would plot the relative length of the utterances and what we found was this curious phenomena that caregiver speech would systematically dip to a minimum making language as simple as possible and then slowly ascend back up in complexity and the amazing thing was that the that bounce that dip lined up almost precisely with when each word was born word after word systematically so it appears that all three primary caregivers myself my wife and our nanny were systematically and I would think subconsciously restructuring our language to meet him at the moment of the birth of a word and bring him gently into more complex language and the implications of this there are many but one I just want to point out is that there must be amazing feedback loops it's not of course my son is learning from his linguistic environment but the environment is learning from him that environment people are in these type feedback loops and creating a kind of scaffolding that has not been noticed until now but that's looking at the speech context what about the visual context we're now looking at think of this as a dollhouse cutaway of the of our we've taken those circular fisheye lens cameras and we've done some optical correction and then we can bring it into a three dimensional life so welcome to my home this is a moment one moment captured across multiple cameras the reason we did this is to create the ultimate memory machine where you can go back and interactively fly around and then breathe video life into this system what I'm going to do is give you an accelerated view of 30 minutes again of just life in the living room that's me and my son on the floor and there's video analytics that are tracking our movements my son is leaving red ink I'm leaving green ink we're now on the couch looking out through the window at cars passing by and finally my son playing in a walking toy by himself now we freeze the action 30 minutes we turn time into the vertical axis and we open up for a view of these interaction traces we've just left behind and we see these amazing structures these little knots of two colors of thread we call social hotspots the spiral thread we call a solo hotspot and we think that these affect the way language is learned what we'd like to do is start understanding the interaction between these patterns and the language that my son is exposed to to see if we can predict how the structure of when words are heard affects when they're learned so in other words the relationship between words and what they're about in the world so here's how we're approaching this in this video again my son is being traced out he's leaving red ink behind and there's our nanny by the door she offers water and off go the two worms over to the kitchen to get water and what we've done is used the word water to tag that moment that bit of activity and now we take the power of data and take every time my son ever heard the word water and the context he saw it in and we use it to penetrate through the video and find every activity trace that Co occurred with the instance of water and what this data leaves in its wake is a landscape we call these word scapes this is the word scape for the word water and you can see most of the action is in the kitchen that's where those big Peaks are over to the left and just for contrast we can do this with any word we can take the word by as a goodbye and we're now sumed in over the entrance to the house and we look and we find as you'd expect a contrast in the landscape where the word by occurs much more in a structured way so we're using these structures to start predicting the order of language acquisition and that's your ongoing worth now in my lab which we're peering into now at MIT this is at the Media Lab this has become my favorite way of video graphing just about any space three of the key people in this project Philip the camp Ronny cubot and Brendan Roy are pictured here Philip has been a close collaborator and all the visualizations you're seeing and Michael Fleischman was another PhD student in my lab who worked with me on this home video analysis and he made the following observation that just the way that we're analyzing how language connects to events which provide common ground for language that same idea we can take out of your home Deb and we can apply it to the world of public media and so our effort took an unexpected turn think of mass media as providing common ground and you have the recipe for taking this idea to a whole new place we've started analyzing television content using the same principles analyzing event structure of a TV signal episodes of shows commercials all of the components that make up the event structure we're now with satellite dishes pulling in and analyzing a good part of all the TV being watched in the United States and you don't have to now go an instrument living rooms with microphones to get people's conversations you just tuned in to publicly available social media feeds so we're pulling in about 3 billion comments a month and then the magic happens you have the event structure the common ground that the words are about coming out of the television feeds you've got the conversations that are about that those topics and through semantic analysis and this is actually real data you're looking at from our data our processing each yellow line is showing a link being made between a comment in the wild and a piece of event structure coming out of the television signal and the same idea now can be built up and we get this word scape except now words are not assembled in my living room instead the context the common ground the activities are the content on television that's driving the conversations and so what we're seeing here these skyscrapers now are commentary that are linked to content on television same concept but looking at communication dynamics in a different very different sphere so fundamentally rather than for example measuring content based on how many people are watching this gives us the basic data for looking at engagement properties of content and just like we can look at feedback cycles and dynamics in you know in a family we can now open up the same concepts and look at much larger groups of people this is a subset of data from our database just 50 thousand out of several million and the social graph that connects them through publicly available sources and if you put them on one plane a second plane is where the content lives so we have the programs and the the sporting events and the commercials and all of the link structures that tie them together make a Content graph and then the important that our dimension each of the links that you're seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content and there are again now tens of millions of these links that give us the connective tissue of social graphs and how they relate to content and we can now start to probe the structure in interesting ways so if we for example trace the path of one piece of content that drives someone to comment on it and then we follower that comment goes and look at the entire social graph that becomes activated and then trace back to see the relationship between that social graph and content very interesting structure becomes visible we call this a co-viewing clique a virtual living room if you will and there are fascinating dynamics at play it's not one-way a piece of content an event causes someone to talk they talk to other people that drives TuneIn behavior back into mass media and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior another example very different another actual person in our database and we're finding at least hundreds if not thousands of these we've given this person a name this is a pro amateur or pro a media critic who has this high fan out race a lot of people are following this person very influential and they have a propensity to talk about what's on TV so this person is a key link in connecting mass media and social media together one last example from this data sometimes it's actually the piece of content that is special so if we go and look at this piece of content President Obama's State of the Union address from just a few weeks ago and look at what we find in in the same data set at the same scale the engagement properties of this piece of content are truly remarkable a nation exploding in conversation in real time in response to what's on on the broadcast and of course through all of these lines are flowing unstructured language we can x-ray and get a real-time pulse of a nation real-time sand of the social reactions in the different circuits in the social graph being activated by content so to summarize the idea is this as our world becomes increasingly instrumented and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying in the context they're saying and what's emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynamics that have previously not been seen it's like building a microscope or telescope and revealing new structures about our own behavior around communication and I think the implications here are profound whether it's for science for commerce for government or perhaps most of all for us as individuals and so just to return to my son when I was preparing this talk he was looking over my shoulder and I showed him the clips I was gonna show to you today and I asked him for permission granted and and then I went on to reflect isn't it amazing this entire database all these recordings I'm gonna hand up to you and to your sister who arrived two years later and you guys are gonna be able to go back and re-experience moments that you could never with your biological memory possibly remember the way you can now and he was quiet for a moment I thought what am I thinking he's he's five years old he's not gonna understand this and just as I was having that thought he looked up at me and said so that when I grow up I can show this to my kids and I thought wow this is this is powerful stuff so I want to leave you with one last memorable moment from our family this is our the first time our son took more than two steps at once captured on film and I really want you to focus on something as I take you through it's a cluttered environment its natural life my mother's in the kitchen cooking and of all places in the hallway I realize he's about to do it about to take more than two steps and so you hear me encouraging him realizing what's happening and then the magic happens listen very carefully about three steps in he realizes something magic is happening and the most amazing feedback loop of all kicks in and he takes a breath in and he whispers Wow and instinctively I echo I echo back the same so let's fly back in time to that memorable moment nice walking [Music] [Applause] when I think about succeeding in business I think there's a couple of considerations first and foremost is teamwork today's problems are just too complicated to be solved as an individual and the opportunity to work with others collaboratively where you can build on each other's ideas I think is particularly important I think a second area that's quite important is the understanding of different disciplines it is critical that one be an expert in your major but it is absolutely essential that you have the ability to understand where other disciplines the input from other disciplines and be able to incorporate that to make effective decisions and then last but not least we are in a global business community and so the opportunity to understand cultures different cultures around the world to be able to incorporate some of the learning from those cultures and to incorporate that into your business decisions is essential to success I have three degrees from Cornell so I'd say just about everything that has prepared me came from Cornell and I am indebted to the University for that experience but as I think particularly about my business school career I think the exposure to a variety of disciplines the wealth of resources across the university we're exceptionally helpful"}, "multiple-choice":
