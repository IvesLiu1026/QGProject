{"page": 6, "lesson": 2, "title": "The archer's paradox in slow motion", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/L0ggycFd", "transcript": {"en": "Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So in one of the last episodes, I introduced you to a legend with a longbow. He's from my hometown and his name is Byron Ferguson. He shot an aspirin out of the air in slow-motion. But there's something that happened in the arrow I didn't understand. It was deflecting and it has something to do with what's called the \"archer's paradox\". What do you think, Byron? - \"The archer's paradox is the demon for all archers, but there are ways to work around it.\" Not bad! Alright, so today on Smarter Every Day, we're gonna understand how an arrow deflects and what's called the \"archer's paradox\". A paradox is a situation involving two things with a contradictory nature. So what is the archer's paradox? What are the two things an archer has to deconflict? My friend John explained it to me like this. Let's pretend that this pecan tree is the bow and this is the line of our bowstring. If we take an arrow and we put it into our bow and we draw the bow back, and we're trying to hit that target over there, watch what happens. As we release the bowstring and it travels closer to the bow - look at that -, the fact that the bow is sitting here in our way between us and the target, causes the arrow to point off in a different direction. So how can we possibly hit that target, when our arrow is pointed over there? This is the archer's paradox, because we know they actually do hit targets like that. Toy designers are cheaters: they don't deal with the paradox, they just get around it. For example, the guy who designed this suction cup bow, he doesn't go around the handle, straight through the middle. Check that out! Whoever designed this crossbow, instead of being in line with the bow itself, the string is offset by this big rail. That way, the string is always pushing along the dart. So how does a longbow shooter get around this problem? Here's how: they don't have a completely rigid arrow like that, they have a bendable arrow like this. See when it vibrates? You can see these nodal points? That's important. Check this out. As we put this real arrow into the bow here and we shoot, as we go towards the bow, the fact that we're accelerating this arrow causes it to build strain energy, causing this big curvature. That curvature then snaps back in the other direction once it bends to a certain point and look what we have. We have the arrow bending around the bow. When we release, it does something cool. It snakes around the bow, just like this and you're able to fly all the way to the target. So the archer's paradox is the fact that you have a bow in between you and the target and you're still able to get around the bow. \"The first that happens, is the arrow bends from the pressure of the string and the front arrow being against the riser of the bow. As it leaves the bow, or has already cleared the bow, it bends in the opposite direction. When those two cross, determines where the arrow will fly. One hundred percent of the time, the arrow will fly where these two points are crossed, are pointed. Whereas if this one had been here, then the arrow's gonna fly to the left. If it was here, the arrow flies off to the right. We want those two lined up to go straight to the target.\" - \"Gotcha. So the fact that it bends, helps it get around the arrow rest without going off in an angle, as if it were a straight line.\" - \"Correct.\" - \"You're pushing the string straight towards the handle, but somehow it makes it around the handle.\" - \"Right.\" - \"Yeah, and the bends is how it does that?\" - \"That's correct.\" Alright, my buddy Sander actually shoots with a compound bow. You don't do any of that longbow stuff, right? - \"I have one, but I'm not really good at it.\" - \"Alright, so what's the deal here?\" - \"So a compound, there's a whole lot more going on on a compound. There are more things that can go wrong, too, but there are several advantages if they're working.\" - \"Yeah.\" - \"So a compound, you see that's it cut out in the middle, you get this -\" - \"Oh, so the riser's not stout, is that what you're saying?\" - \"Yes, so the arrow is travelling straight, it doesn't have to go around a riser.\" - \"Okay.\" - \"And many people shoot also a drop-away rest, so it's gonna drop down. Whenever you pull the  bow back. a string attached to one of the bowstrings, pulls the rest up -\" - \"Nice!\" \"- centers your arrow, if you have it lined all up and square, your arrow is nice and level and then when you shoot, that arrow would dr- the rest would drop away -\" - \"Well, shoot it, shoot it. Let's do it. Oh no, wait, let me zoom in.\" \"Hold on, so I'm looking at that rest, it's gonna fall away, right? - \"Real fast!\" - \"Okay I'm ready. Dude, that is super fast. So is the arrow touching the rest as it goes through?\" - \"A little bit.\" - \"Really?\" - \"'Cause it drops but it's not, I mean, immediate, it's down before the arrow passes it.\" - \"So the goal here is, you don't have to bend around the riser, but I bet the arrow still bends, though?\" - \"It does bend and that's actually important in the straightness of the arrow flight.\" Isn't that interesting?But something else is going on here. Byron Ferguson is able to predict the wobbling of that arrow so good, that he's able to hit an aspirin tablet with a vibrating arrow, just like that. So one of two things is going on. Either a) he knows some science that we don't; or b) he's a warlock and this is all black magic. - \"Okay, the stiffness of an arrow is called the spine, right? And so the spine is what, Byron?\" - \"The stiffness of the arrow.\" - \"Oh, right! So this is your spine tester?\" - \"This is the spine tester, set up right now to test the flexion of a carbon arrow.\" - \"Okay.\" - \"So we actually have a two pound weight and the arrow's suspended at 26 inches. That's for carbon.\" - \"Okay.\" - \"And we read the inside of the scale here, to see how much it deflects.\" - \"So you, you test all of your arrows before you shoot, so that you can normalize the paradox?\" - \"Correct, I want all the arrows to have the same stiffness.\" - \"And that's how you're able to hit things like an aspirin?\" - \"That's part of it, yes.\" -\"There's a little bit of skill. If it's out of tolerance, you just don't even put it in your quiver?\" - \"That's what those are.\" - \"Really? Really? You've just a got a box of stuff that you don't shoot?\" - \"Yeah, they're too far out of tolerance.\" - \"Really? That's amazing. So, people were asking in the last video - that arrow was deflecting so much -, they're saying \"How do you time that?\" and the way you time that, is you know the exact spine of the arrow.\" - \"Correct.\" - \"That's awesome. This is pretty good information.So this isn't black magic, this is science?\" - \"Correct.\" - \"That's awesome.\" Byron is using science to normalize the wobble of his arrows. But less it been, there's a little bit of wizardry here, right? Because of the certain distance from his bow, he still has to know which side of the arrow that wobble's gonna be on. And then he has to line that up with an aspirin tablet. So this is a pretty good shot. In order to fully appreciate this trick shot, I'm gonna do a trick shot of my own, using the Phantom Miro.

{"page": 6, "lesson": 3, "title": "Why is blue so rare in nature?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/RbAukXY8", "transcript": {"en": "There are no blue tigers. No blue bats, no blue squirrels, or blue dogs. Even blue whales aren’t that blue. Animals come in pretty much every color, but\nblue seems to be the rarest. What’s cool, though, is when we do find\na blue animal, they’re awesome looking. Nature doesn’t do halfway with blue. To understand why this is, we’re gonna journey\nthrough evolution, chemistry, and some very cool physics. But, first we’re gonna need to understand\nwhy animals are any color at all, and to do that, we need to go look at some butterflies…\nbecause butterflies are awesome… and if you don’t think so, you’re wrong This is Bob Robbins. He’s curator of Lepidoptera at the National\nMuseum of Natural History in Washington D.C. Butterflies ARE awesome. Make no mistake about it. They’re a group of moths that evolved to\nbe active during the day, and if you’re active during the day, you have an advantage:\nYou can use light to communicate. You probably realize this, but out of all insects, butterflies display the brightest and most detailed patterns. And there’s a good reason for that: The colors in butterfly wings deliver messages,\nlike “I’m toxic”, or “I’m a male and this is my territory”, but not all butterfly\ncolors are created equal. If we zoom way in on a butterfly wing, we\nsee the colors come from tiny scales. It’s actually how moths and butterflies\nget their scientific name. Oranges, reds, yellows browns…those scales\nall contain pigments, organic molecules that absorb every color except what we see. Black scales absorb all colors. Animals, from butterflies to birds to you\nand me, don’t make these pigments from scratch, they’re made from ingredients in our diet. You might know this thanks to flamingos: They’re\nborn gray, but turn pink thanks to pigments called carotenoids in crustaceans they eat. So when it comes to these colors: You are\nwhat you eat. But not so for blue. Blue is *different* If you move the camera, you can see that the\ncolor changes as you move the camera. It does. It’s like a hologram thing. This is because there’s no blue pigment\nin these butterflies Wait… so they’re blue, but they’re not\nreally blue? That’s correct! Yes. You’re lying to me butterflies! These are Blue Morpho butterflies, maybe the prettiest butterflies of all. I mean… they did make it the butterfly emoji. The blue color isn’t from a pigment. The blue comes from the shape of the wing\nscale itself, and when I learned how this works, it kinda blew my mind. If we zoom way in on a blue wing scale, we\nsee these little ridges. If we slice across the scale, and look closer,\nwe see those ridges are shaped like tiny Christmas trees. The arrangement of the branches is what gives\nMorpho wings their blue color. When light comes in, some bounces off the\ntop surface. But some light passes into the layer and reflects\noff the bottom surface. For most colors of light, waves reflecting\nfrom the top and bottom will be out of phase, they’ll be canceled out, and that light\nis removed. But blue light has just the right wavelength:\nthe reflected light waves are in sync, and that color makes it to our eye. This hall of mirrors only lets blue light\nescape. There’s even a pigment at the base that\nabsorbs stray red and green light to make the blue even more pure. That’s how we get this awesome iridescent\nblue. The microscopic structure of the wing itself. All of this happens because of the way light\nbends when it moves from air into another material. So if we fill all those tiny gaps with something\nother than air, like alcohol, the blue disappears. Technically, this “changes the index of\nrefraction”, but in plain English that means blue light is no longer bent the right way. The microscopic light filter is broken. Until the alcohol evaporates. And the color returns. But these butterflies live in the rainforest. You think they’d lose their color any time\nthey got wet, right? Well watch this. These wing scales are made of a material that’s\nnaturally water-resistant. What about this blue jay feather? If we look through it, the color completely\ndisappears. No blue pigment. Each feather bristle contains light-scattering\nmicroscopic beads, spaced so everything but blue light is canceled out. Unlike the highly-ordered structures we find\nin butterfly wings, these feather structures are more messy, like a foam, so instead of\nchanging as we move, the color’s more even from every direction. Peacock tail feathers? Again it’s the shape of the feather, not\npigment. But the light reflecting structures here are\nmore ordered, like a crystal, so it’s brighter from certain angles. There’s even a monkey–WHOA let’s keep\nthis PG!!–even that color is made by the adding and subtracting of light waves thanks\nto structures in the skin… not pigment. And yes, even your blue eyes, are colored\nby structures, not pigments. Outside of the ocean, almost exclusively,\nthe bluest living things make their colors with microscopic structures, and each one’s\na little different. No vertebrate, not a single bird or mammal\nor reptile that we know of, makes a blue pigment on its body. In fact, there’s only one known butterfly\nthat has cracked the code for making a true blue pigment. Blue as a pigment in nature is incredibly\nrare. But there’s one exception so far that we\nknow about, and these are over here called the olivewings. They have evolved a blue pigment. They’re not very common and we don’t know\nmuch about them, and I don’t know of any other blue pigment. That’s a really special butterfly. Why is almost all of nature’s blue made\nfrom structures and not pigments like everything else? I’ve asked this question to several scientists\nthat study color, and here’s their best theory so far: At some point way back in time,\nbirds and butterflies evolved the ability to see blue light. But they hadn’t yet evolved a way to paint\ntheir bodies that color. But if they could, it’d be like going from\nearly Beatles to Sgt. Pepper’s Beatles. it meant new opportunities for communicating\nand survival. Creating some blue pigment–out of the blue–would\nhave required inventing new chemistry, and there was no way to just add that recipe to\ntheir genes. It was much easier for evolution to change\nthe shape of their bodies, ever so slightly, at the most microscopic level, and create\nblue using physics instead. They solved a biology problem with engineering. What I love about this is these colors have\nfascinated curious people for hundreds of years. After looking at peacock feathers through\none of the first microscopes back in the 1600’s Robert Hooke wrote:\n“these colours are onely fantastical ones” Even Isaac Newton noticed there was something\nunusual about these blues, and scientists have been studying it ever since. Not only because the science is interesting,\nbut because it’s beautiful.

{"page": 6, "lesson": 4, "title": "What if all the ice melted on Earth?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/YtYb80OT", "transcript": {"en": "you've likely heard about the effects that climate change is having on our planet and specifically in the Arctic which is warming twice as fast but what would actually happen if all the ice melted on Earth I can help with that when you and I drink water we drink nons salty water we drink fresh water now of all the water in the world most of it is salty just 3% is not salty now of that 3% you can't get to most of that because 70% of that 3% is Frozen 30 million cubic kilomet of Frozen water it's so much frozen water so much ice that if you had a layer of it 1,000 M thick it would cover North America that's a lot of Frozen water people on land frozen water forms glaciers ice sheets Perma frost and snow but the Arctic is largely ocean so there it takes the form of floating sea ice like icebergs and because it's in direct contact with warming Waters sea ice will be the the first to melt as global temperatures rise in fact this year NASA reported that the extent of Arctic sea ice was the lowest ever recorded for January February April May and June 2016 so the world is getting warmer and the ice is melting pretty soon you'll be able to drive your ship from Europe to Russia right over the North Pole with no ice in the way that that's good for certain shipping companies maybe but for the marine species the polar bears the walruses the seals they don't have their old habitats they're all going away they're melting out from under them and ocean dwelling animals like boohead whales and narwhals aren't immune to these changes either as sea ice melts energy and oil companies are taking it as an opportunity to search further north for untapped resources using a process known as seismic blasting they shoot air explosions into the water in an effort to map the ocean floor and find oil of course this has detrimental effects on the whole ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean while also causing physical trauma and habitat relocation in whales in terms of sea levels melting sea ice won't have much of an effect this is because the floating ice already displaces roughly the same amount of water as it would produce when it melts so the net effect would be negligible furthermore the majority of Earth's ice more than 95% is landbased and contained mostly in enormous ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica where there are entire mountain ranges almost as big as the Alps completely buried in ice so what if all the ice on land melts if all this ice melts the ocean's going to have more water in it so the sea levels as measured from the coasts is going to go up it's going to go up 70 M that's a long way people half the world citizens live on sea coasts that's where the uh Commerce action is so they're going to have to move where are they going to go and who's going to pay for it Tokyo New York South par APO Mumbai Shanghai and Jakarta are all Coastal and happen to be some of the world's biggest cities even a small sea level rise of only a couple feet could cause up to a trillion dollar worth of flood damage per year a rise of 10 m would displace more than 630 million people nearly 10% of the world's population at 25 M 1.4 billion people roughly 20% of humanity is left homeless and to visualize the full 70 M the rising Seas would drown out most of the US Eastern Seaboard much of the West Coast the entire State of Florida huge areas of Asia including Bangladesh and much of northern China and create a new Inland Sea in Australia at the North and South Pole of the earth we have a lot of ice ice is White Ice reflects sunlight into space but there's a feedback mechanism one thing leading to another as the world gets warmer the ice melts as the ice melts it's reflecting less sunlight into space which lets the world get warmer still the sunlight is absorbed by the dark liquid ocean so as the ice melts the world gets warmer and the Sea gets fresher currently the world's oceans are crisscrossed by a set of currents that act like a giant conveyor belt and these currents are powered in part by the differences in the saltiness between one part of the ocean and another so if a melting II in Greenland dumps a whole bunch of non-s salty freshwater into the North Atlantic it's possible that it could disrupt the currents so the conveyor belt takes chemicals takes nutrients around the world which feed Plankton which feed fish which Feed Us half of the oxygen you breathe is made by plants in the ocean so you don't want to mess with this furthermore as that sea surface gets warmer off of Greenland the Gulf Stream will probably shift a little bit and if that shifts what keeps Europe warm right now may not keep Europe as warm so the crops are going to have to be grown grown elsewhere and who's going to grow them and who's going to ship them around and who's going to feed each other and what's going on this is serious business when you go melting the ice we actually went up to the Arctic to see the current state of things firsthand while documenting it all and were absolutely shocked by what we found click here to watch our documentary the end of the Arctic where we learn about an Inuit community's fight to defend their human rights

I know you’re probably thinking based off\nthe title, how is Life Noggin gonna make a video on memes? Well buckle up, because while I don’t understand\na lot of memes I look at, I do understand why we share these funny little artifacts\nof society. Most of you probably know what a meme is but\nfor those of you who don’t know, a meme is a cultural item often found in the form\nof an image, video, or something similar that is typically altered and spread through the\nworld. While the internet has increased the rate\nat which memes are produced, you can find examples of memes well before our digital\nage such as Killroy was here, That little “S” drawing everyone did on their textbooks\nand even Darth Vader’s line “I am Father” It seems that there are a few different reasons\nas to why we love sharing memes with one another. In a comprehensive, three-phase study by the\nNew York Times, researchers looked into the psychology of why people share things online. They found five primary motivations; to bring\nenlightening and entertaining content into the lives of the people we care about, to\ndefine ourselves, to grow and nurture our relationships, for self-fulfillment, and to\nspread the word for causes we believe in. Some or all of these motivations might be\nwhat’s driving us to keep on sharing various lowres images with ridiculous captions. Sharing a screenshot of a cartoon character\nwith a funny but relatable caption might seem nonsensical and sometimes it is but you’re\nactually expressing yourself and other people who see it feel connected to a shared experience. More than just being good for a giggle, spending\ntime on social media and looking at memes might help to make you a better person! In a recent psychological study, researchers\nfound that spending more time on social networks and engaging in instant message chats predicted\nmore ability to have virtual empathy. Going beyond our brightly lit screens, being\nbetter at dispensing virtual empathy was the best indicated predictor in the study at being\nable to express /real-world/ empathy. Furthering the benefits of our social media\nand meme obsession, another study found that posting on a social media sites can help to\ndecrease feelings of loneliness. When the participants of the study were experimentally\ninduced to increase their status update activity, their loneliness was found to be reduced. This decrease in loneliness was due to the\nparticipants feeling more connected to their friends on a daily basis. You're not just sharing a photo of a confused\nface, you're letting your friends or random people on the internet know that they aren’t\nalone in their feelings. That being said, some studies and researchers\nseem to come to the conclusion that too much time on social media, looking at memes and\noversharing might have the opposite effect, making you feel more lonely and disconnected. It’s best to take breaks from social media\nand sharing things so you don’t overload yourself. And that’s coming from me! Did you know that Life Noggin is on twitter,\ninstagram and facebook!?

Because not everyone has that kind of internal\nmonologue—or, what psychologists often  refer to as inner speech. And even people who do hear their thoughts\ndon’t necessarily talk in their heads 247. It turns out that inner speech could tell\nus a lot about how our brains work, how they develop, and how we speak. But… research on all this is really just\ngetting started. Inner speech is somewhat loosely defined as\nwhen a person “speaks” meaningful thoughts without producing sound or moving any part\nof their body, like their tongue or their lips. Though, in some ways, it’s easier to define\nby what it isn’t. It’s different from visualizing or picturing\nthings in your head. And it doesn’t include feelings like happiness\nor hunger, or your awareness of sensory experiences, like noticing the glint of something shiny\non the ground. So basically, it only refers to thoughts accompanied\nby specific words. These words usually have the same tone, inflection,\nand even accent that they would if were spoken aloud—though not always, which we’ll get\nto in a bit. Even figuring that much out about inner speech\nwas somewhat of a challenge for psychologists, because—surprise!—it’s really hard to\nmeasure people’s internal experiences. So there’s been a lot of variation in research\nmethods, and not a lot of agreement between different studies and different scientists. For example, some studies have tried to see\ninside people’s heads by prompting them to hear specific words or phrases in their\nmind—like, by asking them to read something silently or determine if two words rhyme without\nsaying them out loud. That’s revealed some weird quirks about\ninner speech—like that, when people read, they’re actually much more likely to mentally\nsay single words that represent a passage than every word of every sentence. But prompted inner speech and spontaneous\ninner speech aren’t really the same. Plus, prompts can't tell us much about how\nfrequently or why people use inner speech in their daily life. So, some researchers use questionnaires instead. According to those, these conversations we\nhave with ourselves are generally about... ourselves. And kind of in a bad way. Most of the time, our inner speech consists\nof negative things about ourselves, our negative emotions, or us trying to decide if we’re\ngood enough. And, weirdly enough, that’s all usually\nin full sentences. Only about one-third of people experience\nabbreviated inner speech, where a single word or phrase represents an entire complex thought. So… the opposite of what happens when we\nread. Questionnaires have also tried to get at the\nquestion of how often people engage in inner speech, but they have a few limitations. Perhaps the most glaring is that people generally\naren’t great at being aware of their inner experiences, so questionnaires probably overestimate\nthe frequency of inner speech. More recently, researchers have started using\na procedure called Descriptive Experience Sampling, or DES instead. With DES, people carry a beeper that goes\noff randomly throughout the day. And when it does, they write down some notes\nabout exactly what was going on in their  head at that moment. It’s like when you’re sitting across from\nyour friend and you’re like “what ya thinking about?” It’s not perfect. Some researchers think that DES goes too far\nand underestimates inner speech, for example. But it is giving scientists a better sense\nof how many people “hear” their thoughts and how often. And it’s revealed that inner monologues—like\nmost things in psychology—are on a spectrum. Very few people have no inner speech at all,\nand very few people engage in it one hundred percent of the time. DES studies suggest that seventy to eighty-five\npercent of people experience some kind of spontaneous inner speech at least occasionally. And of those people, most of them are talking\nto themselves about fifteen to thirty percent of the time. It’s also possible to have more than one\ninternal experience simultaneously, so you might be visualizing something and talking\nto yourself about it. And inner speech varies in other ways, too. While a lot of people talk about this in terms\nof internal monologues, about seventy-five percent of people report that sometimes they’re\nhaving back-and-forths in their head. They usually play both parts in the conversation,\nthough—only about twenty-five percent of people report that other people show up in\ntheir inner speech. People who have ever had an imaginary friend\nare more likely to use this kind of dialogic speech, even if they don’t have that friend\nanymore. Which is pretty cute. Others might experience something a little\ndifferent but similar: what psychologists call imagined interactions. Basically, that’s when you imagine all the\nthings you should have said to that guy who stole your parking spot, or rehearse what\nyou’re going to say to your date later. What’s not clear in all of this is why people\nhave different inner monologues or dialogues, and what those differences say about them. We don’t even really know where inner speech\ncomes from. From an evolutionary standpoint, many experts\nthink that inner speech came about as part of the process for generating overt speech. It may even be a side effect of sorts of spoken\nlanguage that’s been co-opted for other cognitive tasks. See, when you go to speak, your brain simultaneously\nsends signals to two different areas: one to motor parts of the brain to control the\nmouth and the tongue and stuff, and a copy to the sensory parts of the brain. The sensory signal allows the brain to make\na prediction about what it’s about to hear. Essentially, you recite words in your head\nas you say them out loud. And it turns out that same kind of signal\noccurs during inner speech. That may be why you can quote “hear” yourself—you’re\nliterally activating the hearing part of your brain. And some psychologists think this means the\nunderlying purpose of internal speech is to catch errors when you talk. If the internal prediction matches what you\nsay, your brain knows it can filter your words out of what it’s hearing and focus on the\nrest of the sounds coming in. If they don’t match—like if you stumble\nover a word—your brain lets you know that you made a mistake so that you can stop and\ncorrect yourself. But it doesn’t seem like this error correction\nis absolutely essential for speech, because the two can be separated from one another. There are cases of people with brain damage\nwho lose their inner speech but not the ability to talk, and vice versa. Still, inner speech could have helped people\ncommunicate better, which could explain why it evolved. This is just the prevailing hypothesis, though,\nand it’s possible it’s wrong. Also, it’s likely that even if inner speech\nstarted this way, the brain has repurposed it for other uses. Those other uses might explain why it differs\nbetween people. Some psychologists think our everyday inner\nspeech reflects conversations that we had out loud as kids—especially moments when\nour caregivers talked us through solving a problem or calmed us down. The idea is that these teaching moments get\ninternalized as we grow up, and then we essentially replay them in our heads later—which would\nexplain why inner speech often resembles  a conversation. And, this could explain why, content-wise,\nit’s often about self-regulation—things like problem-solving, planning things out,\ntime management, and motivation. Those are all things someone would help talk\ntheir young child through. Plus, the same brain areas are activated during\ninternal dialogic speech and when a person is thinking about someone else’s experience\nand perspective. That would make sense if the voice in your\nhead is basically your brain recycling someone else’s words. So, if this theory is correct, inner speech\nmight be different between people simply because their upbringings and social interactions\nwere different. We still don’t know how or if those differences\nmatter, mind you. But there are some big clues that inner speech\nplays an important role in cognition—so, all those brain processes involved in thinking. For instance, scientists have used a test\ncalled a dual-task paradigm to see how inner speech affects problem solving. Basically, they ask the person to solve a\nproblem while doing something else. And if that second task is physical—like,\ntapping their foot—they generally have no problem with it. But if it’s verbal—like, remembering a\nlist of words—then they perform worse. Researchers think that’s because those words\ndisrupt their inner speech, making it so they can’t really talk themselves through the\nproblem. Inner speech may also be an important tool\nfor memory, and more specifically, working memory. That’s the memory where you store the information\nyou want to access really quickly. One of the components in working memory is\nthe ability to repeat information to yourself until you no longer need it—and for that,\nyou need inner speech. In fact, people who do more self-managing\ninner speech—so, things like talking themselves through solving a problem—do seem to do\nbetter on some cognitive tasks. So differences in how people talk to themselves\nmight underlie differences in how well they perform different kinds of thinking. Inner speech may also play a part in mental\nhealth conditions. Research has connected it to depression and\nanxiety, for example. People who have more depressive tendencies\ntend to experience more depressive self-talk. And we know that people who are more anxious\ntend to engage in more self-critical inner speech. It’s not clear if these negative forms of\ninner speech exacerbate or even cause those conditions, or if the conditions lead to higher\namounts of negative inner speech. Though, studies have found that if you ask\npeople to think verbally about hypothetical situations—even positive ones—their mood\nis lower than if you ask them to picture the hypothetical situations instead. And that does support the idea that the speech\npart of inner speech might make people less happy… for some reason. Other research has tied inner speech to symptoms\ncommon in psychotic disorders. For example, people with schizophrenia often\nreport hearing voices of people speaking to them or telling them what to do. One theory is that those “voices” are\nactually inner speech. Remember that prediction signal I mentioned\nearlier? Well, some experts think that if something\nin that neural circuit is off, then the brain’s usual way of identifying self-made sounds\nand thoughts could be off, too. So basically, that person’s brain might\nnot be so great at separating sounds they generate from ones they hear. And that may mean it also attributes inner\nspeech to someone else. Because of these potentially important roles\nin cognition and mental health, psychologists are eager to gain a better understanding of\nwhat inner speech is and why it happens. And figuring all that out could tell us a\nlot about, well, a lot—from how our brains develop and work to what’s actually happening\nin a variety of mental disorders. But as of right now, we just don’t know\nthat much about this thing most of us do every day. There are a lot of big questions currently\nunanswered, like where inner speech comes from, why it differs between people, and what\nthose differences mean. Like, can you change your inner monologue? Can you train yourself to think in conversations,\nor to hear other voices or your own more often? We don’t even know if you should want to\nmake those changes—if there are the benefits or downsides of different kinds of inner speech. And it’s probably going to be a while before\nwe have any clear answers, because our methods for studying it just aren’t great, and there’s\na lot of debate over basic questions, like how many people even do it in the first place. In the meantime, though, you can still talk\nabout it amongst yourself. Thanks to Eric for asking us about this topic,\nand to all our other patrons who support us on Patreon.

But there was just one small problem: I had absolutely no talent. So I decided to set\na world record in something that demanded absolutely no skill at all. I decided to set a world record in crawling. (Laughter) Now, the record at the time\nwas 12 and a half miles, and for some reason,\nthis seemed totally manageable. (Laughter) I recruited my friend Anne, and together we decided,\nwe didn't even need to train. (Laughter) And on the day of our record attempt, we put furniture pads\non the outside of our good luck jeans and we set off, and right away, we were in trouble, because the denim was against our skin and it began to chafe, and soon our knees were being chewed up. Hours in, it began to rain. Then, Anne dropped out. Then, it got dark. Now, by now, my knees\nwere bleeding through my jeans, and I was hallucinating from the cold and the pain and the monotony. And to give you an idea\nof the suffer-fest that I was undergoing, the first lap around\nthe high school track took 10 minutes. The last lap took almost 30. After 12 hours of crawling, I stopped, and I had gone eight and a half miles. So I was short of\nthe 12-and-a-half-mile record. Now, for many years, I thought\nthis was a story of abject failure, but today I see it differently, because when I was\nattempting the world record, I was doing three things. I was getting outside my comfort zone, I was calling upon my resilience, and I was finding confidence in myself and my own decisions. I didn't know it then, but those are not\nthe attributes of failure. Those are the attributes of bravery. Now, in 1989, at the age of 26, I became a San Francisco firefighter, and I was the 15th woman\nin a department of 1,500 men. (Applause) And as you can imagine, when I arrived there were many doubts\nabout whether we could do the job. So even though I was a 5'10\",\n150-pound collegiate rower, and someone who could endure\n12 hours of searing knee pain -- (Laughter) I knew I still had to prove\nmy strength and fitness. So one day a call came in for a fire, and sure enough,\nwhen my engine group pulled up, there was black smoke billowing\nfrom a building off an alleyway. And I was with a big guy named Skip, and he was on the nozzle,\nand I was right behind, and it was a typical sort of fire. It was smoky, it was hot, and all of a sudden, there was an explosion, and Skip and I were blown backwards, my mask was knocked sideways, and there was this moment of confusion. And then I picked myself up, I groped for the nozzle, and I did what a firefighter\nwas supposed to do: I lunged forward, opened up the water and I tackled the fire myself. The explosion had been caused\nby a water heater, so nobody was hurt,\nand ultimately it was not a big deal, but later Skip came up to me and said, \"Nice job, Caroline,\" in this surprised sort of voice. (Laughter) And I was confused, because\nthe fire hadn't been difficult physically, so why was he looking at me\nwith something like astonishment? And then it became clear: Skip, who was by the way a really nice guy and an excellent firefighter, not only thought\nthat women could not be strong, he thought that they\ncould not be brave either. And he wasn't the only one. Friends, acquaintances and strangers, men and women throughout my career ask me over and over, \"Caroline, all that fire, all that danger, aren't you scared?\" Honestly, I never heard\na male firefighter asked this. And I became curious. Why wasn't bravery expected of women? Now, the answer began to come when a friend of mine lamented to me that her young daughter\nwas a big scaredy-cat, and so I began to notice, and yes, the daughter was anxious, but more than that,\nthe parents were anxious. Most of what they said to her\nwhen she was outside began with, \"Be careful,\" \"Watch out,\" or \"No.\" Now, my friends were not bad parents. They were just doing what most parents do, which is cautioning their daughters\nmuch more than they caution their sons. There was a study involving\na playground fire pole, ironically, in which researchers saw that little girls\nwere very likely to be warned by both their moms and dads\nabout the fire pole's risk, and if the little girls\nstill wanted to play on the fire pole, a parent was very likely to assist her. But the little boys? They were encouraged\nto play on the fire pole despite any trepidations\nthat they might have, and often the parents offered\nguidance on how to use it on their own. So what message does this send\nto both boys and girls? Well, that girls are fragile\nand more in need of help, and that boys can and should\nmaster difficult tasks by themselves. It says that girls should be fearful and boys should be gutsy. Now, the irony is that at this young age, girls and boys are actually\nvery alike physically. In fact, girls are often\nstronger until puberty, and more mature. And yet we adults act as if girls are more fragile and more in need of help, and they can't handle as much. This is the message\nthat we absorb as kids, and this is the message\nthat fully permeates as we grow up. We women believe it, men believe it, and guess what? As we become parents,\nwe pass it on to our children, and so it goes. Well, so now I had my answer. This is why women, even firewomen, were expected to be scared. This is why women often are scared. Now, I know some of you\nwon't believe me when I tell you this, but I am not against fear. I know it's an important emotion,\nand it's there to keep us safe. But the problem is\nwhen fear is the primary reaction that we teach and encourage in girls whenever they face something\noutside their comfort zone. So I was a paraglider pilot\nfor many years -- (Applause) and a paraglider is a parachute-like wing, and it does fly very well, but to many people I realize\nit looks just like a bedsheet with strings attached. (Laughter) And I spent a lot of time on mountaintops inflating this bedsheet, running off and flying. And I know what you're thinking. You're like, Caroline,\na little fear would make sense here. And you're right, it does. I assure you, I did feel fear. But on that mountaintop, waiting for the wind\nto come in just right, I felt so many other things, too: exhilaration, confidence. I knew I was a good pilot. I knew the conditions were good,\nor I wouldn't be there. I knew how great it was going to be\na thousand feet in the air. So yes, fear was there, but I would take a good hard look at it, assess just how relevant it was and then put it where it belonged, which was more often than not behind my exhilaration, my anticipation and my confidence. So I'm not against fear. I'm just pro-bravery. Now, I'm not saying\nyour girls must be firefighters or that they should be paragliders, but I am saying that we are raising\nour girls to be timid, even helpless, and it begins when we caution them\nagainst physical risk. The fear we learn\nand the experiences we don't stay with us as we become women and morphs into all those things\nthat we face and try to shed: our hesitation in speaking out, our deference so that we can be liked and our lack of confidence\nin our own decisions. So how do we become brave? Well, here's the good news. Bravery is learned, and like anything learned, it just needs to be practiced. So first, we have to take a deep breath and encourage our girls to skateboard, climb trees and clamber around\non that playground fire pole. This is what my own mother did. She didn't know it then, but researchers have a name for this. They call it risky play, and studies show that risky play\nis really important for kids, all kids, because it teaches hazard assessment, it teaches delayed gratification, it teaches resilience, it teaches confidence. In other words, when kids get outside\nand practice bravery, they learn valuable life lessons. Second, we have to stop\ncautioning our girls willy-nilly. So notice next time you say, \"Watch out, you're going to get hurt,\" or, \"Don't do that, it's dangerous.\" And remember that often\nwhat you're really telling her is that she shouldn't be pushing herself, that she's really not good enough, that she should be afraid. Third, we women have to start\npracticing bravery, too. We cannot teach our girls\nuntil we teach ourselves. So here's another thing: fear and exhilaration feel very similar -- the shaky hands,\nthe heightened heart rate, the nervous tension, and I'm betting that for many of you the last time you thought\nyou were scared out of your wits, you may have been feeling\nmostly exhilaration, and now you've missed an opportunity. So practice. And while girls should be getting\noutside to learn to be gutsy, I get that adults don't want\nto get on hoverboards or climb trees, so we all should be practicing at home, in the office and even right here getting up the guts to talk to someone that you really admire. Finally, when your girl is, let's say, on her bike on the top of the steep hill that she insists\nshe's too scared to go down, guide her to access her bravery. Ultimately, maybe that hill\nreally is too steep, but she'll come to that conclusion\nthrough courage, not fear. Because this is not\nabout the steep hill in front of her. This is about the life ahead of her and that she has the tools to handle and assess all the dangers\nthat we cannot protect her from, all the challenges that we won't\nbe there to guide her through, everything that our girls here and around the world face in their future. So by the way, the world record for crawling today -- (Laughter) is 35.18 miles, and I would really love\nto see a girl go break that. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

At some point, we would go\nthrough this whole routine of duct-taping and all the glass doors\nin these big X patterns, tightly boarding up all the windows,\nexcept for one or two -- so that, as my mother\nwould curiously put it, we could let the wind come through. And putting buckets\nin the living room to catch the rain in a futile attempt\nto stop our house from flooding when the roof started to billow\nand sag in the wind. I hated it. Because I was terrified the entire time, whether it was a tropical wave, a thunderstorm, a tropical storm or the tail-end of an actual hurricane\nthat barely missed us. It was all the same to me. A possible end. No light, no water, no electricity, just a simple battery-operated radio\nwaiting for the \"all clear.\" And in my young eyes, Mother Nature on a personal mission\nto destroy us all. I never understood why. Why, if we knew this was going\nto happen every year, why couldn't we just do something\nto make sure that we were safer? Why did I always have to put\nout buckets and hide? Fast forward to where we are now, living through a burgeoning climate crisis where my childhood fears\nhave quickly become my adult reality. Just last year, my country started\nto experience freak storms like none we had ever seen before. This is a video of one such event. Now, this is a real-time capture, it is not sped up,\nthere are no special effects. This system seemingly\nmaterialized out of nowhere. Typically, we'd have advance warning,\nbut this time, there was none. We did not know this was coming\nuntil it was right on top of us. Imagine being jolted out of your sleep to be greeted by this: 500 strikes of lightning per minute, thunder and rain so loud, it felt like it was coming\nfrom the guts of the Earth. The sky looked like\na firework display with no pauses. And while we were still reeling\nfrom the impacts of this event, just a few weeks later,\nanother one hit us. This time a Category 1 hurricane. It destroyed over 2,000 homes. Unpredictable events like this\nare quickly becoming the norm. And in a small country like mine,\nof less than 300,000 people and a mere land area\nof just 166 square miles, small numbers, small events\nstill mean big loss. So for us, who are already living through some\nof the repercussions of climate change, it is simply no longer enough for architecture\nto be beautifully passive. In the face of these\nlooming new realities, we need to create architecture\nthat genuinely performs. So that's what I do. I’m an architectural designer, and I create structures\nthat have a deep reverence and awareness of nature,\nyet protect us from it. I draw on those deceptively\nsimple micro lessons that we as communities\nhave been inspired by over the years that dealt with how we traditionally\nhandle the environment and how we, rather than fighting\nto keep nature out, learned how to harness it\nand embrace it for a shelter. Now, I'm sure there are countless examples of traditional building methodologies\nthat have stood the test of time and weather. Stories of inherent resilience. But I want to share with you\na story from my own country, one that has shaped my perspective\nas I lived through and designed for our changing\nclimate reality. After the abolition of the enslavement of African and Indigenous\npeoples in Barbados, my ancestors, newly freed, couldn't just go and find land\nto build their homes. Their lands, unlike them,\nwere still property or \"chattel\" of the former enslavers. So out of this conundrum the Bajan chattel house was born. Chattel houses were modest homes\nbuilt entirely of timber, with no nails mind you, and sat on tightly packed coral stone. The dilemma was that they\nhad to be robust enough to survive the harsh temperaments\nof our tropical weather, yet somehow temporary, so that inevitably,\nwhen there was some kind of \"dispute\" between a former enslaver\nand a newly freed man or woman, he or she could quickly grab\na couple of friends and family, pack up and move\nat a moment's notice for safety. So how? How, despite being so\nlow-tech and temporary, could these endemic designs survive\noften to see another day? Unlike many of the more established,\nrobust and permanent homes. Well, since these were made from whatever\ntimber was readily available, there were no fancy\nproprietary systems used. So rather than trying to create\nsome kind of impenetrable force field against the wind, we had to get creative and figure out\nhow to work with the wind instead of against it. And when the wind is blowing\nat incredible force against a home that simply does not have\nthe adequate means to brace itself, options are limited. Gets kind of simple. Like my mother used to tell me,\nyou let the wind come through. Now, the trick to doing this lies\nunexpectedly in the arrangement of the timber facade, with windows such as these\ncalled \"jalousie\" windows. And a quick side note, jalousie actually comes\nfrom the French word “jalousie” meaning \"jealousy.\" So originally, these angled horizontal slats\ncalled louvers were meant to keep jealous,\npeering eyes from seeing into your home. But architecturally, what they did was allow wind\nto filter through while still keeping rain out. So these intentionally aligned apertures would allow you to open all the slats\non the windows and doors to literally let\nthe hurricane pass through, channeling that wind through\nthe building's interior, instead of building up\ndestructive pressure on the facade. The result was that the weather, as I might say, if I was at home, “might ’lick down ya house,\nbut it aint gine mash it up.” Translation for those who need it: the compound effect\nof these micro solutions was a house that might ... it might bend, but it wouldn't totally break. Drawing on examples such as this, I quickly realized that as a region, we really need to depart\nfrom this more global convention of designing our buildings\nto close themselves off from nature so that architecture, for us, becomes less about\nthe external expression, aesthetic and shape of the building, but more about its holistic performance\nin concert with the environment. Like those jalousie windows, it's about those micro solutions, those little details that quite literally\nmake or break a building. For example, after the passage of Hurricane Maria\nthrough the Caribbean in 2017, many properties suffered devastating loss. As designers, we were faced with that\nnow common question: How do we build back better? The answer? Simple. You take what works, discard what doesn't, and apply it to modern designs. In one instance, the wind-dispersing capabilities\nof those traditional louvers became a modern interpretation. So my team and I at the time\ndesigned a timber fin facade that would do the same thing: break up the wind\nagainst the building's exterior while still allowing light to penetrate\nto the building's interior, all while protecting the exposed\nglass from wind and wind driven missiles. So no more duct tape. In another instance, we designed a sacrificial central core that allowed wind to penetrate\nthrough the interior of the building while preserving adjacent, locked-down watertight bunkers zones for people to retreat\nfrom the wind and the rain. So no more buckets. And many of my colleagues\nin island nations, such as my own, are in the process of integrating\nthis similar strategy of taking traditional designs\nand applying them to modern approaches. And this is not just limited\nto hurricanes, but address issues such as floods,\nearthquakes, landslides, where traditional, stilted designs\nhelp to keep us elevated above torrential downpour and inundation and where cross-brace lattice elements make sure our buildings\nare flexible enough to withstand the Earth moving\nand shaking beneath them. We are at a point now where we model\nan intelligent digital twin of each design in virtual reality. Think of it as a sort of computerized 3D\ncarbon copy of each micro solution, so that we can stress-test it. We can throw real-world\nclimate scenarios its way. And because we’re in that\nvirtual environment, there's no loss of human life, there's no costly\ndamage to infrastructure, and we can pick a building apart and figure out what it actually takes\nto make a more resilient structure. We can, say, throw a Category 5\nhurricane wind simulation its way, and if it fails in that safe\nenvironment, we can fix it. We can tweak it, we can improve it, we can optimize the design, and we can do that iteratively\nuntil we get it right. And because we have started\nfrom these Indigenous references, we end up with well-performing, modern, yes, but accessible architecture that is not alien to its cultural\nor climatic context. Architecture that is not alien -- (Applause) Architecture that is not alien to the people who must build\nand live in it. Architecture that by testing\nand design is more resilient as we prepare for harsher weather. Now, I've said a lot. But nothing ... Nothing prepares you\nfor the mental uncertainty of experiencing, and hopefully\nliving through, a hurricane. That feeling of total vulnerability. Of being fully exposed to the elements\nand at the absolute mercy ... of nature. The sound of the wind\nripping a building to pieces. The sound of your neighbors’\nscreams being carried away in that same wind. The “What if?” \"What if they don't make it?\" \"What if we don't make it?\" \"What if I don't make it?\" \"What if?\" But what if we could design away\nsome of that uncertainty and shelter in place\nwith a sense of confidence that we have given ourselves\nthe best chance at surviving, the best chance at weathering each storm? Across the world, as humans,\nwe are doing amazing things. We are putting people\ninto space for leisure. (Applause) We are searching and figuring out\nhow to live in and survive the extremes of distant\nplanetary climates. Yes, that's amazing. However, on this planet, so many of us still live in constant fear that the next event will be the big one that either dramatically changes\nor outright claims our existence here on planet Earth forever. You've probably heard this\na million times, but we as small island nations\nare living in our present, the future that you all\nare poised to face. So we need to know now what works\nand what does not in our specific contexts, because it is a true, immediate,\ncyclical matter of life and death for us. So. As we step into this new era, as we design and build our future\ncities and communities, the approach, again, is so simple. We must do so no longer leaving the most\nvulnerable of us to guess and hope for the best. But based on tried,\ntested, traditional knowledge and lived experience, designing for the absolute worst. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 6, "lesson": 9, "title": "How to deal with rejection", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-deal-with-rejection", "transcript": {"en": "Rejection hurts. It’s incredibly painful\nto feel like you’re not wanted— and we do mean painful. fMRI studies have found that rejection\nelicits brain activity in multiple neural regions\nthat process physical pain. And the language we use to describe\nrejection mirrors this experience. Researchers recorded over a dozen\nlanguages that relate rejection to being hurt, using terms like \n“crushed” or “broken-hearted.” So why does rejection trigger\nsuch a strong response, and is there any way to cope \nwith this unique kind of pain? Psychologists often describe rejection as what happens when we perceive \nthat others don’t value having social connections with us. This could occur when we’re\nabandoned by a romantic partner, excluded from a group,\nor outright discriminated against. But it’s worth noting that these\ninterpersonal rejections have a social element that distinguishes\nthem from not getting a job. In these experiences, we perceive that the rejecting party \nundervalues our relationship. And while the pain of rejection\noften increases the more we value a relationship, even rejections by relative strangers\ncan hurt our feelings. This might seem like an overreaction, but just as bodily pain warns \nus about perceived threats to our physical well-being, hurt feelings warn us about perceived\nthreats to our social well-being. Some behavioral psychologists\nargue this warning system developed when our prehistoric ancestors lived\nin small clans and depended on everyone they knew \nfor survival. These humans may have evolved to perceive\nrejection from anyone as a potential threat to their safety. It’s impossible to confirm this\nkind of evolutionary theory, but wherever this warning\nsystem came from, it doesn't include instructions for how to process this intense\nemotional experience. So, the next time you’re feeling rejected,\ntry asking yourself these questions. The first thing to consider\nis your relationship with the person rejecting you. Is this someone who knows you well\nand whose opinion you hold dear? Or is it just a loose acquaintance? If it’s the latter, that might help\nyou answer the second question: does this rejection really matter? It can sting when a stranger\ndoesn't laugh at your joke, but it doesn’t make sense\nto react strongly to a rejection with little impact on your life. Of course, brushing off even a minor \nrejection is easier said than done, since how you perceive yourself \nalso factors into this equation. You likely feel more confident \nin some circumstances than others, and people tend to be especially sensitive\nto rejection in situations where they have a low opinion\nof themselves. So much so, that they even become \nmore likely to misinterpret other people’s neutral reactions \nas rejections. This is why it can be helpful \nto both reflect on your self-view and ask yourself if the other person\nis actually rejecting you. This might seem like an odd question. But you may find that while the\nother person didn’t treat you as you would have liked, \nthey still value your relationship. In some cases, it's also\nhelpful to consider whether you were expecting more acceptance\nthan was reasonable. Unfortunately, after asking\nthese questions, you might still conclude \nthat a person close to you doesn’t value your relationship\nas much as you do. This is a painful realization, but it\ncan help to remember two things. First, this rejection isn't\njust about you. The other party wants something different\nfrom your relationship, and what they want might \nbe unreasonable, unfair, or simply not what you have to give. Second, their rejection isn’t proof \nthat there’s something wrong with you. The pain you’re feeling \nis just part of a system nudging you to think about\nyour interpersonal relationships. And by reflecting on your behavior, you can find clues to help better\nunderstand the rejection and think critically \nabout the relationship you want to have with this person. Every relationship and rejection \nis unique. But whatever the specifics, it’s important to remember \nthat you’re never alone in all of this. Everyone deals with rejection\nthroughout their life— even those who seem confident\nin their belonging. And one of the most common ways to cope\nwith this universal experience is to reconnect with those \nwho already accept you."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "fMRI studies have shown that the ways in which the brain processes both rejection and ___ are neurologically similar.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hunger"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Physical pain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Boredom"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Creativity"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When an individual feels rejected, they are perceiving that the rejecting party ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Finds them fundamentally flawed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Wants to cause them harm"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Undervalues their relationship"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Is their enemy"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why do some psychologists believe the fear of rejection is a prehistoric human trait?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Survival depended upon the support of a community."}, {"label": "B", "text": "There are prehistoric records of social ostracism."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Scientists have proven its evolutionary origins through brain imaging."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All humans fear rejection.

It was founded and led by people escaping\nfrom slavery, also called maroons. In fact, it was one of the world’s\nlargest maroon communities, its population reaching beyond 10,000. And its citizens were at constant war \nwith colonial forces. The records we have about Palmares\nmainly come from biased Dutch and Portuguese sources, but historians have managed \nto piece much of its story together. During the Trans-Atlantic slave trade,\nwhich began in the 1500s, nearly half of all enslaved African people\nwere sent to Portugal’s American colony: Brazil. Some escaped and sought\nshelter in Brazil’s interior regions, where they formed settlements\ncalled mocambos or quilombos. Fugitives from slavery probably arrived\nin the northeast in the late 1500s. By the 1660s, their camps\nhad consolidated into a powerful confederation known today\nas the Quilombo of Palmares. It consisted of a central capital\nlinking dozens of villages, which specialized in particular\nagricultural goods or served as military training grounds. Citizens of Palmares, or Palmaristas,\nwere governed by a king and defended by an organized military. African people and Brazilian-born \nBlack and Indigenous people all came seeking refuge. They collectively fished, hunted,\nraised livestock, planted orchards, and grew crops \nlike cassava, corn, and sugarcane. They also made use of the abundant \npalm trees for which Palmares was named, turning palm products \ninto butter, wine, and light. Palmaristas crafted palm husks into pipes\nand leaves into mats and baskets. They traded some of these goods\nwith Portuguese settlers for products like gunpowder and salt. In turn, settlers avoided Palmares’ raids during which they’d seize weapons\nand take captives. The Portuguese were concerned \nwith other invading imperialists, but regarded Indigenous\nuprisings and Palmares as their internal threats. Palmares endangered the very\ninstitution of slavery— the foundation of Brazil's economy. During the 1670s, the Portuguese\nescalated their attacks. By this time, Ganga-Zumba\nwas Palmares’ leader. He ruled from the Macaco, \nwhich functioned as the capital. His allies and family members\ngoverned the other villages— with women playing crucial roles \nin operation and defense. As they fought the Portuguese, Palmaristas\nused the landscape to their advantage. Camouflaged and built in high places,\ntheir mocambos offered superior lookouts. They constructed hidden ditches lined\nwith sharp stakes that swallowed unsuspecting soldiers \nand false roads that led to ambushes. They launched counterattacks\nunder the cover of night and were constantly abandoning \nand building settlements to elude the Portuguese. In 1678, after years of failed attacks, the Portuguese offered to negotiate\na peace treaty with Ganga-Zumba. The terms they agreed upon recognized\nPalmares’ independence and the freedom of anyone born there. However, the treaty demanded that Palmares\npledge loyalty to the crown and return all past and future\nfugitives from slavery. Many Palmaristas dissented, among them Zumbi— Ganga-Zumba’s nephew—\na rising leader himself. Before long, Ganga-Zumba was killed, likely by a group affiliated\nwith his nephew. As Palmares’ new leader, \nZumbi rejected the treaty and resumed resistance \nfor another 15 years. But in February of 1694, the Portuguese captured the capital \nafter a devastating siege. Zumbi escaped, but they eventually\nfound and ambushed him. And on November 20th, 1695, \nPortuguese forces killed Zumbi. His death was not the end of Palmares,\nbut it was a crushing blow. After years of warfare, \nthere were far fewer rebels in the area. Those who remained rallied around new\nleaders and maintained a presence, however small, through the 1760s. Though, Palmares is no more thousands \nof other quilombos persist to this day. November 20th, the day of Zumbi’s death,\nis celebrated across Brazil as the Day of Black Consciousness. But Zumbi was just one \nof many Palmaristas. We only know some of their names, but their fight for freedom \nechoes centuries later."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When do we think fugitive slaves first arrived in the area that became Palmares?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Late 1400s"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Late 1500s "}, {"label": "C", "text": "Late 1600s"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Late 1700s"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Besides quilombo, what is the most common name for fugitive-slave settlements in Brazil?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Capoeira"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bossa Nova"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mocambo"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Samba"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What was Palmares named for?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Its first leader"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A nearby river"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Abundant palm trees in the area"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Forest animals that lived nearby"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who led Palmares after the 1678 peace treaty fell apart?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ganga-Zumba"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Acotirene"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Madalena"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Zumbi"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What happened on November 20, 1695?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Portuguese killed Zumbi"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Palmares and the Portuguese signed a peace treaty"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fighting between Palmares and the Portuguese began"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A massive earthquake shook the region"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

About a third of all teenage\ngamers in America do. Do you think the government\nis actually run by a secret cabal of demon-worshiping perverts? About 50 million people do. (Laughter) These numbers sound crazy to you? It's because they are, but they're also a sign of things to come. The world feels like a pretty\ninsane place right now. And if you spend any time\non the internet at all, you can probably tell that people think\nit's going to get a lot worse. Now, that may be the case, but this feeling is why I believe that we're going to see\na rise in social unrest in the coming decades, and that is going to come\nfrom a surprising place. Video games. Now before you think,\n\"Is this going to be another talk linking video game to violence?\" Sorry to disappoint you, that’s been proven conclusively wrong,\nand that is really old thinking. But what I am going to argue\nis that video games are going to become the platform through which\ntomorrow's social battles will be fought and the source of recruitment\nfor some of the strangest and possibly most impactful\nsocial movements of the future. I like to call these video gamecults. Sounds kind of scary, I admit, but I hope to show\nhow they might also be used as a tool to cause some serious hope. Now this is all just my personal opinion. But I started thinking\nabout this a few years ago after I heard a very interesting story\nwhile working in the Gulf. The story was about Hassan ibn Sabbah, a charismatic young preacher\nwho lived about 1,000 years ago in an age full of drama,\nconflict and social change. Hassan became famous for creating\nthe Order of Assassins: a fanatically devoted group of young men known as the fedayeen, \"those who sacrifice themselves.\" His men were so devoted to him that, the legend goes, they would throw themselves\nfrom the rafters to their death at his command. Actually, this is where we get\nthe expression \"a leap of faith\" from. So this got me thinking. Why would someone do this? What could convince someone\nso fervently to believe in something that they would welcome their own death? The answer is 11th century\nvirtual reality. See, Hassan had cultivated a myth that he could send people to heaven\nand bring them back again without actually having to die. And of course, he didn't\nactually have this power, but before a mission, the story goes, he would dose his soldiers\nwith massive amounts of hash. (Laughter) Their enemies actually called them\nthe \"ḥashshāshīn,\" which is also where we get\nthe word \"assassin\" from. This would knock them out\nand then he would lower them down into a secret garden he had built\nbehind his mountain fortress, designed to look exactly\nlike a replica of heaven. Waking up in this simulated paradise, his men would gorge themselves on all the things\nthey had been denied in life. Then, after a night of ecstasy, they would awaken back in their barracks, convinced of Hassan's powers, eager to fulfill his suicide missions\nin order to return to heaven again. So. What does this have to do with today? Well, most scholars agree\nthat this is probably just a myth, but that's not the point. The point is that people\nbelieved deeply in Hassan and his vision for the world and were willing to sacrifice\ntheir lives for it. He gave them a sense\nof meaning and purpose during a time of great uncertainty. A purpose which he communicated\nusing the best tools of his day. And that is what brings us to video games. Video games are already the world's\ndominant form of entertainment. They're three times larger than the entire global film\nand music industries combined. Every year, the top streamers on Twitch\nreceive on average twice as many views as the biggest Hollywood movies. And collectively, we spend twice as much time\nwatching and playing video games as we do using all other forms\nof social media combined. That's a lot of eyeballs. Game sales are huge, but the real action\nis in in-game economies where people spend\nover 130 billion dollars a year buying and selling virtual goods online. Everything from outfits to avatars,\nto vehicles to weapons, to dances to architecture to music, to access to live events and more. Haven't even mentioned NFT or Web3, but these hopefully\nwill become the infrastructure that drives this going forward. So if you're wondering\nwhat the metaverse looks like, this is it. The reason games are so successful is because they provide\na deep sense of engagement, community and purpose. Yes, we use them to escape\nand to entertain, and that’s OK. But at their best, they speak to some of our primal\nsocial and psychological needs, from feeling effective\nto achieving our goals, to belonging to a group, to working for something\nbigger than yourself. Describing his experience\nin a top World of Warcraft guild, the player Wincy once wrote, \"It felt so amazing... Thinking back, it was probably\nthe most intense, positive emotional experience of my life. Not my kid being born,\nnot getting married.\" (Laughter) \"My mind was convinced we were in a war\nagainst an insurmountable foe and we won.\" You can probably see\nwhere I'm going with this. Although he later went on to regret\nthe amount of time he spent online, gamers develop a deep sense of commitment\nto a shared narrative world. A world which provides for them\nin a way that \"real-world\" jobs and relationships often do not. And this is already the world\nthat our children live in. The only thing that my son and daughter\nwant for their birthdays are Skyblock coins and digital emotes\nfor their characters. Most of their social time\noutside of school is spent hanging out in-game\nwith their friends. My son Teo, he's already\nflipping NFTs to, in his words, get rich as quickly as possible so he can take care of us\nwhen the world falls apart. Thanks Teo, appreciate that. That's why I think games are going to be one of the driving forces\nof tomorrow's culture. But if that's the game's part,\nwhat about the cults part? Well, I'm sure we can all agree that the coming years are going to be\ninteresting, to say the least. From climate change, mass migration, pandemics, job loss and now war. The future feels terrifying\nfor many people. And this is having a tremendous impact\non our mental health. One third of all\nUS undergraduates surveyed report having moderate to severe anxiety. Their rates of suicidal thinking\nand severe depression doubled over the last decade or so. And COVID didn't help. But it's not just the US, either. Two thirds of those surveyed\nin a study of 17 different countries reported that they thought their children\nwere going to grow up poorer and not have successful careers. In other words, the world feels like it's falling apart\nfor a lot of people. And when worlds fall apart, people start looking for answers\nwherever they can find them. And charismatic leaders like Hassan\nhave always been happy to provide them. And their actions have shaped\nthe course of history. From the Protestant Reformation\nin the 16th century to the rise of new religious movements\nin the 19th century, every era of social change historically\nhas been followed by a wave of new believers and fanatical behavior. QAnon is just the most recent example. And while each generation's\ncults look different and the definition of a cult\nis certainly up for debate, they do share general characteristics. The first is that they inspire\na sense of higher purpose, often through a lens of good versus evil,\nwhere you are the hero, that creates a sense of passion\nor commitment that seems insane or irrational to the outsider. And the second is\nthat they adopt the form of and use the tools of the dominant\norganizations of their day. From the church to the corporation to the social media network to our subject for today, the metaverse. So what happens when you mix\nbillions of people looking for meaning, safety and security with widespread virtual worlds, crypto economies and gaming culture? The answer, I believe, is “gamecults.” Large-scale social movements powered by extreme or bizarre beliefs, birthed in virtual worlds, driven by game dynamics, but with real-world consequence. The future is about to get weird. We can already see examples\nof this all around us. We just haven't had a name for it yet. Softer versions look like BTS stans\nswarming Donald Trump rallies online, but more extreme versions look like\nHezbollah's own custom-made video game called Special Forces,\ndesigned to recruit young people and train them to kill their enemies. White nationalist groups are hosting\nCall of Duty tournaments online to attract followers, and there are Roblox games\nwhere you can drive your car through Black Lives Matter protesters or assume the role of Kyle Rittenhouse\nand shoot anti-fascist protesters. And there are many other examples, but all of them are wrapped\nin a layer of Discord servers and YouTube channels and podcasts that act as the funnel to draw you\ndeeper into a web of extremism and radical behavior. What starts on the screen\nno longer stays on the screen. QAnon is a perfect example of this. What started on 4chan and Facebook, mutated into a live-action\nrole-playing group for evangelical militants and ended up as\nan anti-vaccination campaign. Before you know it, we have a million excess deaths\nfrom COVID in the United States and a political landscape far stranger\nthan anything we've ever seen. The same is going to be true for games. First you're a player, then you're a fan, soon you're in a clan, and before you know it,\nyou're invading the Capitol. So I'm a futurist. And there's a saying with futurists, that your job is not to just\npredict the automobile, but to predict the traffic jams. So what might this look like\nin 10 or 20 years, when widespread augmented\nand virtual reality meets thriving crypto economies\nand a generalized crisis of meaning? Well in the future, games are going to be everywhere. They're going to move from our screens\nand onto the streets around us. Hundreds of millions,\nif not billions of people will be buying, selling, making\nand trading virtual goods online. They're going to assume\nroles as characters, follow quests and get real-world money\nfor in-game performance. Guilds, corporations and clans\nwill form around them. They might start offering\nsalaries, paying benefits, and providing real-world services like\neducation or health care or even security. People's entire lives will be built\naround their characters and their stories, particularly if things get really bad. And those stories will come to dominate\npopular culture and politics. Now, thankfully,\nnot all of them will be harmful, but some will be violently\nevangelical in their nature. It's got me thinking,\nthere must be a better way that we can use these dynamics to heal instead of harm. So I started thinking,\nwhat might this look like? How can we explore possible futures\nfor positive gamecults? So here are just three examples\nI came up with a few friends. Consider Druidica,\na Minecraft-like nature game designed to restore damaged ecosystems and preserve indigenous knowledge. Or perhaps Walkabout, a Rust-like survival game for refugees designed to encourage skill sharing, interdependence and mutual aid linked to scriptural messages\nof tolerance and compassion. Or perhaps Temple, a pray-to-earn game, linked to a network\nof nondenominational meditation spaces where players can perform\ncoordinated acts of care to level up on the good works board. A kind of, decentralized\nchurch of kindness, powered maybe by HOLY coin. It's clear that something\nlike this is coming. The question is:\nWhat can we do about it now? As we've learned from social media, technological fixes and regulatory\nrestrictions will only go so far. And in the attention economy\nof political priorities, gamecults are clearly quite low. But that’s OK, it means we still have time\nto do something about them. That's why I think that everyone, from policymakers to players\nto game designers and gamers should be having a conversation\nabout what this means right now. If you are a media company, you should be talking\nto experts in radicalization. If you are a game company, you should be speaking to those\nwho don't understand gaming dynamics and the communities around them. If you're a church\nor a religious institution, you should be understanding how people\nuse these tools to build beliefs and what they're believing. And finally, perhaps most importantly,\nif you're a parent, you should be playing games with your kids to understand the world\nthat they're growing up in and to have a conversation with them\nabout the role that they might play in it. Someone's going to connect these dots. The question is: Who is going to be our modern-day Hassan? And will the games of tomorrow\nbe games of subjugation and domination? Or inspiration and liberation. It's really up to us. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Perhaps a day of friendly competition\nwill lead us to the answer. Tomorrow’s the annual Brain Clash— ten teams of two competing in a decathlon\nof mental challenges, trivia competitions, and puzzles. I’ve been training all year. I’ll need to pick the smartest,\nmost capable teammate. I’ve narrowed down the roster. First we have Gabriela. She may only be 8, \nbut don’t underestimate her! She’s fluent in two languages and \nis the ultimate outside-the-box thinker. Then there’s Ama. She can recite 100 digits of pi, \ndesigns satellites for a living, and bakes a perfect soufflé. Or I could go with Mr. Taylor. He’s the best chess player\nin the neighborhood, not to mention he’s competed \nin over 20 Brain Clashes and is a five-time champion! I’m not sure who to pick!\nWho’s the smartest? Which of these teammates should Amir\nchoose for tomorrow's contest and why? Of course, it depends. While intelligence is often associated\nwith things like IQ tests, these assessments fail to capture\nthe scope and depth of a person’s varied abilities. So instead, we’ll break down the idea \nof “smart” into categories like creativity, memory, and learning and explore when the brain’s best\nat each of them. Let's start at the very beginning. In the first few years of life, your brain undergoes incredible \nrapid growth, called synaptogenesis, where more than 1 million new neural\nconnections are formed every second. As the brain develops, it goes\nthrough a pruning process. Based on your experience and environment, used connections are strengthened \nand unused connections are removed. Frequently used neuronal pathways\nare myelinated, wrapped in a layer of insulation, \nallowing information to travel faster. This creates a more efficient,\nfine-tuned brain. But this brain remodeling happens \nwithin and between brain regions at different times, allowing different skills \nto flourish at different ages. For example, in childhood, brain regions\ninvolved in language learning develop quickly, which is why many children can\nlearn and master multiple languages. Yet the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible \nfor cognitive control and inhibition, is slower to develop. As a result, some young children may\nstruggle with strategic games, such as chess or checkers, which require constant concentration, \nplanning, and abstract thought. At the same time, children tend to be more\nflexible, exploration-based learners. They often use more creative approaches\nwhen finding solutions to riddles and are, on average, \nless afraid to make mistakes. But adults have their own\nunique set of abilities. Adults benefit from a well-developed\nprefrontal cortex, allowing them to better execute skills\nthat require learning, focus, and memory, making them quick and efficient \npuzzle solvers or crossword masters. Late in adulthood, \nthese same skills may decline as the brain’s memory center, \nknown as the hippocampus, shrinks. But there’s a reason for the phrase\n“older and wiser.” After a lifetime of learning, older adults have more knowledge\nto recall and utilize, making them excellent trivia partners. Other factors that Amir should consider\nare his own strengths. As an adolescent, the prefrontal cortical \nregions of your brain are more developed than in childhood. This allows you to better navigate\nlogic and math puzzles. Simultaneously,\ndeep inside the brain, regions that are important in motivation\nand reward are developing even faster, driving teenagers like Amir to be \ncurious and adventurous learners. In many ways, you can think\nof the teenager as a jack-of-all-trades, with brains wired to seek out new \nexperiences  and learn quickly.

They spend the entire school year planning to colonize\nthe planet Alpha Centauri to preserve future generations. They will get there\non a multigenerational spacecraft so that the grandkids\nof the people on the ship will arrive at Alpha Centauri,\nready to start a new civilization. Now projects like these usually start\nwith a guiding question, and theirs is \"How do you sustain life\nfor a generation on a spacecraft?\" These 10-year-olds\nget into initial conversations about governance on the spacecraft, the necessities to have on board. Is it even ethical to have a generation\nlive and die on a spacecraft? And what roles are needed\nto create a functioning community? There are some whispers and some head nods as the teacher explains to them\nthat this quarter, they're expected to deliver\na persuasive essay, a 30-second elevator speech, a model of a section\nof the spacecraft in diorama form, a system of government\nwith laws and a constitution, and a research display\ndemonstrating their knowledge of planets. That's a lot. (Laughter) But these students aren't fazed,\nthey'd been here before. What they're interested in\nis what group they'll be in and what roles they will play. Now I don't know about you, but when I was in fifth grade,\nI wasn't doing that. (Laughter) But for many of these students, they have been learning like this\nsince kindergarten. You heard that right, kindergarten. Shoot, when I was in fifth grade ... we sat in cemetery rows\nin academically segregated classrooms, and sadly, things have not changed. In most schools, students are sitting,\nlistening to the teacher, and many of them scared to death they'll get called on\nto answer a question. And too often,\nstudents are totally deflated, because the teacher is spending more time\non classroom management than engaging them. So these students\nand the generations behind them ... they are our talent pool for everything from community organizing to running business,\nto running government, and everything in between. And as it stands,\nour public education system is not cultivating future leaders. And in particular, students of color are constantly\ndevalued and marginalized. Regardless of background, students need to envision themselves\nas successful in life. And how teachers deliver the lessons\nplays a big role in that. The most common way to teach is through a textbook\nor a series of textbooks and a scripted curriculum. And then, let the test decide\nif the students learned anything. And while you get coverage, it leaves little room for student voice,\nexploration, intellectual rigor and academic risk-taking. This is schooling, not educating. And the long-term impact is that students likely won't have\nthat autonomous spirit they need in the work environment. This is not what most teachers\nsigned up for. It's not. I don't think there's a single\nteacher candidate that said, \"I want to be a teacher so I can help kids pass\nstandardized tests.\" (Laughter) (Applause) Twenty-five years ago,\nI left my 17-year tech career and cofounded a nonprofit that prepared students of color\nfor jobs in the tech industry. And over time, we learned about our students' experiences\nin the public education system, and we began to wonder what would happen\nif we rebuilt public schools to develop the genius in every student and give them the tools\nto be critical thinkers, problem solvers, ideators and leaders. So we got a bunch of educators\nto help us answer that question. Today, my job is to set\nthe vision and strategy for how we partner with public schools to create collaborative,\nanti-racist learning environments grounded in equity, where students can actively participate\nin their own education, instead of memorizing for tests, where the curriculum is delivered in a way that supports\nthe needs of our students. Where professionals in the community are invited to participate\nin teaching and learning. The teaching and learning is built on interdisciplinary\nproject-based learning. One of the most equitable ways to teach. This approach enables teachers\nto understand how each student learns, use multiple ways\nto assess their knowledge and then make instructional adjustments\nbased on the results. You know, students, they get a chance\nto set their own goals. They have time to discuss the work. They take academic risks. And along the way, they get to discover\nwho they are as learners. And speaking of learners, let's take a visit\nto our fifth-grade Alpha Centaurians, and listen in as their teacher\nfacilitates a discussion about how Native Americans live. They talk about the logistics and the preparation behind\nthe colonizers' move out West, and how colonizers always had conflicts\nwith Native Americans. And the students vow\nthat they will do better on Alpha Centauri. They will ensure that everyone\nhas equal rights and lives well. And you better believe\nit will be part of their constitution. And if you poke your head\nin the classroom next door, which is rather loud, you will see the kids\nare in their small groups, using their math skills to calculate\nthe human capacity for their spacecraft. And another set of students\nwill be working on their planet research. When we visit, a week or so later, there might be a visiting engineer talking to the students\nabout design specifications. Or the classroom could be empty because the students\nare at the Museum of Flight, sitting in real spacecraft\nand learning how they work. Bringing that authentic\ncontext to learning helps students retain knowledge\nand generate new ideas. After weeks and weeks\nof working on their projects and giving each other authentic,\nsupportive feedback, and doing that fine-tuning, the students are ready for the big day -- the exhibition of learning. This is where hundreds of people\nfrom the community, the most important members\nbeing their parents and families, come to see the students\npresent their work. The students are all dressed up. They're a little nervous, they're excited at the same time -- kind of like me right now. (Laughter) And the teachers are beaming with pride as they recognize how far each student\nhas come in their learning journey. OK, and the parents? The parents are high-fiving, and \"You get it, girl!\" And \"That's my baby,\" and \"You go, boy.\" And there's just so much praise. And the students feel accomplished\nand more confident. This is project-based learning in action. These students are developing the advanced critical thinking skills\nthey will use throughout their lives. They are learning through exploration. There is confirmation\ntheir unique voice matters. These students have the freedom to create a world,\nwith their ten-year-old imaginations, that's actually grounded\nin academic rigor. This is educating ... versus schooling. Yeah? (Cheers and applause) There is teacher support, diverse interactions ... team-building and practical application of reading,\nwriting, math and science. An environment where real\nlearning is happening, and students are discovering\ntheir own genius. Plus, I have to say, it's just a lot of fun to learn this way. (Laughter) Students who attend\nour partner schools ... learn this way in every single stage\nof their academic career. Starting in kindergarten, students are encouraged\nto share their views, to ask questions and support each other. They are creating a community and an environment that is safe and their own. In middle school, the students are starting\nto become socially aware. They care about things like world hunger,\nimmigration and homelessness. One year, the seventh-graders\nat TAF at Saghalie in Federal Way turned their classrooms\ninto an immigration museum exploring the historic and contemporary\nissues of immigration. And the sixth-graders use food to learn\nabout each other's cultures. They created cookbooks with recipes and stories\nfrom their countries of origin. And then on exhibition night,\nthey cooked for everybody, and it was actually pretty good. (Laughter) By the time students get to high school, they have enough experience that they can address a wide range\nof issues and opportunities. A group of 10th-graders\ncreated wearable technology that detected the flare-up signs\nin sickle-cell anemia. Experiencing gentrification\nin their own neighborhoods, 11th-graders created plans and models for equitable, financially sustainable\nurban neighborhoods. The list goes on and on. This ... This is how we develop the strong, the strong leaders\nand critical thinkers of tomorrow. Our students deserve to learn in an environment that includes\nand understands their unique voice, their individual genius. If we are going to rebuild\npublic education, we have to be on a continuous cycle of recognizing, intentionally undoing, and, ultimately, replacing\nthe institutional practices that undereducate and harm our children. And there are a couple of things\nthat we can do right now. We could reallocate\nthe tens of millions of dollars each state spends\non standardized tests every year. (Applause) Alright. (Applause) And we can invest the majority of that\nin teacher professional development so that our teachers can continually hone\ntheir instructional and assessment skills. And then, we could take the rest and invest it in a national effort\nto curate authentic assessment methods and projects from teachers\nall over the country. I believe that this will bring joy and respect back to teaching. We also need to embed racial equity\nin the DNA of how we operate schools. (Applause) Achieving racial equity is a journey that requires dedication,\nconsistency and accountability. It needs to be normalized as part of the daily practice\nof principals, administrators, teachers and staff. We can do this. We can. All it takes is political will. Education either functions\nas an instrument to bring about conformity or freedom. Let’s give our children freedom. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 6, "lesson": 14, "title": "How does alcohol cause hangovers? - Judy Grisel", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-does-alcohol-cause-hangovers-judy-grisel", "transcript": {"en": "In a 1973 study, 20 volunteers got drunk\nonce a week for 8 consecutive weeks, each time on a different \nalcoholic beverage, and each time with precisely \nthe same dosage— this was science,\nafter all. The goal of this experiment was to find\nout which alcoholic drinks cause worse hangovers. Of course, it takes much more than one \nsmall study to answer such a question. Since then, science has\nlearned a lot about hangovers— though some mysteries remain. The molecule responsible \nfor hangovers is ethanol, which we colloquially refer to as alcohol. Ethanol is present in all alcoholic\nbeverages, and generally speaking, the more ethanol, \nthe greater the potential for a hangover. The symptoms and severity can vary\ndepending on weight, age, genetics, and other factors. But still, hangovers generally share \nsome common— and unpleasant— features. So how exactly does alcohol\ncause a hangover? And is there any way \nto reliably prevent one? Alcohol slows down the communication\nbetween neural cells. After someone has had their last drink, as the concentration of alcohol \nin the blood drops back to zero, the brain rebounds from sedation \nand swings in the other direction, entering a hyperactive state. This may lead to the tremors or \nrapid heartbeat associated with hangovers. It also makes sleep shorter \nand less restful than normal. But these effects are just the beginning— alcohol impacts so many \nof the body’s processes, throwing delicate balances off-kilter. And even the most familiar hangover\nsymptoms have surprising contributors. For example, alcohol disrupts\nlevels of many hormones. One of those hormones is cortisol. Normally, fluctuating cortisol levels\nhelp regulate wakefulness throughout the day and night. So the disruption in cortisol \nduring a hangover may cause people to feel groggy \nor disoriented. Another hormone alcohol interferes\nwith is vasopressin, which normally decreases the volume \nof urine made by the kidneys. By decreasing levels of vasopressin, alcohol causes people to pee more\nand become dehydrated. Dehydration can lead to thirst, dry mouth,\nweakness, lightheadedness, and headache, one of the most common hangover symptoms. In addition to dehydration, \nhangover headaches can result from alcohol’s influence \non chemical signaling in the brain, especially on neurotransmitters\ninvolved in pain signaling. Alcohol can also damage mitochondria, which are responsible for producing\nthe ATP that gives us energy. This may contribute to the fatigue,\nweakness, and mood disturbances experienced during a hangover. Meanwhile, alcohol stimulates\nthe immune system, leading to inflammation that can\ndamage cells within the brain, affect mood, and impair memory. And it can irritate \nthe gastrointestinal tract and inflame the lining \nof the stomach and intestines. Alcohol may also slow down\nstomach emptying, which could lead to increased\nproduction of gastric acid. This is why alcohol can cause \nstomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Alcoholic drinks also contain other\nsubstances that are produced during the fermentation process \nthat give the drink its specific flavor. Some evidence suggests that one of these,\nmethanol, is particularly bad for hangovers. The body doesn’t start\nmetabolizing methanol until it’s done processing ethanol. And when it does, \nthe toxic metabolites of methanol may potentially worsen \nthe hangover symptoms. Beverages that are closer to pure ethanol,\nsuch as gin and vodka, may cause fewer hangover effects. Meanwhile, the presence of flavoring\ningredients in beverages like whiskey, brandy, and red wine, may make these kinds of alcohol \ncause more hangover symptoms. So, the choice of alcoholic\nbeverage matters, but any of them can cause hangovers,\nsimply because they all contain alcohol. So, do common hangover remedies\nactually work? Drinking water and electrolyte beverages\ncan help reduce symptoms related to dehydration. And eating— especially carbs—\ncan help replenish the glucose levels alcohol reduces. But ultimately, the only sure way \nto prevent a hangover is to drink alcohol in moderation\nor not at all."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the biggest factor leading to the incidence and severity of hangovers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The type of alcohol consumed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The amount of alcohol consumed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The time of day that alcohol is consumed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The mixers added to an alcoholic beverage"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which neural mechanism has not been linked to the development of a hangover?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rebound excitatory activity in nerve cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Activation of the immune system"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dehydration"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Excess sleep "}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Disruption in hormone signaling by alcohol can lead to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fatigue"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dehydration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Headache"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Inflammation of brain cells by alcohol may lead to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Poor memory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hyperactivity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Impaired attention"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Negative mood states"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The most effective way to prevent hangovers is to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Always drink on a full stomach"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only drink beer or wine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only drink clear alcoholic beverages"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 6, "lesson": 15, "title": "The end of Roe v. Wade — and what comes next - Kathryn Kolbert", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-end-of-roe-v-wade-and-what-comes-next-kathryn-kolbert", "transcript": {"en": "\"What's the Supreme Court\ngoing to do about abortion?\" “They’re not really going to overturn\nRoe v. Wade, are they?” \"They can't do that, can they?\" I can't tell you how many people\nhave asked me questions like this in recent months. It makes sense. I have argued two abortion cases\nin the US Supreme Court, including the 1992 case\nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey, which is credited with saving\nRoe v. Wade. I was a co-founder of the Center\nfor Reproductive Rights, and I spent 20 years of my career arguing on behalf of women\nwho needed abortions and other reproductive health care. So my answer is depressing but direct: Roe v. Wade will be dead within the year. The constitutional right to choose\nwhether or not to have an abortion will no longer be protected\nby the United States Constitution. This court is likely\nto overrule Roe and Casey or so undermine its meaning that it will be effectively\nunavailable for use. Now I heard your gasps, I'm going to say it again. The Federal Constitution\nof the United States will no longer protect\nreproductive freedom. Now I'm also here to tell you that there's hope. That we can preserve, by working together, our reproductive freedoms. And by that, I mean more than just\nthe right to choose abortion. By that, I mean the ability to make\ndecisions about becoming parents. All people should have that right. Whatever their race,\nwhatever their gender, whoever they love, all people ought to have the right\nto decide to become parents and the social supports that are necessary to raise those children\nwith dignity and in safety. So opponents argue three things when they say they want to ban abortion. They talk about religion; they talk about protection\nof fetal rights; they talk about protection\nof women's health. So let's take those each in turn. Religion. You know, the reality of the world is that the world's religions have\na wide variety of views on abortion, and many support them in a whole range\nof different circumstances. So when abortion opponents say religion, they're really just imposing\ntheir religion on the rest of us. And what about protection of fetal rights? If in fact you cared\nabout protecting fetal rights, you'd spend a lot of time\nworking to eliminate the alarming rate of infant\nmortality in this country. (Applause) Because in the United States, we have one of the highest rates\nof infant mortality in the developed world. They also should be supporting programs\nfor children once they are born. (Applause) You know, what about the protection\nof women's health? Well, the reality is, abortion is already\nan extremely safe surgical procedure. It is safer than childbirth. And imposing new restrictions on abortion\nonly makes it less safe. In my view, what\nwe're really talking about, this fixation on abortion by opponents, those people who want to ban abortion, is all about controlling women. And women are unable to operate, to be equal participants in our society, if we cannot control whether,\nwhen and with whom we have children. We cannot exercise\nthe fundamental human right to make decisions about our bodies\nand our destinies. So why am I so convinced that the Supreme Court\nis going to overrule Roe and Casey and take what is clearly a radical step? Now, interestingly enough, I learned everything I needed to know\nto be successful in the Supreme Court on “Sesame Street.” (Laughter) Why? Because you've got to learn to count. And the only number\nthat matters is five -- (Laughter) which is a majority\nof the justices on the Court. Now, when Casey went\nto the High Court in 1992, I was convinced that there were\nfive justices then prepared to overrule Roe and return to the states\nthe ability to ban abortion. I was correct. Right after my argument, the justices returned\nto their conference room and took a vote, and seven justices voted to uphold\nthe Pennsylvania restrictions that were at issue in the case. And then Chief Justice Rehnquist\nwrote a draft opinion. While he never said the magic words,\nthat Roe is fatal, as Justice John Paul Stevens recently\nwrote in his memoir, the opinion effectively repudiated\nthe central holding of Roe. Now, luckily, that opinion\nwas never filed in 1992. At the last minute, Justice Anthony\nKennedy changed his mind, and together with justices\nSandra Day O'Connor and David Souter, they issued what they called\na joint opinion. And in it, they upheld the right of women\nto obtain abortion up until viability, usually between 24\nand 28 weeks of pregnancy, in all 50 states and US territories. But the Casey decision\nwent a little further, and it had permitted states\nto enact barriers to abortion as long as they weren't undue\nburdens on women. And as a result, in the following three decades, we’ve seen states pass\nhundreds of restrictions on abortion, and the increasingly conservative\ncourts uphold those restrictions. And as a result, we've seen a dwindling\navailability of abortion. Today, about 11 percent\nof the counties in this country that actually have an abortion provider. There are six states\nthat have one abortion provider. As we know, in the days before Roe, women with means\nwere able to get abortions. Other women, on the other hand, even today -- low-income women,\nwomen who live in rural areas, teenagers, women of color,\nwomen who are disabled -- all of whom have difficulty accessing safe and affordable abortion. Now the question is:\nWhat’s going to happen now? And unfortunately,\nthings are going to get worse. There are currently three cases\npending in the Supreme Court, two from Texas and one from Mississippi. Now, most of you probably\nhave been following the Texas situation. Texas passed a ban on abortion\nat about six weeks of pregnancy. It allowed any individual\nto sue abortion providers. Vigilantes could collect a bounty\nof 10,000 dollars for a violation of the law. And as a result, many, many clinics, probably most of the clinics in Texas, have closed their doors or have decreased the number\nof abortions they performed. It's difficult. But the critical piece about Texas is that five justices -- remember that number five -- five justices already voted to permit\nthe Texas law to go into effect. And besides the harm for women, those justices are not really considering\nthe constitutionality of the act, only who can be sued and where. The more important case\nis out of Mississippi. There, there's a ban on abortion\nat 15 weeks of pregnancy. Arguments were heard this week,\nand in my view, we are likely to see\nat least five justices overrule Roe and Casey and send the question of abortion\nback to the states. Sesame Street, five votes. And unfortunately, this time around, there is no Justice Kennedy to save us. Now, what's going to happen\nwhen Roe and Casey are overturned? I'd guess that about half\nthe states in this country will ban all or most abortions. We're likely to see ban stretching\nfrom Georgia all the way west to Texas, from Idaho, all the way south to Arizona. Women, like Texan women,\nwill be forced to travel to the 15 states that are controlled by pro-choice\nlegislators and governors. Other women will seek medication abortion, using the internet\nor gray or black markets and subject themselves in some states\nto criminal prosecutions. Still, other women will carry\ntheir unintended pregnancies to term. The bottom line is\nthis is not a pretty picture. So what now? What can we do? We have been saying for five decades, \"Save Roe, save Roe, save Roe.\" That strategy is no longer feasible. Give it up. We've got to make sure we quit hitting our heads\nagainst the marble staircase. And try to find new strategies. So I'm going to propose\ntwo of them to you today. First, we’ve got to build\na badass social justice movement. (Applause) Which means loudly crying for our rights, loudly saying: this is something\nthat belongs to us. We know from watching\nthe Black Lives Matter movement and the marriage equality movement\nthat coalition is queen. We've got to find allies and work with them to make sure\nour rights are protected. But equally important, we've got to ensure that we elect -- and I'd actually say more important -- is we've got to elect legislators, throughout the states and in Congress, who are champions for reproductive health. Now, I'm not going to bother\nto tell you all how to get politically active. This is a crowd that knows how to do it. But knowing how to do it\nand actually doing it are two different things, so what you need to do\nis get politically active. But one of the things I will tell you is what would our world look like if we were able to wrest the reins\nof governmental power away from those who oppose abortion and allow an agenda that reflects reproductive\nfreedoms and justice. Picture this. We would have childcare and universal childhood education\nin every community in this country. We would have paid maternity\nand paternity leaves, and people would actually take them. All working parents\nought to have that right. You know -- (Applause) According to the Centers\nfor Disease Control, African American women, Native American women, Alaska Native women are dying of pregnancy-related causes at three times the rate of white women. And most of those deaths are preventable. So in our world where we control\nthe reins of power, we would ensure, we would ensure that there were programs to reduce this alarming rate\nof maternal mortality. And we would make sure that the systemic racism\nin our health care system would be eliminated. And we'd work to eliminate infertility with special programs for women\nwho can't get pregnant. And we would make sure that all women\nare entitled to health care services at all stages of their life. Now all of those things I've talked about, are family-friendly policies and ought to be supported\nby our opponents as well. I'll wait to see if that's the case. But in my world where we control\nthe reins of power, we would do more. The birth control pill\nwould be available over the counter. (Applause) OK, as easy to get as a bottle of Tylenol. And we'd have quality sex education\nin every public school in this country. (Applause) And we would make sure that ... abortion is affordable and available -- no more bans, no more barriers, no more restrictions on funding. And medication abortion, the abortion pill, would be available not just\nat Planned Parenthoods and the dwindling number\nof abortion clinics in this country, but at pharmacies without a prescription, at walk-in health centers and on every college campus\nin the United States. (Applause) And if you had any doubt about the importance\nof getting politically active, we could also pass a constitutional amendment, what I call a gender equity amendment, that would guarantee to all persons the ability to make decisions\nnot just about abortion, but about pregnancy and marriage and sexuality and parenting. And it would be a permanent part\nof the United States Constitution. Now the important part of that is these rights should not\nbe controlled by politicians. They shouldn't be dependent\non where you live or how much money you make or the color of your skin or the person you love or the pronouns you use. These are universal\nfundamental human rights, and they ought to be guaranteed in law, in the Constitution, so the Supreme Court\ncannot willy-nilly take them away. (Applause) Now to do this, we need to elect champions for choice to the 500,000 elected seats\nin our government in this country: everything from school boards\nto town councils, to state legislatures\nto Congress and the White House. All of those seats need to be controlled\nby champions of our cause. And that can only happen\nif you get politically active. Your vote, your willingness\nto work in campaigns, write postcards, make phone calls, knock on doors, can make that happen. And even run for office, because that's what we need to do. Now while dire, the end of Roe\nis not the end of the story. To paraphrase Joan Baez, the best antidote to despair is action. And your action, your willingness to work hard cannot only preserve reproductive\nfreedoms for ourselves but for our children as well. So let's do it. Thank you.

I agree. They'll use that opportunity\nto chop it up with him, and often when they're done\ntalking with him, they’ll mention that they think\nhe’s a smart and engaging little guy. When those people walk away,\nthe thought that comes to my mind is that I hope they remember\nmeeting him as a child when they see him again as a grown man. This thought comes to my mind because I’ve written two books about race\nand racism in the United States, and this kind of work\ncan produce feelings of pessimism. One of the things that I’ve learned is that Americans have\nan orientation toward progress. In this context, what that means is that we often celebrate\nthe distance between where we were and where we are now. But that same orientation can blind us\nfrom the gap between where we are and where we could or should be. The other thing I’ve learned\nabout Americans is that we have a very,\nvery narrow understanding of racism, mostly in the minds and hearts of people, usually old people -- old people from the South. And this really narrow definition\ncan constrain our opportunities to produce a more\nracially egalitarian society. We like to hunt for races and distance ourselves from people who say\nmean things about whole groups of people or who idealize the 1950s. But the fact of the matter is that\nwe might just need to look in the mirror. Now, I'm not saying\nthat everyone here is a racist, but what I am saying\nis that everyone here has the capacity and perhaps even the propensity to live their life in a way, to make decisions, to rely on biases that reproduce racial inequality. Some people say, “Well, you do all this\nwork about racism. What’s the answer?” And I say that the first thing\nwe might need to do is to come to a shared understanding about what racism is in the first place. History shows that racists\nhave had the upper hand in deciding who the racists are\nand what racism is, and it’s never them\nor the things that they do. But maybe if we come together and come to a shared and perhaps a precise\ndefinition of what racism is, we can work toward creating a society where mothers like me aren’t in constant\nfear of their children’s lives. I'd like to dispel\nthree myths about racism on our trek toward mutual understanding. First: it’s true that the South has done\nits work to earn its reputation as the most racist region. But there are other states and regions\nthat are competing for the title. For example, if we look at the most segregated states\nin terms of where Black kids go to school, we'll see, sure, some are in the South. There are some out west, in the Midwest and in the Northeast. They're where we live. Or if we look at states\nwith the biggest racial disparities in terms of prison populations, we see that none of them\nare in the South. They're where we live. My colleague Rebecca Kreitzer and I looked at a standard battery\nof racial attitudes of prejudice, and we found that in the 1990s, states in the South dominated\nthe most racially negative attitudes. But this geography has evolved,\nand things have changed. By 2016, we found\nthat the Dakotas, Nebraska, states in the Midwest, in the Northeast, were competing for the \"most prejudiced\npopulation\" titles. Now, I'm not saying that one state\nis more racist than another, but what I am saying is that every state might have its own\nspecial brand of racism. And it doesn't have to be like this. Most of the inequalities that we see in\nour day-to-day lives happen at the state and local level. What that means is that we don't\nhave to go all the way to Congress to make change in our communities. We can simply hold our city, our county,\nour state legislators to task to produce more equitable outcomes. Myth two: we're not that good\nat hunting for racists. Remember that time when the governor\nof Virginia did blackface, and people were like, \"Oh, that's bad.\nI need to get that racist out of here\"? I was giving y'all the side-eye,\nand here's why. While people were going back to yearbooks to look for things\nthat were obviously racist, fewer people were looking into\nthe current-day policy stances of legislators who probably did\nblackface but didn't get caught. So, how many of us\nmight have supported a candidate who is willing to let neighborhoods\nsecede from their district so that kids could go\nto all-white schools -- in the 21st century? Or how many of us might have\nsupported a ballot measure that systematically reduced\nsome groups' chances of voting? Or how many of us might have focused on\nthe behavior of Black mothers rather than doctors or health care\nsystems and policies when we learn about\nthe huge racial disparities in maternal and infant mortality? It doesn't have to be like this. We could do something different. We could scrutinize the behaviors\nof the rule makers. We could orient ourselves\ntoward a more just society, and on our way there, we can't mystify practical\npolicy solutions. Myth three: If you believe that when all\nthe grandmas in Mississippi die that racism is going to go with them, you are in for a big disappointment. We like to think that young people are going to do the hard work\nof eradicating racism, but there are some things\nthat we should note. We know that young folks, young white\nfolks especially, like diversity, they appreciate it,\nthey're looking for it. But we also know that they don't\nlive diverse lives. Research shows that the average white\nAmerican literally has one black friend. And what that means is that most\ndon't have any at all. Sociologists like Sarah Mayorga show that\neven when well-meaning white folks move to diverse neighborhoods, they don't necessarily have\npositive interactions, no less any with their neighbors\nwho aren't white. My research with Professor\nChristopher DeSante shows that when we ask white millennials\ntheir racial attitudes and policy preferences, that they're sometimes,\njust as in other times, even more racially\nconservative than boomers. When we ask them about the things\nthat are important to them, they don't have\nany particular sense of urgency around questions of racial inequality. How did we get like this? Well, one of the things we might\nthink about is how we raise our kids and equip them to solve the problems\nthat we want them to solve. Research shows that\nwhite parents in particular will either choose to not talk\nabout issues of racism to their kids in order to protect them\nfrom a harsh racial reality or they instill colorblind lessons, and that can actually reinforce\nnegative racial attitudes. So it's kind of like how some of your parents\nmight have given you books about puberty so they didn't have to talk about\nthe birds and the bees, and then you tried to connect all the dots\nand then you did it all wrong. It's like that. It doesn't have to be like this. We can do better. We can have hard\nconversations with our kids so that they don't grow up\nlike many of us did, thinking that talking about racism\nmakes you a racist -- it doesn't -- and so that we can prevent them\nfrom making the same mistakes that we've seen in the past. Remember a long, long time ago in 2008, when we were all pining to live\nin a post-racial world? Well, I say that it's time for us\nto think bigger and dream bigger and think about what it would be like\nto live in a post-racist world. But in order to do that,\nwe'd have to come together to have a shared definition of racism -- not just in the matter\nof hearts and minds, but in systems, policies, rules, decisions made over and over again\nto marginalize some people -- and agree to become anti-racists --\npeople who learn more and do better. So we could ask harder\nquestions of candidates about their stances on racial inequality before we throw\nour full weight behind them. We could buycott or boycott businesses whose practices don't align\nwith our values. We could talk to our kids about racism. We could figure out our state's\nspecial brand of racism and work to eradicate it. People made racial disparities,\nand people can unmake them. And sure, it'll be hard, but the fact of the matter is, someone is depending on us\nto do nothing at all. Thank you.

My name is Aparna. I am a shopaholic -- (Laughter) and I'm addicted to online returns. (Laughter) Well, at least I was. At one time, I had two or three\npackages of clothing delivered to me every other day. I would intentionally buy the same item in a couple different sizes\nand many colors, because I did not know\nwhat I really wanted. So I overordered, I tried things on,\nand then I sent what didn't work back. Once my daughter was watching me\nreturn some of those packages back, and she said, \"Mom,\nI think you have a problem.\" (Laughter) I didn't think so. I mean, it's free shipping\nand free returns, right? (Laughter) I didn't even think twice about it, until I heard a statistic\nat work that shocked me. You see, I'm a global solutions\ndirector for top-tier retail, and we were in a meeting\nwith one of my largest customers, discussing how to streamline costs. One of their biggest concerns\nwas managing returns. Just this past holiday season alone, they had 7.5 million pieces\nof clothing returned to them. I could not stop thinking about it. What happens to all\nthese returned clothes? So I came home and researched. And I learned that every year, four billion pounds of returned clothing\nends up in the landfill. That's like every resident in the US\ndid a load of laundry last night and decided to throw it\nin the trash today. I was horrified. I'm like, \"Of all people, I should be able to help prevent this.\" (Laughter) My job is to find solutions\nto logistical issues like these -- not create them. So this issue became very personal to me. I said, \"You know what?\nWe have to solve this.\" And we can, with some of the existing\nsystems we already have in place. And then I started to wonder:\nHow did we get here? I mean, it was only like six years ago\nwhen a study recommended that offering free online returns\nwould drive customers to spend more. We started seeing companies\noffering free online returns to drive more sales\nand provide a better experience. What we didn't realize is that this would lead to more items\nbeing returned as well. In the US, companies lost\n$351 billion in sales in 2017 alone. Retailers are scrambling\nto recover their losses. They try to place that returned item\nonline to be sold again, or they'll sell it to a discount partner or a liquidator. Basically, if companies cannot find\na place for this item quickly and economically, its place becomes the trash. Suddenly, I felt very guilty\nfor being that shopper, somebody who contributes to this. Who would have thought\nmy innocent shopping behavior would be hurting not only me, but our planet as well? And as I thought about what to do, I kept thinking: Why does the item have to be returned\nto the retailer in the first place? What if there was another way, a win-win for everyone? What if when a person\nis trying to return something, it could go to the next\nshopper who wants it, and not the retailer? What if, instead of a return, they could do what I call a \"green turn\"? Consumers could use an app\nto take pictures of the item and verify the condition\nwhile returning it. Artificial intelligence systems could then\nsort these clothes by condition -- mint condition or slightly used -- and direct it to the next\nappropriate person. Mint-condition clothes could\nautomatically go to the next buyer, while slightly used clothes\ncould be marked down and offered online again. The retailer can decide the business rules on the number of times\na particular item can be resold. All that the consumer would need to do\nis obtain a mobile code, take it to the nearest shipping place\nto be packed and shipped, and off it goes from\none buyer to the next, not the landfill. Now you will ask, \"Would people really\ngo through all this trouble?\" I think they would if they had incentives, like loyalty points or cash back. Let's call it \"green cash.\" There would be a whole\nnew opportunity to make money from this new customer base\nlooking to buy these returns. This system would make\na fun thing like shopping a spiritual experience that helps save our planet. (Applause) This is doable and would probably take six months\nto weave some of our existing systems and run a pilot. Even before any of these\nlogistical systems are in place, each of us shoppers can act now, if every single adult in the US\nmade a few small changes to our shopping behavior. Take the extra time\nto research and think -- Do I really need this item? No: Do I really want this item? -- before making a purchase. And if every one of us adults in the US returned five less items this year, we would keep 240 million pounds\nof clothes out of the landfill. Six percent reduction, just like that. This environmental problem\nthat we have created is not thousands of years away; it's happening today, and must stop now to prevent growing\nlandfills across the globe. I want to leave my daughter\nand my daughter's daughter a better and cleaner place\nthan I found it, so I have not only stopped overordering, I recycle religiously as well. And you can, too. It's not difficult. Before we fill our shopping carts\nand our landfills with extra items that we don't want, let's pause next time\nwe are shopping online and think twice about what we all\nhopefully really do want: a beautiful Earth to call home. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Every year, _______ pounds of returned clothing ends up in the landfill.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "44 million"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4 billion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "78 million"}, {"label": "D", "text": "16 billion"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If every adult in the US returned five less items a year, we would keep _______ pounds of clothes out of the landfill.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "32 million"}, {"label": "B", "text": "612 million"}, {"label": "C", "text": "240 million"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2.4 billion"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Moreman", "category": "Philosophy & Religion", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-dark-history-of-zombies-christopher-m-moreman", "transcript": {"en": "Animated corpses appear\nin stories all over the world throughout recorded history. But zombies have a distinct lineage— one that traces back \nto Equatorial and Central Africa. The first clue is in the word \n“zombie” itself. Its exact etymological origins \nare unknown, but there are several candidates. The Mitsogho people of Gabon, for example,\nuse the word “ndzumbi” for corpse. The Kikongo word “nzambi” refers\nvariously to the supreme being, an ancestor with superhuman abilities,\nor another deity. And, in certain languages spoken\nin Angola and the Congo, “zumbi” refers to an object inhabited \nby a spirit, or someone returned from the dead. There are also similarities\nin certain cultural beliefs. For example, in Kongo tradition, \nit’s thought that once someone dies, their spirit can be housed \nin a physical object which might bring protection \nand good luck. Similar beliefs about what\nmight happen to someone’s soul after death are held \nin various parts of Africa. Between 1517 and 1804, France and Spain enslaved \nhundreds of thousands of African people, taking them to the Caribbean island that now contains Haiti \nand the Dominican Republic. There, the religious beliefs \nof enslaved African people mixed with the Catholic traditions \nof colonial authorities and a religion known as “vodou” developed. According to some vodou beliefs, a \nperson’s soul can be captured and stored, becoming a body-less “zombi.” Alternatively, if a body isn’t properly\nattended to soon after death, a sorcerer called a “bokor”\ncan capture a corpse and turn it into a soulless zombi\nthat will perform their bidding. Historically, these zombis were said \nto be put to work as laborers who needed neither food nor rest \nand would enrich their captor’s fortune. In other words, zombification seemed \nto represent the horrors of enslavement that many Haitian people experienced. It was the worst possible fate: a form of enslavement that not even\ndeath could free you from. The zombi was deprived of an afterlife\nand trapped in eternal subjugation. Because of this, in Haitian culture, zombis are commonly seen as victims\ndeserving of sympathy and care. The zombie underwent a transformation\nafter the US occupation of Haiti began in 1915— this time, through the lens\nof Western pop culture. During the occupation, US citizens\npropagated many racist beliefs about Black Haitian people. Among false accounts\nof devil worship and human sacrifice, zombie stories captured\nthe American imagination. And in 1932, zombies debuted\non the big screen in a film called “White Zombie.” Set in Haiti, the film’s protagonist \nmust rescue his fiancée from an evil vodou master who runs \na sugar mill using zombi labor. Notably, the film's main object of\nsympathy isn't the enslaved workforce, but the victimized white woman. Over the following decades, zombies\nappeared in many American films, usually with loose references\nto Haitian culture, though some veered off to involve\naliens and Nazis. Then came the wildly influential 1968 film\n“Night of the Living Dead,” in which a group of strangers tries \nto survive an onslaught of slow-moving, flesh-eating monsters. The film’s director remarked that he never\nenvisioned his living dead as zombies. Instead, it was the audience who\nrecognized them as such. But from then on, zombies became linked\nto an insatiable craving for flesh— with a particular taste for brains added\nin 1985′s “The Return of the Living Dead.” In these and many subsequent films,\nno sorcerer controls the zombies; they’re the monsters. And in many iterations, \nlater fueled by 2002′s “28 Days Later,” zombification became \na contagious phenomenon. For decades now, artists around the world\nhave used zombies to shine a light on the social ills \nand anxieties of their moment— from consumer culture to the global lack\nof disaster preparedness. But, in effect, American pop culture also\ninitially erased the zombies origins— cannibalizing its original significance and transforming the victim \ninto the monster."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When were many Africans enslaved by Europeans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1000-1400"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1315-1600"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1517-1804"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1500-1776"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the name of the religious tradition that formed through the mixing of African and Catholic beliefs in Haiti?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hoodoo"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Vodou"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Santeria"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Christianity"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What did zombification remind Haitians of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mortality"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Brains"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Horror"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Slavery"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When did the US occupation of Haiti begin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1778"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1804"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1915"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1968"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What movie introduced the idea that zombies eat brains?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Return of the Living Dead"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Night of the Living Dead"}, {"label": "C", "text": "King of the Zombies"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Plan 9 from Outer Space"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Two men arrived at Lili’uokalani’s door,\narrested her, and led her to the room\nwhere she would be imprisoned. A group had recently seized power\nand now confiscated her diaries, ransacked her house, \nclaimed her lands, and hid her away. Lili’uokalani was Hawaii’s queen. And she ruled through one of the most\nturbulent periods of its history. 75 years earlier, American missionaries\nfirst arrived in Hawaii. They quickly amassed power,\nbuilding businesses and claiming arable land \nthat they transformed into plantations. They worked closely with the ali’i, or sacred Hawaiian nobility \nclosely linked to the Gods. The ali’i appointed missionaries \nto government roles where they helped establish Hawaii \nas a sovereign kingdom with a constitutional monarchy. But once certain business \nopportunities emerged— namely, the prospect of exporting sugar\nto the US tariff-free— some of their descendants\nshifted positions. They formed a political group \nknown as “the Missionary Party” and began plotting to annex Hawaii,\nbringing it under US control. Lili’uokalani and her siblings were born\ninto an ali’i family. In 1874, her brother, Kalākaua, \nascended the throne, but thirteen years into his reign,\nthe emerging threat crystallized. The Missionary Party called a meeting\nwhere an all-white militia surrounded and forced the king \nto sign new legislation. Later called the Bayonet Constitution, it stripped Native Hawaiians \nof their rights, diminished the monarchy’s power, and ceded control to this group\nof white businessmen. Four years later, King Kalākaua died, heartbroken, Lili’uokalani said, “by the base ingratitude of the very \npersons whose fortunes he had made.” Prepared to fight, she assumed the throne. Despite death threats \nand rumors of insurgency, Queen Lili’uokalani was determined\nto restore power to her people— an estimated two thirds of whom \nhad lost their voting rights. Flooded with requests for change, \nshe authored a new constitution. But before she introduced it, \nthe so-called “Committee of Safety,” a new organization that consisted \nof many Missionary Party members, hatched another plot. Under the false pretense \nthat this new constitution endangered American property and lives, they staged a coup on January 17th, 1893. More than 160 US Marines\nmarched to the palace, where the “Committee of Safety” \nremoved Queen Lili’uokalani from office. Thousands of Hawaiian people protested, some wearing hat bands reading, \n“Aloha ’Āina,” or “love of the nation.” The alleged “Provisional Government”\ndeclared Hawaii a Republic the following year. They proclaimed \nthat Hawaiians couldn’t vote or be government employees without signing\na new “oath of allegiance.” Many refused. The following year, \nsome of Lili’uokalani’s supporters attempted a counterrevolution. The Republic responded brutally, jailing hundreds\nand sentencing six people to death. In exchange for their release, the Republic made Lili’uokalani \nsign a document that claimed to relinquish her throne,\nand they imprisoned her in the palace. Under constant guard, she composed songs \nexpressing her love for her people and began making a patchwork quilt\nthat told the story of her life. While she was only allowed news\nthat had been reviewed by her jailers, her supporters often brought her bouquets\nfrom the garden she’d dedicated to them, wrapped in newspaper. After 8 months, Lili’uokalani was placed \nunder house arrest. As soon as it was lifted, she traveled\nto Washington, D.C. with Hawaiian nationalists\nand over 20,000 signatures. There they successfully convinced Congress\nto halt the Republic’s annexation treaty. But the following year, \nthe Spanish-American War began. Seeing Hawaii \nas a strategic military base, President William McKinley declared \nit a US territory on July 7th, 1898— breaking international law and devastating\nQueen Lili’uokalani and her people. She spent the rest of her life petitioning\nfor the restoration of her lands, Native Hawaiian rights, \nand national liberation. When she died in 1917, \nthese dreams were unrealized. A member of the group that forced \nQueen Lili’uokalani out of office once declared, “If we are ever to have \npeace and annexation the first thing to do \nis obliterate the past.” They failed at this goal. Queen Lili’uokalani left\na resilient legacy: Her commitment to her land and people\nnever wavered and many Hawaiians continue to fight\nin her memory. Speaking of Hawaii’s children,\nQueen Lili’uokalani said, “It is for them that I would give\nthe last drop of my blood.”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Queen Liliʻuokalani ascended the throne after the death of her brother.

In fact, I would argue\nthat some of the most interesting things of the human experience\noccur at the intersections, in the liminal space, where by liminal\nI mean the space in-between. There's freedom in that in-between, freedom to create from the indefiniteness\nof not-quite-here, not-quite-there, a new self-definition. Some of the great intersections\nof the world come to mind, like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, or Times Square in New York City, both bustling with the excitement\nof a seemingly endless stream of people. Other intersections, like the Edmund Pettus Bridge\nin Selma, Alabama, or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court\nin Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind because of the tremendous energy\nat the intersection of human beings, ideologies and the ongoing\nstruggle for justice. Beyond the physical\nlandscape of our planet, some of the most famous celestial images\nare of intersections. Stars are born at the messy\nintersection of gas and dust, instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull. Stars die by this same intersection,\nthis time flung outward in a violent collision of smaller atoms, intersecting and efficiently fusing\ninto altogether new and heavier things. We can all think of intersections\nthat have special meaning to us. To be intersectional, then, is to occupy a position\nat an intersection. I've lived the entirety of my life\nin the in-between, in the liminal space\nbetween dreams and reality, race and gender, poverty and plenty, science and society. I am both black and a woman. Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies, this robust combination of knowing\nresults in a shining example of the explosive fusion of identities. I am also an astrophysicist. I study blazars, supermassive,\nhyperactive black holes that sit at the centers\nof massive galaxies and shoot out jets\nnearby those black holes at speeds approaching the speed of light in a process we are still trying\nto completely understand. I have dreamed\nof becoming an astrophysicist since I was 12 years old. I had no idea that at that time, according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive\nof African-American women in physics, only 18 black women in the United States\nhad ever earned a PhD in a physics-related discipline, and that the first black woman to graduate\nwith a PhD in an astronomy-related field did so just one year before my birth. As I journeyed along my path, I encountered the best and worst\nof life at an intersection: the tremendous opportunity to self-define, the collision of expectation\nand experience, the exhilaration\nof victorious breakthroughs and, sometimes, the explosive pain of regeneration. I began my college experience\njust after my family had fallen apart. Our financial situation disintegrated just after my father's\ndeparture from our lives. This thrust my mother, my sister and I out of the relative comfort\nof middle-class life and into the almost constant struggle\nto make ends meet. Thus, I was one of roughly\n60 percent of women of color who find finances to be a major barrier\nto their educational goals. Thankfully, Norfolk State University\nprovided me with full funding, and I was able to achieve\nmy bachelor's in physics. After graduation, and despite knowing\nthat I wanted a PhD in astrophysics, I fell through the cracks. It was a poster that saved my dream, and some really incredible\npeople and programs. The American Physical Society\nhad this beautiful poster encouraging students of color\nto become physicists. It was striking to me\nbecause it featured a young black girl, probably around 12 years old, looking studiously\nat some physics equations. I remember thinking I was looking directly back\nat the little girl who first dared to dream this dream. I immediately wrote to the Society and requested my personal\ncopy of the poster, which to this day\nstill hangs in my office. I described to them in the email\nmy educational path, and my desire to find myself again\nin pursuit of the PhD. They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt\nUniversity Bridge Program, itself an intersection\nof the master's and PhD degrees at two institutions. After two years out of school,\nthey accepted me into the program, and I found myself again\non the path to the PhD. After receiving my master's at Fisk, I went on to Yale to complete my PhD. Once I was physically occupying\nthe space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations, I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD. (Laughter) It became immediately apparent that not everyone was thrilled\nto have that degree of liminality in their space. I was ostracized by many of my classmates, one of whom went so far as to invite me\nto \"do what I really came here to do\" as he pushed all the dirty dishes\nfrom our meal in front of me to clean up. I wish that were an isolated occurrence, but for many women of color in science, technology, engineering,\nand mathematics, or STEM, this is something they have long endured. One hundred percent\nof the 60 women of color interviewed in a recent study\nby Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings reported facing racialized gender bias, including being mistaken\nfor the janitorial staff. This mistaken identity was not reported by any of the white women\ninterviewed for this study, which comprised 557 women in total. While there is nothing inherently wrong\nwith a janitorial position, and in fact my forefathers and foremothers\nwere able to attend college because many of their parents\nworked these jobs, it was a clear attempt\nto put me in my place. While there was certainly\nthe acute pain of the encounter, the real issue is that my appearance can tell anyone anything about my ability. Beyond that, though, it underscores that the women of color in STEM\ndo not experience the same set of barriers that just women\nor just people of color face. That's why today I want to highlight\nwomen of color in STEM, who are inexorably, unapologetically living as the inseparable\nsum of identities. STEM itself is an intersectional term, such that its true richness\ncannot be appreciated without considering\nthe liminal space between disciplines. Science, the pursuit\nof understanding the physical world by way of chemistry, physics, biology, cannot be accomplished\nin the absence of mathematics. Engineering requires the application\nof basic science and math to the lived experience. Technology sits firmly\non the foundation of math, engineering and science. Math itself serves\nthe critical role of Rosetta Stone, decoding and encoding\nthe physical principles of the world. STEM is utterly incomplete\nwithout each individual piece. This is to say nothing\nof the enrichment that is realized when STEM is combined\nwith other disciplines. The purpose for this talk is twofold: first, to say directly to every black,\nLatina, indigenous, First Nation or any other woman or girl who finds herself resting\nat the blessed intersection of race and gender, that you can be anything you want to be. My personal hope is\nthat you'll become an astrophysicist, but beyond that, anything you want. Do not think for one minute that because you are who you are, you cannot be\nwho you imagine yourself to be. Hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you\ninto a world you can't even imagine. Secondly, among the most\npressing issues of our time, most now find\ntheir intersection with STEM. We have as a global society solved most of the single-faceted\nissues of our time. Those that remain\nrequire a thorough investigation of the liminal space between disciplines to create the multifaceted\nsolutions of tomorrow. Who better to solve these liminal problems than those who have faced\ntheir whole lives at the intersections. We as thought leaders and decision makers must push past\nthe first steps of diversity and into the richer\nand more robust territory of full inclusion and equal opportunity. One of my favorite examples\nof liminal excellence comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander, a black woman plasma physicist, who passed away this past July\nafter a 10-year bout with breast cancer. She was a NASA project scientist\nwho spearheaded the NASA side of the Rosetta mission, which became famous this year\nfor landing a rover on a comet, and the 1.5 billion dollar\nGalileo mission to Jupiter, two high-profile scientific victories for NASA, the United States\nand the world. Dr. Alexander said it this way: \"I'm used to walking between two cultures. For me, it's among the purposes of my life to take us from states of ignorance\nto states of understanding with bold exploration\nthat you can't do every day.\" This shows exactly\nthe power of a liminal person. She had the technical ability to spearhead some of the most ambitious\nspace missions of our time, and she perfectly understood her place of being exactly who she was\nin any place she was. Jessica Matthews, inventor\nof the SOCCKET line of sports products, like soccer balls, that generate\nrenewable energy as you play with them, said it this way: \"A major part of invention\nisn't just creating things, it's understanding people and understanding the systems\nthat make this world.\" The reason I tell my story and the story of Dr. Alexander\nand Jessica Matthews is because they are fundamentally\nintersectional stories, the stories of lives lived at the nexus\nof race, gender and innovation. Despite implicit and explicit questions\nof my right to be in an elite space, I'm proud to report that when I graduated, I was the first black woman\nto earn a PhD in astrophysics in Yale's then 312-year history. (Applause) I am now part of a small but growing cadre\nof women of color in STEM who are poised to bring new perspectives\nand new ideas to life on the most pressing issues of our time: things like educational inequities, police brutality, HIV/AIDS,\nclimate change, genetic editing, artificial intelligence\nand Mars exploration. This is to say nothing of the things\nwe haven't even thought of yet. Women of color in STEM\noccupy some of the toughest and most exciting sociotechnological\nissues of our time. Thus, we are uniquely positioned to contribute to\nand drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive\nof a wider variety of lived experience. This outlook can be expanded\nto the many intersectional people whose experiences, positive and negative, enrich the conversations\nin ways that outmatch even the best-resourced homogenous groups. This is not a request\nborn out of a desire to fit in. It's a reminder that we cannot get\nto the best possible outcomes for the totality of humanity without precisely this collaboration, this bringing together of the liminal, the differently lived,\ndistinctly experienced and disparately impacted. Simply put, we cannot be\nthe most excellent expression of our collective genius without the full measure\nof humanity brought to bear. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Here. “It’s 1819. As the United States Congress prepares \nto make Missouri the 24th state in the Union, Representative James Tallmage Jr. \ndelivers a speech. He says slavery is morally wrong, calling it an ‘abomination’\nand a ‘monstrous scourge.’ He insists that ‘the extension \nof the evil must now be prevented,’ and that slavery shouldn’t be allowed \nin Missouri, or any new state.” Obviously. “Representative Tyler disagrees. He believes it is a state’s right \nto choose whether or not to allow slavery. He doesn’t think the federal government\ncan prohibit slavery in any newly added states.” Whaaaaat? “Senator Thomas proposes\nwhat he sees as a compromise: Missouri will join the union along\nwith another state, Maine. Slavery will be allowed in Missouri\nand prohibited in Maine. He also suggests drawing a line \nthrough territories yet to become states: slavery will be prohibited north \nof the line, and allowed south of it.” And this is where I have\nto draw the line. That’s better. Now, senators, congressmen, this Missouri compromise you are proposing\nis fundamentally flawed— flawed is putting it mildly. The compromise is based \non the middle ground fallacy. By saying that half of the new territories\nshould allow slavery while half prohibit it, you position the two viewpoints,\npro-slavery and anti-slavery, as equally valid. But if one view is wrong,\nwhile the other is right, a compromise between them is still wrong. And one side is definitely wrong here:\nthe pro-slavery side. The whole reason this government exists, the whole reason states exist at all, \nis to serve the people. That should include all people. Now, I know there are those \namong you who would argue otherwise, even among those in favor\nof ending slavery. In response to your many contorted\narguments, all of them wrong, I offer this reminder: the idea that slavery \nis morally indefensible is not new to you. The founders of your country knew it\nand many even acknowledged it publicly, even those of them who enslaved\nother people themselves. It’s clear that the errors and delusions\non this subject go far beyond the middle ground fallacy, but I call your attention \nto this particular fallacy because it can have dire consequences\nin many situations. Failure to recognize the fact \nthat a compromise between two positions, one of which is morally indefensible,\nis also morally indefensible, has helped to perpetuate countless\ninjustices large and small. Even well-intentioned people—\nwhich rest assured, I don’t mistake you for—\nfall prey to this fallacy, because you humans tend to view compromise\nas a virtue unto itself. “It’s March 1861. Seven states have seceded from the Union since Abraham Lincoln \nwas elected president. As Lincoln takes office with four more\nstates threatening to leave, he promises not to interfere with slavery\nin states where it exists, but to prohibit its expansion \ninto new territories and states.” “It’s April 1861, and a Civil War\nhas broken out over slavery.” Some things can't be resolved\nwith a compromise."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The addition of a slave state with a free state in the mid-1800s is an example of what kind of logical fallacy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Appeal to Popular Opinion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Correlation Implies Causation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Middle Ground"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Slippery Slope"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which legislation ultimately led to dividing the expanding United States into two regions based on slavery?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The 13th amendment of the United States Constitution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The American Civil War"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Emancipation Proclamation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Missouri Compromise of 1820"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why was the Missouri Compromise fundamentally flawed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The compromise was based on the middle ground fallacy."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The legislators assumed that the two viewpoints, pro-slavery and anti-slavery, were equally valid."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The United States was founded on self-evident truths that all men are created equal with the same unalienable rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which important document does the demon quote in his anti-slavery argument to the senators and congressmen?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The 13th amendment of the United States Constitution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Declaration of Independence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Emancipation Proclamation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Gettysburg Address"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In 1865, the United States government passed which amendment to the Constitution to end slavery?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "13th amendment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "12th amendment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2nd amendment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1st amendment"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 6, "lesson": 22, "title": "4 lessons in creativity - Julie Burstein", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/4-lessons-in-creativity-julie-burstein", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Joseph Geni\nReviewer: Morton Bast On my desk in my office, I keep a small clay pot that I made in college. It's raku, which is a kind of pottery that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony. This one is more than 400 years old. Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay, and it was the imperfections that people cherished. Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire. I just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself takes another day or two to cool down, but raku is really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln up to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees, and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside, you can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off, and you reach in with these long metal tongs, you grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea, and you can imagine what that steam would smell like. But here in the United States, we ramp up the drama a little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust, which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail, and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out. I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke. I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements. I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze, but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke, and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen, like this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful on these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees to room temperature in the space of just a minute. Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity. I find in so many things that tension between what I can control and what I have to let go happens all the time, whether I'm creating a new radio show or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons. When I sat down to write a book about creativity, I realized that the steps were reversed. I had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists and writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened to these stories, I realized that creativity grows out of everyday experiences more often than you might think, including letting go. It was supposed to break, but that's okay. (Laughter) (Laughs) That's part of the letting go, is sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't, because creativity also grows from the broken places. The best way to learn about anything is through stories, and so I want to tell you a story about work and play and about four aspects of life that we need to embrace in order for our own creativity to flourish. The first embrace is something that we think, \"Oh, this is very easy,\" but it's actually getting harder, and that's paying attention to the world around us. So many artists speak about needing to be open, to embrace experience, and that's hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that takes all of your focus. The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar, and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town. Mira Nair: In this little town, there were like 2,000 temples. We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me, that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually, was traveling folk theater that would come through the town and I would go off and see these great battles of good and evil by two people in a school field with no props but with a lot of, you know, passion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing. You know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana, the two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of in India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater, I knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform. Julie Burstein: Isn't that a wonderful story? You can see the sort of break in the everyday. There they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil, and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl with thousands of other people watching this performance, but she was ready. She was ready to open up to what it sparked in her, and it led her, as she said, down this path to become an award-winning filmmaker. So being open for that experience that might change you is the first thing we need to embrace. Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult. The novelist Richard Ford speaks about a childhood challenge that continues to be something he wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic. Richard Ford: I was slow to learn to read, went all the way through school not really reading more than the minimum, and still to this day can't read silently much faster than I can read aloud, but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me because when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow I was going to have to do it, then I think I came very slowly into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language and of sentences that are not just the cognitive aspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words, what words look like, where paragraphs break, where lines break. I mean, I wasn't so badly dyslexic that I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it really slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentences as I had to linger, I fell heir to language's other qualities, which I think has helped me write sentences. JB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize, says that dyslexia helped him write sentences. He had to embrace this challenge, and I use that word intentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia. He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music in language. Artists also speak about how pushing up against the limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing into what they can't do, helps them focus on finding their own voice. The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how, as a young artist, he thought he was a painter, and he lived in Florence after graduate school. While he was there, he traveled to Madrid, where he went to the Prado to see this picture by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez. It's from 1656, and it's called \"Las Meninas,\" and it's the picture of a little princess and her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over that little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror, and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen of Spain, who would be standing where you might stand to look at the picture. As he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too. He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand and his palette in the other. Richard Serra: I was standing there looking at it, and I realized that Velázquez was looking at me, and I thought, \"Oh. I'm the subject of the painting.\" And I thought, \"I'm not going to be able to do that painting.\" I was to the point where I was using a stopwatch and painting squares out of randomness, and I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped all my paintings in the Arno, and I thought, I'm going to just start playing around. JB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you might have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy who'd been dead for 300 years, and realized, \"I can't do that,\" and so Richard Serra went back to his studio in Florence, picked up all of his work up to that point, and threw it in a river. Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment, but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City, and he put together a list of verbs — to roll, to crease, to fold — more than a hundred of them, and as he said, he just started playing around. He did these things to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing to rubber, and when he got to the direction \"to lift,\" he created this, which is in the Museum of Modern Art. Richard Serra had to let go of painting in order to embark on this playful exploration that led him to the work that he's known for today: huge curves of steel that require our time and motion to experience. In sculpture, Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting. He makes us the subject of his art. So experience and challenge and limitations are all things we need to embrace for creativity to flourish. There's a fourth embrace, and it's the hardest. It's the embrace of loss, the oldest and most constant of human experiences. In order to create, we have to stand in that space between what we see in the world and what we hope for, looking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak, at war, at death. That's a tough space to stand in. The educator Parker Palmer calls it \"the tragic gap,\" tragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable, and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say, \"You can hold that tension like a violin string and make something beautiful.\" That tension resonates in the work of the photographer Joel Meyerowitz, who at the beginning of his career was known for his street photography, for capturing a moment on the street, and also for his beautiful photographs of landscapes -- of Tuscany, of Cape Cod, of light. Joel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years was in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown to the World Trade Center, and he photographed those buildings in every sort of light. You know where this story goes. On 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town, but he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site of the destruction. Joel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby, I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers and Greenwich, and all I could see was the smoke and a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camera to take a peek, just to see if there was something to see, and some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder, and said, \"Hey, no pictures!\" And it was such a blow that it woke me up, in the way that it was meant to be, I guess. And when I asked her why no pictures, she said, \"It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed.\" And I asked her, \"What would happen if I was a member of the press?\" And she told me, \"Oh, look back there,\" and back a block was the press corps tied up in a little penned-in area, and I said, \"Well, when do they go in?\" and she said, \"Probably never.\" And as I walked away from that, I had this crystallization, probably from the blow, because it was an insult in a way. I thought, \"Oh, if there's no pictures, then there'll be no record. We need a record.\" And I thought, \"I'm gonna make that record. I'll find a way to get in, because I don't want to see this history disappear.\" JB: He did. He pulled in every favor he could, and got a pass into the World Trade Center site, where he photographed for nine months almost every day. Looking at these photographs today brings back the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes when I went home to my family at night. My office was just a few blocks away. But some of these photographs are beautiful, and we wondered, was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz to make such beauty out of such devastation? JM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful and tragic and horrific and everything, but it was also as, in nature, an enormous event that was transformed after the fact into this residue, and like many other ruins — you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace — and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather. I mean, there were afternoons I was down there, and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air and you're standing in the rubble, and I found myself recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature, as time, is erasing this wound. Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event. It gets further and further away from the day, and light and seasons temper it in some way, and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist. The reality is, there's the Woolworth Building in a veil of smoke from the site, but it's now like a scrim across a theater, and it's turning pink, you know, and down below there are hoses spraying, and the lights have come on for the evening, and the water is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on, and I'm thinking, \"My God, who could dream this up?\" But the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that, you have to take a picture. JB: You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency, of the need to get to work, is so powerful in Joel's story. When I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently, I told him how much I admired his passionate obstinacy, his determination to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work, and he laughed, and he said, \"I'm stubborn, but I think what's more important is my passionate optimism.\" The first time I told these stories, a man in the audience raised his hand and said, \"All these artists talk about their work, not their art, which has got me thinking about my work and where the creativity is there, and I'm not an artist.\" He's right. We all wrestle with experience and challenge, limits and loss. Creativity is essential to all of us, whether we're scientists or teachers, parents or entrepreneurs. I want to leave you with another image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one is at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C. It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it. But as you can also see, this one did break at some point in its hundred years. But the person who put it back together, instead of hiding the cracks, decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it. This bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken, than it was when it was first made, and we can look at those cracks, because they tell the story that we all live, of the cycle of creation and destruction, of control and letting go, of picking up the pieces and making something new. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 6, "lesson": 23, "title": "An ode to envy - Parul Sehgal", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/an-ode-to-envy-parul-sehgal", "transcript": {"en": "So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impressive, as the new girl always seems to be. She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case, super strong on state capitals, just a great speller. And I just curdled with jealousy that year, until I hatched my devious plan. So one day I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom. When the coast was clear, I emerged, crept into the classroom, and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. And then I did it. I fiddled with my rival's grades, just a little, just demoted some of those A's. All of those A's. (Laughter) And I got ready to return the book to the drawer, when hang on, some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. So, in a frenzy, I corrected everybody's marks, not imaginatively. I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's, just because I was there, you know, might as well. And I am still baffled by my behavior. I don't understand where the idea came from. I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. I felt great. I don't understand why I was never caught. I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious. I was never caught. But most of all, I am baffled by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at spelling? Jealousy baffles me. It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive. We know babies suffer from jealousy. We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone. We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. And yet, I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. For that, we have to go to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy, would we even have literature? Well no faithless Helen, no \"Odyssey.\" No jealous king, no \"Arabian Nights.\" No Shakespeare. There goes high school reading lists, because we're losing \"Sound and the Fury,\" we're losing \"Gatsby,\" \"Sun Also Rises,\" we're losing \"Madame Bovary,\" \"Anna K.\" No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean, I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything, but in the case of jealousy, he kind of does. This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, \"In Search of Lost Time,\" and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have. (Laughter) And we think about Proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right? We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. We forget how harsh his vision was. We forget how pitiless he is. I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut. I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable. Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust. Is it something as obvious as that jealousy, which boils down into person, desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation? I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story. We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. As the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. Right? Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something Proust understood. In the first volume, Swann's Way, the series of books, Swann, one of the main characters, is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences, and these are Proustian sentences, so they're long as rivers, but in the course of a few sentences, he suddenly recoils and he realizes, \"Hang on, everything I love about this woman, somebody else would love about this woman. Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure, maybe right about now.\" And this is the story he starts to tell himself, and from then on, Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress, he adds to his \"collection of instruments in his private torture chamber.\" Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit, were notoriously jealous. You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right? Jealousy is exhausting. It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed. And what does jealousy like? Jealousy likes information. Jealousy likes details. Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case. Jealousy likes photos. That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter) Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. When Swann is in his jealous throes, and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants, he defends these behaviors. He says, \"You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant, but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument.\" He says, \"They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value.\" Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better. Grief, humiliation, loss: These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust. He says, \"A woman whom we need, who makes us suffer, elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us.\" Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women? No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way? Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement? Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity? Freud would write about this later. One day, Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy, because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. Because she's blameless; everybody knows it. The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing, unintentional behaviors. Is she smiling too brightly here, or did she accidentally brush up against a man there? [Freud] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious. The novel is very good on this point. The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy. And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news. A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself for a year. For a year. A year. And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, and I have to confess when I heard this, I just reacted with admiration. (Laughter) Because, I mean, let's be real. What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right? This is something from a novel. This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel. Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters. She's the author of \"Strangers on a Train\" and \"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\" books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character. Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had, and you're under the floorboards, he's answering to your name, he's wearing your rings, emptying your bank account. That's one way to go. But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route. I can't give the world D's, as much as I would really like to, some days. And it's a pity, because we live in envious times. We live in jealous times. I mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we, where the currency is envy? Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure. So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possession of a mystery. Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. When people think of Holmes, they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty, right, this criminal mastermind. But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade, who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately, needs Holmes' genius, but resents him. Oh, it's so familiar to me. So Lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in \"The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,\" once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution, Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says, \"We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes. We're proud of you.\" And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand. It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right? It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion. You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. The next minute they're on the same side. Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. Could it be so simple though? What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another? Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. We could align ourselves with it. But I like contingency plans. So while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. Fiction alone demystifies jealousy. Fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table. And look who it gathers: sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley, crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself. We are in excellent company. Thank you.

The results surfaced several\nnegative stereotypes, labeling Black students\nas aggressive and stubborn, white students as selfish\nand materialistic, and Asian students as shy and meek. But regardless of the teachers’\nother biases, the most commonly held opinion\nwas that Asian students were significantly more industrious,\nintelligent, and gentle than their peers. On the surface, this might seem\nlike a good thing, or at least better than other,\nnegative characterizations. But treating this seemingly favorable\nstereotype as reality can actually cause a surprising amount\nof harm— to those it describes, those it doesn’t,\nand even those who believe it to be true. This image of humble, hard-working Asians\nis actually well-known as the “model minority” stereotype. Versions of this stereotype emerged\nin the mid-20th century to describe Chinese Americans. But following World War II, the label became commonly used\nto claim that Japanese Americans had overcome their mistreatment\nin US incarceration camps, and successfully integrated\ninto American society. Former incarcerees were praised\nas compliant, diligent, and respectful of authority. In the following decades,\n“model minority” became a label for many Asian populations in the US. But the truth behind this story\nof thriving Asian Americans is much more complicated. During World War II, the US government tried to “Americanize”\nincarcerated Japanese Americans. They did this through English language\nclasses, patriotic exercises, and lessons on how to behave\nin white American society. When incarcerees were released, they were instructed to avoid\nreturning to their own communities and cultural practices, and instead, integrate into white society. But after decades of anti-Asian policies\nand propaganda, white Americans had to be persuaded\nthat Japanese Americans were no longer a threat. So the government organized media coverage\nto transform the public perception of Japanese Americans from suspected\ntraitors to an American success story. In fact, the phrase “model minority” was\ncoined by one such article from 1966. But this article, and others like it, didn’t just cast Asian Americans as an\nobedient and respectful “model minority.\" They also criticized so-called \n“problem minorities,” primarily Black Americans. Politicians who were threatened\nby the rising Civil Rights movement used this rhetoric to discredit\nBlack Americans’ demands for justice and equality. They presented a fabricated story\nof Asian American success to paint struggling Black communities\nas inferior. This narrative put a wedge\nbetween Black and Asian Americans. It erased their shared history\nof fighting oppression alongside other marginalized groups, and pit the two communities\nagainst each other. In doing so, the model minority myth\nalso enforced a racial hierarchy, with white Americans on top\nand everyone else underneath. Certainly, many people who still believe\nthe model minority stereotype, either consciously or unconsciously,\nmight not agree with that idea. But comparing the imagined strengths\nand weaknesses of racial groups places value on how well those groups\nmeet certain standards— typically, standards set\nby a white majority. In this case,\nthe model minority stereotype suggests that marginalized groups\nwho are compliant, gentle, and respectful of white authority are deserving\nof tolerance, while groups that challenge\nthe status quo are not. This stereotype also negatively impacts\nthe Asian individuals it describes. According to a psychological phenomenon\nknown as stereotype threat, members of a group often place pressure\non their individual actions to avoid encouraging negative\ngroup stereotypes. But this phenomenon can occur around\nseemingly positive stereotypes as well. The pressure associated with living\nup to impossibly high standards can lead to poor performance. And teachers are less likely to notice\nwhen Asian students are struggling. Outside the classroom, social programs\ncatering to Asian communities are frequently overlooked or cut, because they’re assumed to need less\nsupport than other disadvantaged groups. The favorable portrait created\nby this stereotype can also make it harder to recognize\nracially motivated violence and discrimination against\nAsian Americans. And since this stereotype carelessly\ngroups all Asians under the same umbrella, it impacts people with various backgrounds\nand unique histories of discrimination. So while the model minority label\nmight appear to benefit Asian populations at first, in practice, it works\nlike every other racial stereotype. It reduces a group of people\nto a one-dimensional image. And that single image hinders our ability\nto understand the history, struggles, and triumphs of the individuals\nwithin that group. Acknowledging and challenging these labels\nis essential for building coalitions across communities and eliminating\nharmful stereotypes for good."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "According to the dictionary, a stereotype is “a fixed, over-generalized belief about a particular group or class of people.” Which of the following is true?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stereotypes are always negative."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stereotypes can be positive or negative."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stereotypes contain a grain of truth."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Stereotypes can only be applied to groups, not to individuals."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to this video, which is not a stereotype of Asian students?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Industrious"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gentle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stubborn"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Meek"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When did the “model minority” stereotype emerge?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In the mid 20th century to describe Chinese Americans"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Following World War II to describe Japanese Americans"}, {"label": "C", "text": "From a magazine article in 1966"}, {"label": "D", "text": "On the basis of high math and science test scores for Asian students in the 1970s"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is a problem with the model minority stereotype?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It pits Asian Americans against other people of color."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It makes other people of color look bad or inferior."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It reinforces a racial hierarchy."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is “stereotype threat”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When members of one group threaten another group."}, {"label": "B", "text": "When one type of stereotype threatens to overturn another stereotype"}, {"label": "C", "text": "When members of a group place pressure on themselves to live up to a stereotype"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Racially motivated violence and discrimination against Asian Americans", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Has a long history in the United States"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Began with the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Is a recent phenomenon related to the labeling of COVID-19 as the “Chinese Virus.”"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Is well-documented and tracked by the FBI and other law enforcement agencies."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
