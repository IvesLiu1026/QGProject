Across the Mediterranean, \nthe ancient Minoans likely found ways to use \nthe same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations \nwere on to something— opium, \nan extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure \nand reduce pain. Though opium has remained \nin use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century \nthat one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified \nand isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances \nmade directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies \ncreated a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, \noxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds \nare collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, \nopioid drugs are very effective painkillers,\nbut they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began \nto market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying \ntheir addictive potential to both the medical community \nand the public. The number of opioid painkillers \nprescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, \nbeginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids \nare so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect \nthe human body from the first dose, through repeated use, \nto what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs \nhas slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by\nbinding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals \nby binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind \nmuch more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more \nsevere pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything\nfrom mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, \nopioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects \nare more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s \nnatural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, \nit triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure \nand may be responsible for the sense of euphoria \nthat characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress \nthe release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, \ndigestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline\nenough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart\nand breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness \nand even death. Over time, the body starts \nto develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number \nof opioid receptors, or the receptors may become \nless responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine\nand resulting mood effects as before, people have to take \nlarger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence \nand addiction. As people take more opioids \nto compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels \nbecome lower and lower, to a point that could impact \nbasic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing \nits number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts \nof noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity \nto noradrenaline allows the body \nto continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids \nto maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent \non opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase \nwithin a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer \nto get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors \nit made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive \nto noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes \nwithdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, \nfever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal \ncan be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal \ncan be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids \naren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, \nbut rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs \nwhile in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care \nof them during withdrawal. If someone goes back \nto using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk \nfor overdose, because what would have been a standard \ndose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths \nfrom opioid overdose have grown exponentially \nin the United States, and opioid addictions have \nalso exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions \nare becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction \nare still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction \nwere middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers \nthey had been prescribed, or received from friends \nand family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced \nto prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit \nsynthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation \nof opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing \nrates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently \nour best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors \nbut doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids \nfrom binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors \nto reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction \nis rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence \nare also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient \nand outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, \nand psychotherapy. But many of these programs \nare very expensive, and the more affordable options \ncan have long waiting lists. They also often require complete \ndetoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common \nmonths-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk \nlosing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim \nto address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse \nusing a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms \nwith drugs that bind to opioid receptors \nbut don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, \nand other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance \ndrugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver \nto prescribe them— even though no specific training \nor certification is required to prescribe \nopioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even \na growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go \nwith combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources \nfor making sense of the treatment options.

{"page": 13, "lesson": 10, "title": "Which is better: Soap or hand sanitizer? - Alex Rosenthal and Pall Thordarson", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/which-is-better-soap-or-hand-sanitizer-alex-rosenthal-and-pall-thordarson", "transcript": {"en": "Your hands, up close, \nare anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places \nfor a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, \nthe virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple \nways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective\nouter surface is made of a lipid bilayer. These lipids are pin shaped molecules \nwhose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it. So in water-rich environments, \nlipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside \nand the tails inside. Their shared reaction to water makes \nthe lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect. This outer structure helps the molecular\nmachinery of the virus break through cellular membranes \nand hijack our cells. But it has thousands upon thousands \nof weak points where the right molecules \ncould pry it apart. And this is where soap comes in. A single drop of any brand of soap \ncontains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, \nwhich resemble biological lipids. Their tails, which are similarly repulsed\nby water, compete for space with the lipids \nthat make up the virus’s shell. But they’re just different enough to break\nup the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down. Those amphiphiles then form bubbles \nof their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins. Apply water, and you’ll wash \nthat whole bubble away. Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, \nand more like an earthquake. When you surround a coronavirus \nwith water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds \nwithin the membrane their strength. That same effect also holds \nthe big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables \nthem to infect your cells. If you dry the virus out in air, \nit keeps its stability. But now surround it \nwith a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found \nin most hand-sanitizers. This makes the hydrophobic \neffect disappear, and gives the molecules room \nto move around. The overall effect is like removing all \nof the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake. The cell’s membrane collapses \nand those spike proteins crumble. In either method, the actual process \nof destroying the virus happens in just a second or two. But doctors recommend at least \n20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape \nthat is your hand. Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere,\nincluding your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, \nand between your fingers, to protect you properly. And when it comes to a \ncoronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands\nwith soap and water whenever possible. Even though both approaches are similarly \neffective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which \ncould otherwise hide virus particles. But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover \nyour hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Of course, hand sanitizer \nis more convenient to use on the go. In the absence of a sink, use \nthe sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together \nuntil they’re dry. Unfortunately, there are billions \nof people who don’t have access \nto clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time\nbut especially during an outbreak. Researchers and aid groups are working to\nprovide solutions for these communities. One example is a device that uses salt,\nwater, and a car battery to make chlorinated water \nthat kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing. So wherever possible, soap and water \nare recommended for a coronavirus, but does that mean it's best \nfor every viral outbreak? Not necessarily. Many common colds are caused \nby rhinoviruses that have a geometric protein structure\ncalled a capsid instead of a lipid membrane. The capsid doesn't have nearly \nas many weak points where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart, so it takes longer \nfor soap to be effective. However some of its surface \nproteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect \nof hand sanitizer. In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer\nmay be more effective, especially if you then wash \nyour hands to remove residual particles. The best way to know \nwhich to use for any given outbreak is to do what's best \nfor all things illness-related: follow the advice \nof accredited medical professionals."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which are some characteristics of lipid like the ones found on many viruses?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pin shaped"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Heads attracted to water, tails repulsed by water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Heads are usually to the outside of the layer and tails are to the inside"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Form a shell in water"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Stick loosely together"}, {"label": "F", "text": "All of the above describe lipids"}], "correct_option": "F"}, {"question": "Hydrophobic means", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Attracted to water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Water has no effect on it"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Not attracted to water"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both attracted to and unattracted to water depending on the circumstances"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Hand sanitizer contains high concentrations of alcohols such as", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Methanol"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Isopropanol"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ethanol"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both b and c"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The alcohol in hand sanitizer disrupts the hydrophobic effect and what occurs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The molecules get room to move around"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The cell membrane of the virus collapses"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The spike proteins crumble"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above are answers"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "You have a common cold.

Is it a fuzzy sock? An overripe banana? \nA moldy tube of toothpaste? In fact, this is the humble sea cucumber, \nand while it might look odd, its daily toil paves the way \nfor entire ecosystems to thrive. Sea cucumbers are members \nof the phylum Echinodermata, along with sea urchins, starfish \nand other radially symmetrical, “spiny-skinned” marine invertebrates. Some sea cucumbers have feathery tentacles\nflowing from their mouths, some are puffed like bloated balloons, and others simply look like \nHeadless Chicken Monsters— the actual name given \nto a rare deep-sea species. But they are generally characterized \nby their long, cylindrical shape. A sea cucumber is essentially a brainless,\nfleshy form surrounding a digestive tract, bookended by a mouth and an anus. Adhesive tube feet \nrun the length of their bodies and allow them to scoot along \nthe seafloor. Specialized tube feet can be used \nfor feeding and respiration, though many sea cucumbers actually \nbreathe through their anuses. Rhythmically contracting and relaxing \ntheir muscles, they draw water in and out \nover an internal lung-like structure called a respiratory tree\nthat extracts oxygen from seawater. Certain species of crabs and pearlfish take advantage of this \nrhythmic action and, once the sea cucumber’s anus is dilated,\nthey shimmy in and take shelter. The rear end of a single sea cucumber can \nharbor up to fifteen pearlfish at a time. However, it seems that not all \nsea cucumbers put up with this intrusive behavior. Some species are equipped with five teeth\naround their anus, suggesting that they may have taken\nan evolutionary stand against unwanted guests. But even sea cucumbers \nthat lack anal teeth are outfitted with tools \nto defend themselves. They evade threats \nand launch counter-attacks using their mutable collagenous tissue, \nor MCT. This gel-like tissue contains \nbundles of collagen, called “fibrils.” Proteins can interact with these fibrils \nto slide them together, stiffening the tissue, or apart, \nsoftening it. This versatile tissue has many advantages: it aids in efficient locomotion, enables sea cucumbers \nto fit into small spaces, and allows them to reproduce \nasexually by splitting apart. But MCT’s most explosive application \nis employed when a predator attacks. By loosening the attachments \nof internal tissues then quickly softening \nand contracting their muscles, many species are capable of shooting \na wide range of organs out of their anuses. This act is called “evisceration” and it’s a surprisingly effective \ndefense mechanism. In addition to startling \nand distracting predators, the innards of some sea cucumber \nspecies are sticky and toxic. Evisceration may seem drastic, but sea cucumbers are able to regenerate \nwhat they’ve lost to their gut reaction in just a few weeks’ time. Aside from the few species \nthat have evolved to swim and those that feed without moving, many of these cumbersome creatures \npass their time grazing the seabed. Sea cucumbers are found everywhere \nfrom shallow shores to abyssal trenches 6,000 meters \nbelow sea level. On the deep sea floor, they comprise \nthe majority of animal biomass, reaching up to 95% in some areas. As these sausage-shaped wonders \ntrudge along, they vacuum up sand, digest the organic matter it contains, \nand excrete the byproduct. In this process, sea cucumbers clean \nand oxygenate the seafloor by breaking down detritus \nand recycling nutrients. This creates the conditions for sea grass \nbeds and shellfish to thrive. Sea cucumber excretions can also aid \nin coral formation and may play a role in buffering marine \nenvironments from ocean acidification. As the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, \nthey are very good at their job: about half of the sandy seafloor is thought to have passed through \nthe digestive tract of a sea cucumber. So next time you’re rejoicing \nin the feeling of sand crunching between your toes, \nconsider this: those very grains of sand might have, \nat one point or another, been excreted by a pickle \nthat breathes through its butt."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where can sea cucumbers be found?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only tropical waters"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Everywhere"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only deep sea trenches"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only the Arctic Ocean"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How does mutable collagenous tissue (MCT) work?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Collagen fibrils slide together to stiffen the tissue and apart to soften it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Collagen fibrils stick together to soften the tissue and detach to stiffen it"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Collagen fibrils wrap around each other, tightening to stiffen the tissue and relaxing to soften it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Collagen fibrils break apart to soften the tissue and aggregate to stiffen it"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The sea cucumber takes in water through its _____ and oxygen is extracted by the _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mouth; gills"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mouth; respiratory tree"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Anus; gills"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Anus; respiratory tree"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What animal takes shelter in the sea cucumber’s anus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Amano shrimp"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Garden Eels"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pearlfish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Sea cucumbers comprise up to ____% of the animal biomass on the deep sea floor.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "20"}, {"label": "B", "text": "70"}, {"label": "C", "text": "95"}, {"label": "D", "text": "45"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

But how do you know what you're seeing\nis real? Can you really trust your eyes? Take for example these two grey\nrectangular columns, both of which are different shades of\ngrey. Or are they? It turns out that they're the exact same. And yet, even after knowing the illusion is there your eyes refused to see them as the\nsame. Introducing colors produces the same result. I promise no trick photography or\nediting effects have been applied. In fact, if you look up the Munker-White\nillusion, you'll come across many more examples.

Ultimately, our brains judge color and\nbrightness in context. In other words, our brains compare the\nsurrounding environment in order to create our perception. The purpose of our senses or eyes in this case, is not to provide us with an absolute\ncolor or physical property of our external reality, but to interpret what we see as\nefficiently as possible in order to interact with the\nenvironment most appropriately.

Our brains know that shadows make\nobjects look darker, as a result the brain compensates by\ninterpreting the tile as being lighter than it appears until we take the shadow away. Perhaps, the most blatant example is this gradient. The middle bar is simply one color. Remove the background gradient and it\nbecomes obvious. Once again, the darkness of the background has\naffected our perception of the bar's color. Our perception is relative. So do you still trust your eyes? Got a burning question you want answered?

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an American\nBaptist minister, activist humanitarian, and also known for being the leader of the African-American\nCivil Rights Movement. Dr. Martin Luther King was born in Atlanta,\nGeorgia on January 15th in 1929. Now the world knows him today as Dr. Martin\nLuther King Jr, but his name wasn't always Martin. He was actually born and given the name Michael,\nby his father, but that all changed during a trip to Germany where the theologian Martin\nLuther impressed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s father so much that he changed his name and\nhis son’s name too. Now when it came to education Dr. Martin Luther\nKing Jr. was very smart. That's right when he was a kid he literally\nskipped two grades the 9th and the 11th to enter Morehouse College at the young age of\n15 in 1944. Later on Dr. King entered Boston University. There he completed his school work in 1953\nearning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later. Also while he was there he met his love Coretta\nScott. That's right Coretta Scott was a young singer\nfrom Alabama who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music. They later got married in 1953. Not long thereafter he got involved in the\ncivil rights movement taking part in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, after Rosa Parks had been arrested\nby not going to the back of the bus after the bus driver told her she couldn’t sit\nat the front. Of course many know Dr. Martin Luther King\nJr from taking part in the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, where his world famous,\n“I have a dream,” speech set a fire to the civil rights movement there can still\nbe echoed today of people wanting freedom and wanting to be treated equally. From there his name only group and in 1964\ndr. Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel\nPeace Prize. Sadly Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's life was\ncut short being assassinated on April 4 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, while standing on the\nbalcony of the Lorraine Motel.

Now on't get me wrong, I like to read books\ntoo, but I love reading comic books and seeing what my favorite superheroes are up to. What about you? Do you like reading comic books? Maybe you like playing video games and you\nhave to read what is on the screen, to pass on to the next level. No, maybe you like going on the internet and\nplaying games, or talking to people. Well whether you know it or not you are reading. But what if you weren't allowed to read? I know that sounds like a silly question,\nbut what if it were against the law for you to read? Well in American history during slavery African\nAmericans were not allowed to read. It was against the law for slaves to read,\nor even have someone teach them how to read. This is where the next person in African American\nhistory I want to talk about stood up as a leader and an abolitionist. An abolitionist is someone who wanted slavery\nto be stopped, and they spoke out against people who used African Americans as slaves. Right now that person I want to talk to you\nabout is one of the most famous African American abolitionists, by the name of Frederick Douglass. Known as the most recognized African American\nleader before the civil war, Frederick Douglass was born a slave. He never knew his father, and was separated\nfrom his mother earlier in life. This is where as a slave he moved from plantation\nto plantation, until one slave owner’s wife helped him learn the basics of reading. Now like I said before at that time teaching\nslaves to read was against the law, and when her husband found out he stopped her from\nteaching Frederick. Although he didn't have a teacher Frederick\nwas still smart. Frederick wouldn't be stopped in growing and\nlearning how to read. He watched other white children who learned\nin school, and taught himself how to read later. This got him into trouble because he also\ntaught other slaves to read. When his master found out he would beat him,\nbecause he did not want other slaves to learn reading like Frederick did. Frederick eventually stood up to the beatings,\nand one day borrowed the papers of a free sailor and escaped to the north. When he arrived in the North he found other\npeople who were against slavery too. Like I talked about in the beginning these\npeople were called abolitionists. Frederick was really good at talking and speaking\nin front of people and when he told the abolitionists about how he was treated as a slave Frederick\nimpressed them. Frederick later wrote a biography about his\nlife. The biography told about everything he went\nthrough in life. Many people read Fredrick's biography, but\nthis put him in danger, because he was afraid that his master from the South would come\nto the north and capture him knowing he had escaped. This cost Frederick to escape to Britain. He would return years later once he had made\nenough money to purchase his freedom. Upon arriving back Frederick spoke out during\nthe civil war. When it came to Frederick Douglass he had\nrespect all the way up to the White House. Think about it like this, the president today\nis Barack Obama. Wouldn't it be cool if you could talk to Obama\nand he would listen to you? Well Frederick Douglass had the ear of another\nfamous president who would listen to him. That's right, Frederick Douglass gave advice\nto President Abraham Lincoln. Frederick convinced Lincoln to give more weapons\nto African Americans to help fight with the Union soldiers in the Civil War. Now being a great leader in history, Frederick\nspoke out against the poor treatment of African Americans in the United States. Many looked at Frederick's life and thought\nwhy didn't he just escape slavery and live out his days in peace as a free man. But that wasn’t in the cards for Frederick. This was something that he knew he couldn’t\ndo. It was not acceptable to just go out and live\na free life while others while others were being treated poorly. So for standing up and speaking out against\nslavery and the poor treatment of African Americans, Frederick Douglass will always\nbe one of the greats in African American History.

Hey history is full of courageous people who\nstood up to help us get to where we are today. Right now I want to talk to you about one\nof those people named Rosa Parks. Have you ever heard of Rosa Parks? If not that's okay because I am going to give\nyou a few fun facts about Rosa Parks for kids and her life as a civil rights activist. Starting off Rosa Parks was born Rosa Louise\nMcCauley on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. So check this out when Rosa was a kid, she\nmay be just like you, or a kid you know. At a young age her parents decided they would\nnot be together anymore and Rosa moved with her mother to Pine Level, Alabama where they\nstayed with her grandparents. Living with her grandparents allowed Rosa\nto see people do mean things African Americans, but it also showed her how to be strong! Like one day her grandfather protected their\nfarm from a group of men called the Ku Klux Klan. This group was known for killing African Americans\nand her grandfather stood out front protecting their home as the Ku Klux Klan marched by. When it came to school things were not fair\neither. As a child the schools Rosa went to were segregated. This meant that African American students\nwere not allowed to go to school with White Students. Although Rosa enjoyed school, she left school\nin the 11th grade to help her sick mom and grandmother. Later in 1929 she married Raymond parks who\nwas a barber and also a part of the NAACP organization and that the National Association\nfor the Advancement of Colored People. You see back then African America's weren't\ncalled African American. They were called, \"Colored.\" She later got her high school degree and became\ninvolved with the NAACP too as a youth leader. On December 1, 1955, this is when Rosa do\nsomething in history that would spark a change for how African Americans were treated in\nthe United States of America. During this time in Montgomery, Alabama the\nlocal buses were also segregated. Whites would be in the front of the bus and\nAfrican Americans would come to the front of the bus to pay their bus fair but then\nleave the bus and go through the back door to sit at the back of the bus with a sign\nmarked, \"Coloreds.\" On that day Rosa was told by the bus driver\nto move so that a white passenger who got on the bus could have her seat. After thinking about what the bus driver said\nRosa was tired of being treated unfairly and refused to move. After refusing to move the bus driver had\nher arrested. She was later convicted for not following\nthe laws. This made a lot of people mad and sparked\nthe Montgomery Boycott with another major person in African American History, Dr. Martin\nLuther King, Jr. The Montgomery Boycott saw African Americans\ncoming together to refuse using the bus to get around town. The boycott lasted several months and when\nmany buses sat empty the city had to do something. The boycott officially ended on December 20,\n1956 after the Supreme Court said they couldn't treat African Americans unfairly. The life and legacy of Rosa Parks will be\none that will be remembered in our hearts and minds as we go forward\ntrying to create a world that does not judge others on the color of their skin. Rosa parks died on October 24, 2005, at the\nage of 92, but although she is gone her resistance to unfair treatment will never be forgotten\nand I hope you enjoyed this Rosa Parks Biography for kids."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How did Rosa Parks learn to be strong?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rosa watched her grandfather stand up to the Ku Klux Klan when they spoke to him in town."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rosa watched her grandfather protect their farm when the Ku Klux Klan paraded by them."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rosa watched her grandfather stop the Ku Klux Klan from beating another African American."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rosa watched her grandfather work hard to build a good home for their family."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Rosa was always a Civil Rights Activist.
