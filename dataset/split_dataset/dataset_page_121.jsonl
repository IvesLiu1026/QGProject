Some might argue it’s a period \nof extensive military campaigning, like Alexander the Great’s \nin the 300s BCE, which reshaped political\nand cultural borders. Others might cite the emergence \nof a major religion, such as Islam in the 7th century, which codified and spread values\nacross such borders. Or perhaps it’s the Industrial Revolution\nof the 1700s that transformed global commerce and redefined humanity's relationship\nwith labor. Whatever the answer, it seems like \nany century vying for that top spot is at a moment of great change— when the actions of our ancestors shifted\nhumanity’s trajectory for centuries to come. So if this is our metric, \nis it possible that right now— this century— \nis the most important one yet? The 21st century has already proven to be\na period of rapid technological growth. Phones and computers have accelerated\nthe pace of life. And we’re likely on the cusp of developing\nnew transformative technologies, like advanced artificial intelligence, that could entirely change \nthe way people live. Meanwhile, many technologies \nwe already have contribute to humanity’s unprecedented \nlevels of existential risk— that’s the risk of our\nspecies going extinct or experiencing some kind of disaster\nthat permanently limits humanity’s ability to grow and thrive. The invention of the atomic bomb marked\na major rise in existential risk, and since then we’ve only increased\nthe odds against us. It’s profoundly difficult\nto estimate the odds of an existential collapse \noccurring this century. Very rough guesses put the risk \nof existential catastrophe due to nuclear winter and climate change\nat around 0.1%, with the odds of a pandemic causing\nthe same kind of collapse at a frightening 3%. Given that any of these disasters could \nmean the end of life as we know it, these aren’t exactly small figures, And it’s possible this century could see\nthe rise of new technologies that introduce more existential risks. AI experts have a wide range \nof estimates regarding when artificial general intelligence\nwill emerge, but according to some surveys,\nmany believe it could happen this century. Currently, we have relatively narrow forms\nof artificial intelligence, which are designed to do specific tasks \nlike play chess or recognize faces. Even narrow AIs that do creative work are\nlimited to their singular specialty. But artificial general intelligences,\nor AGIs, would be able to adapt to and\nperform any number of tasks, quickly outpacing \ntheir human counterparts. There are a huge variety of guesses\nabout what AGI could look like, and what it would mean\nfor humanity to share the Earth with another sentient entity. AGIs might help us achieve our goals, they might regard us as inconsequential, or, they might see us as an obstacle\nto swiftly remove. So in terms of existential risk, it's imperative the values of this new\ntechnology align with our own. This is an incredibly difficult\nphilosophical and engineering challenge that will require a lot \nof delicate, thoughtful work. Yet, even if we succeed, AGI could still\nlead to another complicated outcome. Let’s imagine an AGI emerges \nwith deep respect for human life and a desire to solve\nall humanity’s troubles. But to avoid becoming misaligned, it's been developed to be incredibly\nrigid about its beliefs. If these machines became \nthe dominant power on Earth, their strict values might\nbecome hegemonic, locking humanity into one ideology that\nwould be incredibly resistant to change. History has taught us that\nno matter how enlightened a civilization thinks they are, they are rarely up to the moral standards\nof later generations. And this kind of value lock in\ncould permanently distort or constrain humanity’s moral growth. There's a ton of uncertainty around AGI, and it’s profoundly difficult to predict\nhow any existential risks will play out over the next century. It’s also possible that new, \nmore pressing concerns might render these risks moot. But even if we can't definitively say that\nours is the most important century, it still seems like the decisions \nwe make might have a major impact on humanity’s future. So maybe we should all live \nlike the future depends on us— because actually, it just might."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How does the video suggest we should measure the importance of a given century?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Moments of great change"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Deadliness of wars"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Number of books written"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Amount of memorable events"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What factors support the case that the 21st century is the most important century?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The development of phones and computers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The advancement of artificial intelligence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increased odds of deadly pandemics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Technology programmed to perform a specific task"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Technology that can perform any number of tasks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Technology programmed to replace humans"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Technology that functions as a weapon against foreign adversaries "}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What danger is posed by a hegemonic system of values?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It leaves little room for moral growth."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It will always become corrupt."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The ruling class will operate exclusively out of self interest."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Citizens will become bored by the lack of creative thought."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why is most concerning about the development of AGI?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The monetary investment is incredibly steep."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Humans cannot agree on the religious values to give the technology."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It brings a great amount of existential uncertainty."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The knowledge we impart on the technology now will soon be obsolete."}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

The first involved is our soon-to-be\nqueen leafcutter ant. The second is this fungus, a piece of\nwhich she scoops into her mouth pocket. The third are these tiny cockroaches,\nwhich nestle under her wings. And the fourth is the one\nthat threatens them all. But it’ll reveal itself later. In a flapping-wing frenzy,\nour ant takes to the sky. This is the only chance\nshe’ll have to mate, so she stores as much sperm as she can\nfrom the males she meets in midair. After dropping to the ground, \nshe sheds her wings and begins digging. She excavates a tunnel and a side chamber,\nthen plugs the entrance, sealing herself in. There, she regurgitates the fungus. This pile of puke will form \nthe bedrock of her kingdom. Over the following weeks, in between laying eggs \nand consuming the infertile ones, she tends to her developing fungal garden, fertilizing it with feces. Finally, her first offspring surge\nforth and establish a rhythm. Soldiers guard the nest while foragers\nset off to find tender foliage. The larger foragers, \nequipped with powerful mandibles, anchor themselves on leaves \nand chomp away in a wide arcs. Holding these pieces aloft, which can weigh more than eight times\ntheir body mass, the workers march back to the nest. Meanwhile, the colony’s smallest ants\nclean the leaf fragments of debris and pathogens. But the colony doesn’t eat these morsels. Instead, the ants use them\nto sustain their fungus, which, in turn, sustains the colony. More than 10 million years ago, \nleafcutter ants domesticated fungus. Like many of our crops, \nthe fungus they farm is genetically distinct \nfrom its wild relatives and can no longer survive\nwithout their help. Reciprocally, the fungus provides \nthe ants with an essential amino acid and digestive enzymes they’ve lost. Once the workers return \nto the nest with their spoils, they crush up the leaves, making their offerings easier \nfor the fungus to consume. Foragers work tirelessly \nover the following months. They create thousands of trails,\nstretching hundreds of meters. All of them are perfumed \nwith the ants’ pheromones and constantly cleaned \nto function as efficient highways. Meanwhile, the queen lays thousands\nof eggs every day and is tended to by members\nof her entourage, which nourish her \nwith the large, infertile eggs they lay. Among enclosures containing\ngarbage and growing larvae, workers tend fungal gardens in various\nchambers throughout the colony. They prune bits of the fungus \nto stimulate growth and strategically open and close\nsurface tunnels, controlling the humidity. But ants aren't the only\nanimals down here. Tiny cockroaches like those that\noriginally crept under the queen’s wings feed opportunistically off the fungus. Each could fit on the head of a Q-Tip. They hitch rides on soon-to-be queens, and make their way \nto more established colonies. Inside the leafcutter nest,\nthey’re undercover: closely mimicking the ants’\nsignature scent, they frolic and feed \nin the fungal gardens, mostly undetected. And here’s where this tale’s antagonist\nrears its virulent fruiting body: our elusive fourth character is a \nparasitic micro-fungus called Escovopsis. If left unchecked, it would destroy \nthe fungal gardens and the ants and the cockroaches that depend on them. The leafcutters mount \na barrage of defenses. They rigorously weed Escovopsis out and partner up with different\nmicroorganisms like yeasts and bacteria to stunt its growth. Eventually, the leafcutter colony covers\nseveral meters of underground tunnels, comprises millions of workers, and can\ndefoliate a tree in a single night. The queen’s kingdom will persist \nas long as she does, which may be over a decade. Every spring, some of the queen’s\noffspring prepare to leave. They grab a piece of home \nand crowd the surface chambers, preparing to fly off and mate, \nbeginning the cycle anew."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where does the queen ant store the fungus she takes from her original nest?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Under her wings"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Inside a special pocket in her mouth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In her feet"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All over her body"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What happens to the leaves forager ants cut down?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The ants eat them"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The ants feed them to the queen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The ants feed them to the fungus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The leaves disguise the nest’s entrance"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "While founding a new colony, queens:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Seal themselves inside their nest and start laying eggs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Attack other nearby colonies to steal their resources"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Go foraging for leaves to feed their fungus garden"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Seek out more males to mate with"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT one of the ways worker ants help their fungus grow?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Controlling humidity in the nest by opening and closing tunnels"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Feeding it crushed-up leaf fragments"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Weeding Escovopsis out of their fungus garden"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Letting cockroaches feed on it"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What makes leafcutter ants unique, compared to other ants?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They tend gardens of domesticated fungus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They eat leaves"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They live in big colonies"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They all grow wings"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

His illness passed after a few days, but a stranger set of symptoms lingered. Although his muscles and joints\nremained healthy, Waterman was unable to move. In fact, he was unable to feel\nanything from the neck down. Eventually, he was diagnosed with a rare\nand extreme form of deafferentation, a neurological condition \nin which certain signals from the nervous system are \ninterrupted or impaired. Without his body's constant feedback\non how his limbs were moving, Waterman was unable to sit up,\nstand, or walk. But over time, he taught himself\nto use sight to judge the distance of his limbs from other objects. And eventually he regained \ncomplete control of his body— so long as he could see it. We often don’t think of touch \nas being a vital part of movement. But touch is just one part \nof the somatosensory system, a network that oversees all the sensations arising from the surface and interior \nof our bodies. Touch, pain, temperature, \nand our awareness of our bodies in space— also known as proprioception— \nare regulated by this system. And when something goes wrong,\nthe effects can be dramatic. All these sensations are processed\nby millions of tiny receptor cells embedded in our skin, muscles,\ntendons, and organs. Every square centimeter of our skin\nis packed with hundreds of these cells, and their shape, size, and depth determine\nwhat kind of stimuli they respond to. Mechanoreceptors sense mechanical\ndeformation of the skin. This could be triggered by low\nor high frequency vibrations, a stretch, \nor simply light, static pressure. Thermoreceptors respond\nto temperature changes, while nociceptors sense pain. And propriocepters sit deep \nin your muscles and tendons, continually detecting \nand relaying information about the position of your body. Your brain then combines this information\nwith other sensory data to move through space \nwithout needing to see your limbs. All of these receptors work by sending\nelectrical signals to the brain through fibers they’re attached to. And the speed of those signals \nvaries with the fiber’s thickness. For example, some nociceptors \nare attached to fibers with slightly more conductive,\nfatty myelin than others. So when you get hurt, the electrical\nimpulses from thicker nociceptors trigger sharp, intense pain, while thin, unmyelinated nociceptors\nare responsible for the dull, aching pain that follows. And since the fibers carrying \ntactile information are much thicker than those carrying nociceptive signals, rubbing an injury can produce \ntemporary relief from the pain These receptors generate \na constant flood of signals that travel through the nervous system\nto the brain. But if this process is disrupted— either by damage to the skin, \nthe nerves, or the brain— the network breaks down. And since it underpins so many\nbodily functions, damage to the somatosensory system can\nmanifest in a wide variety of ways. In Waterman’s case, \nan autoimmune reaction attacked a large swath \nof his nervous system, leaving him with no tactile \nor proprioceptive sensations from the neck down. But deafferentation is just one \nof many somatosensory disorders. Individuals can receive damage to a \nspecific brain area or a section of skin, resulting in the loss of certain \nsensations in particular locations. And the impact of this loss\ncan be significant. Losing tactile sensations makes it\ndifficult to gauge how much strength to use in a situation. Without the warning signals provided\nby thermal and pain stimuli, we don’t react when our\nbodies are damaged. And, being deprived of social touch\ncan cause a condition known as touch starvation, characterized by anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, \nand even a weakened immune system. Many individuals who face these realities\nhave found innovative ways to adapt. But it’s undeniable that all these\ninvisible sensations play a vital role \nin how we navigate the world— even if they can be difficult\nto put your finger on."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The _____ provide information about the position of our body in space.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Thermoreceptors"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Proprioceptors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mechanoreceptors"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nociceptors"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Thicker fibers convey electric signals to the brain at a _____ speed than thinner fibers", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lower"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Equal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Higher"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Similar"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Mechanoreceptors are sensitive to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pressure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Vibration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stretch"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The somatosensory system processes", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tactile and painful sensations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Proprioception and deafferentation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Any sensation arising from the body"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The fibers carrying _____ sensations are much _____ than those carrying nociceptive information, and that’s why rubbing an injury can alleviate the pain.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Thermal / thinner"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Painful / thicker"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tactile / thicker"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tactile / thinner"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 121, "lesson": 4, "title": "How do airplanes actually fly? - Raymond Adkins", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-airplanes-stay-in-the-air-raymond-adkins", "transcript": {"en": "By 1917, Albert Einstein had explained \nthe relationship between space and time. But, that year, he designed\na flawed airplane wing. His attempt was based \non an incomplete theory of flight. Indeed, insufficient and inaccurate\nexplanations still circulate today. So, where did Einstein go wrong? And how do planes fly? Though we don’t always think of it\nthis way, air is a fluid medium— it’s just less dense \nthan liquids like water. Things that are lighter than air\nare buoyant within it, while heavier objects require an upward\nforce, called lift, to stay aloft. For planes, this force is mostly\ngenerated by the wings. One especially pervasive false \ndescription of lift is the “Longer Path” \nor “Equal Transit Time” explanation. It states that air molecules traveling\nover the top of a curved wing cover a longer distance than those\ntraveling underneath. For the air molecules above to reach\nthe wing’s trailing edge in the same instance as those \nthat split off and went below, air must travel faster above, creating a pocket of lower pressure \nthat lifts the plane. This explanation has\nbeen thoroughly debunked. Air molecules floating above and below\nthe wing don't need to meet back up. In reality, the air traveling\nabove reaches the wing’s trailing edge much faster than the air beneath. To get a sense of how lift\nis actually generated, let's simulate an airplane wing in motion. As it moves forward, the wing affects\nthe movement of the air around it. As air meets the wing’s solid surface,\na thin layer sticks to the wing. This layer pulls the surrounding\nair with it. The air splits into pathways \nabove and below the wing, following the wing’s contour. As the air that’s routed above makes \nits way around the nose of the wing, it experiences centripetal acceleration, the force you also feel \nin a sharply turning car. The air above therefore gathers more\nspeed than the air traveling below. This increased speed is coupled with a\ndecrease in pressure above the wing, which pulls even more air \nacross the wing’s upper surface. The air flowing across the\nlower surface, meanwhile, experiences less of a change\nin direction and speed. The pressure across the wing’s \nlower surface is thus higher than that above the upper surface. This pressure difference results \nin the upwards force of lift. The faster the plane travels, the greater the pressure difference,\nand the greater that force. Once it overcomes the downward force\nof gravity, the plane takes off. Air flows smoothly around curved wings. But a wing’s curvature is\nnot the cause of lift. In fact, a flat wing that’s tilted \nupwards can also create lift— as long as the air bends around it, contributing to and reinforcing\nthe pressure difference. Meanwhile, having a wing\nthat’s too curved or steeply angled can be disastrous: the airflow above may detach \nfrom the wing and become turbulent. This is probably what happened \nwith Einstein’s wing design, nicknamed “the cat’s back.” By increasing the wing’s curvature, Einstein thought it would \ngenerate more lift. But one test pilot reported \nthat the plane wobbled like “a pregnant duck” in flight. Our explanation is still \na simplified description of this nuanced, complex process. Other factors, like the air that’s flowing\nmeters beyond the wing’s surface— being swept up, then down— as well as air vortices formed\nat the wing’s tips, all influence lift. And, while experts agree that \nthe pressure difference generates lift, their explanations for how can vary. Some might emphasize the air’s behavior\nat the wing’s surface, others the upward force created \nas the air is deflected downwards. However, there's no controversy\nwhen it comes to the math. Engineers use a set of formulas \ncalled the Navier-Stokes equations to precisely model air’s flow \naround a wing and detail how lift is generated. More than a century after Einstein’s\nforay into aeronautics, lift retains its reputation\nas a confounding concept. But when it feels like it’s all going\nto come crashing down, remember: it’s just the physics of fluid in motion. This video was made possible \nwith support from Marriott Hotels.

But were his enlightened principles\noutweighed by participation in a greater injustice? Find out on History versus \nThomas Jefferson. Order! Order! Hey, that’s one \nof the guys from Mt. Rushmore. Ahem. This is Thomas Jefferson, founding father of the United States\nof America and primary author \nof the Declaration of Independence. The document that established \nthe US as a democratic republic on the principle that everyone\nis created equal. If by “everyone” you mean \nproperty-owning white men. At the time Jefferson was writing, one fifth of the colonies’ population \nwas enslaved. Surely he couldn’t be expected\nto single-handedly overturn the institution of slavery? Couldn’t he have just written \nthat into the Declaration? It wasn’t that simple, Your Honor. Jefferson was one of five authors, and the document had to be ratified\nby the Continental Congress. He included a clause opposing \nthe slave trade, but state delegates removed it. Nevertheless, Jefferson recognized\nslavery as an immoral institution and condemned it throughout his life. But Jefferson’s words never came close\nto matching his actions! As Virginia’s governor, he did nothing\nto change the state slave laws. And in his personal life, \nhe held over 600 people in slavery. Furthermore, he believed Black people\nwere intellectual inferiors who, if emancipated, should return \nto their countries of origin. Frankly, there’s no argument that\nJefferson did anything significant to combat slavery. It’s true, Your Honor. But Jefferson did make \nimportant contributions to religious, financial,\nand gender equality. He led the charge for separating\nchurch and state, removing government funding \nfor Virginia’s Anglican Church, and paving the way for our modern\nunderstanding of religious freedom. Jefferson also drafted laws that weakened\nthe power of inherited wealth and pushed for the state-funded education \nof boys and girls. All valuable reforms, but you’re avoiding \nthe fundamental issue here. None of this benefited enslaved people\nor Indigenous Americans, and it’s ridiculous to argue\nthat Jefferson was pursuing equality when his policies frequently harmed\nnon-white groups. Policies such as authorizing the military to exterminate Indigenous communities\nduring the Revolutionary War. Objection! Those Northwestern tribes were\nallied with the British. In peacetime, Jefferson did his best \nto avoid conflict with Native Americans and believed they could be equal \nto whites. “Could be equal”? Listen to yourself! Are you defending his attempts to forcibly\nassimilate Indigenous communities? Jefferson’s recommendations\neven formed the basis for the Indian Removal Act years later. Recommendations? Why not laws? Thomas Jefferson served as a diplomat\nand Secretary of State before being elected as Vice President\nunder John Adams in 1796. A role in which he undermined\nthe President’s authority. Jefferson argued that states \nshould have the power to overrule federal laws\nthey deemed unconstitutional— an argument some Southern states\nwould cite while seceding from the Union 70 years later. I think it’s a little unreasonable to lay \nthe entire Civil War at Jefferson’s feet. Besides, his defense of states’\nrights was motivated by the president’s overreaching\ncentral government. As part of Adams’ preparations\nfor war with France, he signed legislation that tightened\nrestrictions on immigrants and limited criticism of the government. Jefferson was just trying\nto protect the public. And ultimately, his efforts were \nso popular that he was elected as the next president. A dubious victory. He only won because states were allowed\nto count enslaved people towards their population without giving\nthem voting rights. This system gave states that held people\nin slavery additional voting power in the Electoral College \nuntil the Civil War. Be that as it may, \nJefferson was a popular president. He worked to prevent the country\nfrom taking on too much debt, and successfully led the US through the\nNapoleonic and the Barbary Wars. Plus, he dramatically expanded \nthe country’s territory through the Louisiana Purchase. Where he once again failed to stop\nslavery from taking hold. I’ll remind you that President Jefferson\nsigned a law forbidding the importation \nof enslaved people in 1807. And yet he continued to enslave those\nalready on American soil— including his own flesh and blood. Pardon? Following his wife's death, Jefferson began a relationship with her\nhalf-sister and maid, Sally Hemings. Jefferson fathered six children\nwith Hemings and kept the entire relationship secret, while continuing to publicly denounce\nthe personhood of Black Americans. Jefferson freed several members\nof the Hemings family, including his children with Sally— While refusing to free anyone else. Despite enslaving over 600 people,\nJefferson only freed 10. Five during his life and five in his will— all members of the Hemings family. Even I have to admit, \nthis seems indefensible. It’s true, Your Honor. Despite pursuing what he believed \nto be equality, Jefferson failed to uphold his own ideals. Ultimately, he was a man of his time— living in an economy that relied \non exploitation and enslaved labor. That’s hardly a defense when many \nof Jefferson’s contemporaries opposed slavery and took action\nto abolish it. Even if some people considered\nhim a great man in his time, he doesn’t have to be an icon in ours. Well, I hear Mount Rushmore has\na problematic past, too. Can we judge historical figures\nby modern standards? And what responsibilities do \npowerful people have to the future?

As convenient as it would be to go \nto sleep a child and wake up an adult, this maturation is slow, and puberty lasts as long as 4 to 5 years. And during this extended process, the brain undergoes \nits own transformation, thanks to two of puberty’s key players—\nestrogen and testosterone. Produced in the developing \ntestes and ovaries, these hormones hitch a ride \nto the brain via the bloodstream. Once there, they interact \nwith receptors on neurons, changing the way the individual cells \nwork and function by making them more or less excitable, \naltering their growth, or reshaping their connections. Cumulatively, this can change how\nyou feel, think, and behave. For example, hormones remodel \nand develop the limbic system, a collection of brain regions responsible\nfor emotional behavior. Research in animal models suggests \nthat the amygdala undergoes changes in size and connectivity during puberty. The amygdala’s function is wide-ranging, from detecting threats \nin your environment, to helping you recognize emotions \nin your friend’s faces. Its development allows you to better\nconnect with your peers, while priming your brain \nfor learning and discovery. Likewise, puberty organizes\nand restructures the nucleus accumbens involved in reward and sensation-seeking. Activity in this dopamine\nhub is thought to drive the pleasurable sensations we feel when\ndoing rewarding activities, like spending time with friends \nor having new experiences. Several studies have found that as hormone levels increase\nthrough puberty, so does the response \nof the nucleus accumbens. As a result, exploration and social\nengagement may feel that much more important \nduring adolescence. As these emotion and reward\ncenters rapidly develop, their connections with higher cortical\nbrain regions tend to do so on an extended timeline. These cortical regions, which help impose \nemotional regulation and impulse control, continue to grow well past puberty,\ninto your 20s. While teens are often unfairly stereotyped\nas rash or impulsive, research reveals a more complex story. Teens are just as capable as adults \nof making thoughtful decisions when given the time and space. It’s only during high stress \nor in the heat of the moment that teens may find it more\ndifficult to manage emotions. Further, this lengthy cortical development\nallows adolescent brains to remain adaptable as they learn\nand grow in new situations, form their identities, and build \nthe skill sets needed for adulthood. For all we know about the effects\nof puberty on the brain, there remain many unanswered questions. What sets off the initial puberty\nsignal in the brain? Why is the average onset \nof puberty shifting earlier? And, while hormones may seem powerful,\nthey may not be the full story. Experiences you have during adolescence\nmay be just as influential as hormones in shaping and maturing\nthe developing brain. So while all these physical and mental\nchanges can make you feel as if puberty is in control, you have more power than you think. The everyday choices you make, from learning new skills, to being \na good friend, to setting boundaries, ultimately steer the path \nof who you are and will become.

I didn't tell my parents\nwhen I got home that night, because the next day,\nmy dad was taking me to see a movie, a soccer movie. I worried that if I told\nmy parents about the foot, they would take me to see a doctor. I didn't want to see a doctor, I wanted to see the movie. The next morning, my dad goes, \"It's nice out. Why don't we walk\nto the theater.\" (Laughter) It was a mile away. As we go, he says, \"Why are you limping?\" I tell him I have something in my shoe. The movie was spectacular. It told the story of some\nof soccer's greatest stars, great Brazilian players. I was ecstatic. At the end of the movie,\nI told my dad about the foot; he took me to see an orthopedic doctor, who put my foot in a cast for three weeks. I tell you the story today,\nbecause four decades later, I don't really consider myself\na soccer fan anymore. Today, my sports fandom\nis tuned to another kind of football. Now my 12-year-old self\nwouldn't just find this incomprehensible. My 12-year-old self\nwould see this as a betrayal. Now you might say we all change\nfrom the time we are 12, so let me fast-forward a decade. When I was 22, I was a freshly minted\nelectronics engineer in southern India. I had no idea that three decades later,\nI would be living in the United States, that I would be a journalist, and that I would be the host\nof a podcast called \"Hidden Brain.\" It's a show about human behavior and how to apply\npsychological science to our lives. Now we didn’t have podcasts\nwhen I graduated from college. We didn’t walk around\nwith smartphones in our pockets. So my future was not just unknown; it was unknowable. All of us have seen what this is like\nin the last three years, as we slowly try and emerge\nfrom the COVID pandemic. If we think about the people we used to be\nthree years ago, before the pandemic, we can see how we have changed. We can see how anxiety and isolation and upheavals in our lives\nand livelihoods, how this has changed us,\nchanged our outlook, changed our perspective. But there is a paradox here, and the paradox is when we look backwards, we can see enormous changes\nin who we have become. But when we look forwards, we tend to imagine that we're going to be\nthe same people in the future. Now sure, we imagine the world\nis going to be different. We know what AI and climate change is going to mean\nfor a very different world. But we don't imagine that we ourselves\nwill have different perspectives, different views, different\npreferences in the future. I call this the illusion of continuity. And I think one reason this happens\nis that when we look backwards, the contrast with our prior selves\nto who we are today is so clear. We can see it so clearly\nthat we have become different people. When we look forward, we can imagine\nourselves being a little older, a little grayer, but we don't imagine, fundamentally, that we're going to have\na different outlook or perspective, that we're going to be different people. And so those changes seem more amorphous. I want to make the case to you today that this illusion\nhas profound consequences not just for whether we become\nsoccer players or podcast hosts, but for matters involving life and death. Let me introduce you\nto John and Stephanie Rinka. We did a story about them\nfor \"Hidden Brain\" some years ago. This photograph was taken in 1971,\non their wedding day. John and Stephanie had just eloped, and gotten married at Cambridge\nCity Hall in Massachusetts. He was 22, she was 19. John told me that after they got married, they traveled to different parts\nof the country. They eventually settled in North Carolina. John became a high school\nbasketball coach, Stephanie became a nurse. And because they lived\nin a rural part of the state, she would often make\nhouse visits to patients. Many of the patients\nshe saw were very sick. They had terminal illnesses,\nvery low quality of life. And when Stephanie\ncame home from these visits, she was often shaken. And she would tell John, \"John, if I ever get a terminal illness, please do nothing to prolong my suffering. I care more about quality of life\nthan quantity of life. In her more dramatic\nmoments, she would say, \"John, if I ever get\nthat sick, just shoot me. Just shoot me.\" And John Rinka would look\nlovingly at his wife, his healthy wife, and he would say, \"OK, Steph. OK.\" Fast-forward a couple of decades. In her late fifties,\nStephanie begins to slur her words. She goes to see a doctor,\nwho runs some tests, and he diagnoses her with ALS,\nLou Gehrig's disease. He tells her it's fatal. It's incurable. And he tells her that a day\nis going to come when she is no longer able\nto breathe on her own. Stephanie, being Stephanie, decides to extract as much joy\nand pleasure from life as she can, she spends time with friends and family. As she gets sicker, she and John spend some time\non a beautiful beach that they both love. But there comes a day when Stephanie,\nin fact, is no longer able to breathe. She's gasping for air,\nand John takes her to the hospital. And a nurse at the hospital\nasked Stephanie, \"Mrs. Rinka, would you like us\nto put you on a ventilator?\" And Stephanie says yes. John is flabbergasted. They've been having\nthis conversation for 30 years. Surely that's not what Stephanie wants. He doesn't say anything. The next morning, he says, \"Steph, when the nurse asked you yesterday\nif you wanted to go on a ventilator, and you said yes, is that really what you want?\" And Stephanie Rinka said yes. Now, you might argue that if Stephanie\nhad written out an advance directive, if Stephanie had come\ninto the hospital unconscious, if the nurse had asked John,\n\"What is it your wife would want?\" John, without hesitation, would have said, \"Of course she does not want\nto go on a ventilator. We should figure out a way to keep her\nas comfortable as possible so that she can die with dignity.\" But of course, this only solves\nthe legal conundrum. It doesn't solve the ethical problem here. And the ethical problem is that Stephanie,\nat age 39, as she was healthy, had no real conception\nof what Stephanie at age 59, with a terminal illness, gasping for air, would really want. For the older Stephanie, her younger self might as well\nhave been a stranger. A stranger who was trying to make\nlife and death decisions for her. Philosophers have talked for many years\nabout a thought experiment; it’s sometimes called\nthe “ship of Theseus”. The great warrior Theseus\nreturned from his exploits, his ship was stationed\nin the harbor as a memorial. And over the decades, parts of the ship\nbegan to rot and decay, and as this happened,\nplanks were replaced by new planks. Until, eventually,\nevery part of the ship of Theseus was built from something new. And philosophers, starting with Plato, have asked the question \"If every part\nof the ship of Theseus is new, is this still the ship of Theseus?\" You and I are walking examples\nof the ship of Theseus. Our cells turn over all the time. The people you were 10 years ago\nare not the people you are today. Biologically, you have become\na different person. But I believe something much more profound\nhappens at a psychological level. Because you could argue a ship\nis not just a collection of planks, a body is not just a collection of cells. It's the organization of the planks\nthat makes the ship. It's the organization of the cells\nthat make the body. If you preserve the organization, even if you swap planks\nor cells in and out, you still have the ship,\nyou still have the same body. But at a psychological level, each new layer that's put down is not identical\nto the one that came before it. The famous plasticity of the brain\nthat we've all heard so much about means that, on an ongoing basis, you are constantly becoming a new person. This has profound consequences\nfor so many aspects of our lives. You know, I have the illusion\nthat 12-year-old Shankar who wanted to be a soccer star, and 52-year-old Shankar\nwho is the podcast host and 82-year-old Shankar, who will hopefully be living one day\non a beautiful beach, that these are all the same person. Is that really true? Let's set aside the philosophical\nquestions for another day, and let me tell you\nabout some of the practical challenges of this problem. When we make promises to other people, when we promise to love someone\ntill death do us part, we are making a promise\nthat a stranger is going to have to keep. Our future selves might not share\nour views, our perspectives, our hopes. When we lock people up\nand throw away the key, it's not just that the people we imprison\nare going to be different in 30 years. We are going to be different\n30 years from now. Our need for retribution, for vengeance,\nmight not be what it is today. (Applause) When we pass laws, we often do so with an intent\nof making a better country, improving our country. But any country that's been around\nfor a few decades has numerous laws on the books that made perfect sense\nwhen they were crafted -- in fact, that were seen as enlightened\nwhen they were crafted -- and today, they seem antiquated\nor absurd, or even unconscionable. And all of these examples\nstem from the same problem, which is that we imagine\nthat we represent the end of history. That the future is only\ngoing to be more of the same. I have three pieces of advice on how to wrestle\nwith this wicked problem. And it is a wicked problem, because all of us spend\nso much of our lives trying to make our future selves happy. We don't stop to ask, \"Is it possible that in 20 or 30 years, our future selves\nare going to look back at us with bewilderment, with resentment. That our future selves will ask us, \"What made you possibly think\nthat that is what I would want?\" The first piece of advice I have is if you accept the idea\nthat you're going to be a different person in 30 years' time, you should play an active role crafting\nthe person you are going to become. You should be the curator\nof your future self. You should be the architect\nof your future self. But what does that mean? Spend time with people\nwho are not just your friends and family. Spend time on avocations\nand professional pursuits that are not just what you do regularly. Expand your horizons, because you're going to become\nsomeone different, you might as well be in charge of deciding\nwho that person is going to be. So the first piece of advice\nis to stay curious. Second, as we make pronouncements\non social media or in political forums, or at dinner parties, let's bear in mind that among the people\nwho might disagree with us are our own future selves. (Laughter) So when we express views\nwith great certitude and confidence, let's remember to add a touch of humility. This is true, by the way,\nnot just at an individual level -- it's also true at an organizational level. I was speaking, some time ago,\nwith this young, wonderful woman. She had just reached a position\nof authority at her organization, and she had many idealistic ideas of how she wanted to change\nher organization. And she asked me,\n\"How do we make these changes so that in the future, no one's going to come along and undo\nthe changes that I have made?\" And it's a very human impulse,\nbut it stems from the same belief, that our perspective on history\nis the final word. And quite simply, this is wrong. Three. I've given you a number of ways in which our future selves are going to be\nweaker and frailer than we are today. And that is true,\nthat is part of the story. But it is only a part of the story. Our future selves are also going to have\ncapacities and strengths and wisdom that we do not possess today. So when we confront opportunities\nand we hesitate, when I tell myself,\n\"I don't think I have it in me to quit my job and start my own company,\" or I tell myself I don't have it in me\nto learn a musical instrument at the age of 52. Or I tell myself I don't have it in me\nto look after a disabled child. What we really should be saying is \"I don't have the capacity\nto do those things today. That doesn’t mean I won’t have\nthe capacity to do those things tomorrow.” So lesson number three is to be brave. I believe if you can do\nthese three things, if you can stay curious, you can practice humility\nand you can be brave, then your future self\nwill look back at you in 20 or 30 years -- will look back, not with resentment or bewilderment, but will look back at you and say: \"Thank you.\" (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

The structure’s architect, Hemiunu, determined he would need 20 years\nto finish the royal tomb. But what he could not predict was\nthat this monument would remain the world’s tallest manmade structure\nfor over 3,800 years. To construct the Great Pyramid, Hemiunu would need to dig \na 6-and-a-half-kilometer canal, quarry enormous amounts of limestone\nand granite, and use kilometers of rope \nto pull stones into place. Today, there are still vigorous debates\nabout the exact methods the Egyptians employed. But we do know that first Hemiunu\nneeded a construction site. The Egyptians spoke of death \nas going west like the setting sun, and the Nile’s west bank had \na plateau of bedrock that could support the pyramid \nbetter than shifting sand. In a brilliant timesaving move, masons carved the plateau itself \nto look like the stones used for the rest of the pyramid. With this level foundation in place,\nconstruction could begin. The project called for a staggering\n25,000 workers, but fortunately, Hemiunu had\nan established labor supply. Egyptians were required to perform \nmanual labor for the government throughout the year, and citizens from across the country\ncame to contribute. Workers performed a wide range\nof tasks, from crafting tools and clothes\nto administrative work to back-breaking manual labor. But contrary to popular belief, \nthese workers were not enslaved people. In fact, these citizens were housed\nand fed with rations better than the average Egyptian \ncould afford. To complete the project in 20 years, one block of stone would need \nto be quarried, transported, and pushed into place \nevery 3 minutes, 365 days a year. Workers averaged 10-hour days, hauling\nlimestone from two different quarries. One was close to the site, but its fossil-lined yellow stone\nwas deemed suitable only for the pyramid’s interior. Stones for the outside were hauled \nfrom roughly 13 kilometers away, using 9-meter long sleds \nmade from giant cedar trunks. When mined from the ground, limestone is soft and splits easily\ninto straight lines. But after air exposure it hardens, requiring wooden mallets and copper\nchisels to shape. The pyramid used over 2 million stones,\neach weighing up to 80 tons. And there was no room for error\nin how they were shaped. Even the smallest inaccuracy at the bottom\nof the pyramid could result in a catastrophic failure at the top. Researchers know where the materials used\nto build the pyramids came from and how they were transported, but the actual construction process\nremains mysterious. Most experts agree that limestone ramps\nwere used to move the stones into place, but there are many theories on the number\nof ramps and their locations. And the pyramid’s exterior\nis just half the story. Since death could come\nfor the pharaoh at any time, Hemiunu always needed an accessible\nburial chamber at the ready, so three separate burial chambers\nwere built during construction. The last of these, \nknown as the King’s Chamber, is a spacious granite room\nwith a soaring ceiling, located at the heart of the pyramid. it lay on top of an 8.5-meter high\npassageway called the Grand Gallery, which may have been used \nas an ancient freight elevator to move granite up the pyramid’s interior. Granite was used for all \nthe pyramid’s support beams. Much stronger than limestone, \nbut extremely difficult to shape, workers used dolerite rocks as hammers\nto slowly quarry the stone. To ensure the granite beams would be ready\nwhen he needed them, Hemiunu dispatched 500 workers \nin the project’s first year so that the material would be ready\n12 years later. Five stories of granite sit\natop the King’s Chamber, preventing the pyramid \nfrom collapsing in on itself. Once complete, the entire structure\nwas encased with white limestone, polished with sand and stone\nuntil it gleamed. Finally, a capstone was placed on top. Covered with electrum \nand glimmering like gold, this peak shined like\na second sun over all of Egypt. This video was made possible with support\nfrom Marriott Hotels.

{"page": 121, "lesson": 9, "title": "Is it possible to lose weight fast? - Hei Man Chan", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/is-it-possible-to-lose-weight-fast-hei-man-chan", "transcript": {"en": "In the wealthiest circles \nof Victorian England, bizarre fads ran rampant. But perhaps none was as strange\nas the tapeworm diet, in which dieters swallowed\nan unhatched tapeworm and let it grow inside them \nby consuming undigested meals. Obviously, this is an exceptionally\ndangerous and unhealthy way to manage your weight. However, while modern fad diets\naren't usually this extreme, they do promise similar results;\nspecifically, losing weight fast. So, are there any fast diets that do work? And are any of them \nactually healthy for you? To answer these questions, \nlet’s consider a thought experiment. Sam and Felix are identical twins\nboth planning to go on a diet. They share the same height, weight,\nfat and muscle mass. But Sam is hoping to lose weight slowly,\nwhile Felix wants to go fast. Sam's plan is to gradually decrease\nhis calorie intake and increase his regular exercise. With less energy coming in\nand more being expended, he’s creating an energy deficit\ninside his body. To compensate, Sam’s body begins breaking \ndown his emergency glucose supply, stored in the liver \nin the form of glycogen. Then, after 4 to 6 hours, \nhis body starts burning fat cells as a major energy source. This process releases lipid droplets which are broken down into compounds\nthat float through the bloodstream and provide energy to organs and tissues. Felix aims to create \na similar energy deficit by dramatically cutting \nhis calorie intake. Unlike Sam, \nwho’s still eating smaller meals, Felix is eating almost nothing. And his body responds by going\ninto a starvation response. Felix’s body breaks down his entire store\nof emergency glucose in just 18 hours. And while Sam steadily replenishes\nglycogen with every healthy meal, Felix’s low-calorie diet does not. Desperate for energy, his body starts\nbreaking down other materials, including his muscles. Meanwhile, Sam’s regular exercise \nis maintaining his muscle mass. This means he’ll use more energy\nboth during exercise and at rest, making it easier for him to lose weight. Felix, on the other hand,\nis losing muscle mass and burning fewer calories than ever\nfor his body's basic functions, making weight loss even more difficult. Despite all this, there’s one element\nof Felix’s fast diet that might make him think\nhe's on the right track. Every gram of glycogen is bound\nto several grams of water. This can add up to two kilograms\nof water weight, all of which is lost \nwhen the glycogen is depleted. For Felix, this might seem like\nhe’s losing weight fast. But as soon as he stops starving himself, his body will replenish its glycogen store\nand regain that weight. Clearly, Felix’s plan does\nmore harm than good, but extreme calorie reduction diets\naren’t the only regimens promising to shed weight fast. Plans called “detoxification diets” \neither promote or restrict certain foods to provide specific nutrients\nin high quantities. These can be useful for addressing\nsome nutritional problems, but they’re far too specific \nto be used as general cure-alls. For example, for a person \nwith low vitamin A, a juice diet might be helpful. But for someone high in vitamin A,\njuicing could be disastrous. And regardless of personal nutrition, maintaining a juice diet \nover multiple weeks is likely to compromise the immune system due to a lack of essential fats\nand proteins. Therein lies the problem \nwith all these fast-moving diets— whether you’re cutting calories\nor food groups, extreme diets are a shock to your system. There are well-established rates \nof healthy weight loss motivated by both diet and exercise that account for genetic and medical\ndifferences. And staying on those timelines requires \na dietary lifestyle that’s sustainable. In fact, some of the worst side effects\nof extreme diets are rarely discussed since so few people\nstick with them, it also bears mentioning that many\nsocieties have unhealthy relationships with weight, and people are often pressured to diet for\nreasons other than health or happiness. So rather than trying to lose weight fast, we should all be taking our time \nto figure out what the healthiest lifestyle\nis for ourselves."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the major source of weight loss in the first four hours of fasting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Water (bounded to glycogen)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Glucose (blood sugar)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Protein (muscle mass)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fatty acid (fat mass)"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Minerals (bone mass) "}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "With energy deficit via exercise and dieting, when will the body start burning fat cells to meet the demand?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1-2 hours"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2-4 hours"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4-6 hours"}, {"label": "D", "text": "6-8 hours"}, {"label": "E", "text": "8-10 hours"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does the body primarily use for energy after 18 hours of fasting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vitamins"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Carbohydrates"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Minerals"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Protein"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Which of the followings is the least likely side effect of a prolonged detox diet, composed only of fruit and vegetable juices?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vitamin A toxicity (e.g. itchy and yellow skin)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Vitamin C deficiency (e.g. bleeding gums)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Protein deficiency (e.g. reduced muscle mass)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Compromised immune system (i.e. getting sick often)"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Essential fat deficiency (e.g. scaly dry skin)"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is false about resistance training during weight loss?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It helps maintaining muscle mass"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It assists individuals to burn calories even at rest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It improves one’s lipid profile"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is counterproductive towards weight loss"}, {"label": "E", "text": "It facilitates body fat reduction"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

The strangers knocked on every door \nin town, asking for food and shelter. But, again and again, \nthey were turned away. Soon, there was just one door left: that of a small, thatched shack. An elderly couple, Baucis and Philemon,\nanswered the thunderous knock. Although there was something\noff about these visitors, it was in the pair’s nature\nto care for those in need. Philemon invited them to rest, and the cottage flooded with warmth\nas Baucis teased the fire back to life.

The couple, at first relieved, \ngrew terrified. Their guests weren’t humble peasants\ntraveling the countryside. They were almost certainly gods \nin disguise— but which gods, \nthey didn’t know. Panicked that their preparations\nwere inadequate, Baucis and Philemon searched \nfor another offering. The only precious thing left was \nthe goose that guarded their home. The couple repeatedly lunged\nafter the bird, but they were too worn out for the chase. So, they prepared to receive\nthe wrath of the gods. Their guests rose up, \nshedding their rags and mortal masks. Looming before them was Zeus, \nthe storm-brewing ruler of the gods, and his son, Hermes, the fleet-footed messenger\nwho shepherded mortals to the underworld. The gods told the old couple that, \nunlike the other townspeople, they had shown true xenia, \nor loving hospitality to strangers. They alone had passed the test. The gods commanded the couple\nto follow them, and the group ascended\nthe nearest mountain. Nearing the summit, \nBaucis and Philemon looked back— but were shocked to see a murky swamp\nwhere their village stood just moments before. As punishment for refusing\nto shelter the gods, Zeus and Hermes had cast \nthe townspeople underwater, leaving only their hosts’ home intact, Recalling their friends and neighbors, Baucis and Philemon couldn’t hide\ntheir terror and mournful tears, even as their house transformed below. It grew larger and sprouted\nmarble pillars and steps. Legends etched themselves\nonto its grand doors. Their rickety cottage had metamorphosed\ninto a gleaming temple for the gods. Hermes commended the couple and gently\nasked if there was anything they desired. After a brief discussion, Philemon\nrequested that he and Baucis be permitted to care for the new temple. And he asked if, when their time came, \nthey could die together, so neither would have to face life\nwithout the other. Tending to the temple and one another, \nthey lived many more years. Until, one day, Baucis noticed leaves\nfluttering from her husband’s hands and looked down to find \nher own skin hardening. They embraced, becoming rooted in place. Vines wound around their legs \nand canopies flourished overhead. They bid each other a loving,\nlast farewell as humans. And where Baucis and Philemon \nhad just stood, bent with age, there towered a linden and an oak tree, their branches intertwined for eternity."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The strangers who came to the hillside town were what Gods in disguise?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Zeus and Apollo"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Zeus and Hermes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hera and Aphrodite"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hermes and Athena"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What alerted Baucis and Philemon to the fact that their guests were Gods?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The food"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The conversation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The wine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Their cloaks"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What did Baucis and Philemon attempt to catch as their final offering?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A goose"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A dog"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A lamb"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A cat"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The Gods transformed Baucis and Philemon’s house into:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A ramshackle cottage "}, {"label": "B", "text": "A forest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An underwater cave"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A temple"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "At the end of their human lives, Baucie and Philemon transformed into:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Geese"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Trees"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A temple"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Spiders"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

But there are no hobbits, dwarves,\nor Valkyries in this tale. In fact, the legend of the Ring of Gyges\nappeared long before those characters were ever committed to paper: more than 2,000 years ago, in the Greek philosopher Plato’s \n“Republic.” The story surfaces as the philosopher,\nSocrates, and his student, Glaucon, \ndiscuss why people act justly. Is it because it’s what’s right? Or because it’s a convention that’s\nenforced through punishment and reward? Playing devil’s advocate, \nGlaucon argues against Socrates and recounts the following story... Long ago, a shepherd named Gyges \nwas tending his flock when an earthquake struck, ripping an opening to the ground. The chasm drew Gyges in. There, his eyes alighted \nupon a bronze horse, the doors to its central chamber ajar. Peering inside, Gyges discovered \nthe corpse of a giant. On its finger, a golden ring, which Gyges pocketed \nbefore retracing his steps. Later, he sat among the other shepherds, fiddling with the mysterious\nring when, suddenly, after absentmindedly twirling its stone,\nhe became invisible. When he turned the stone back in the\nopposite direction, he reappeared. Emboldened by the ring’s powers, \nnew possibilities bloomed before him, and a sordid plan hatched in his mind. Gyges became a messenger\nto the king of Lydia, and, inside the palace, \nused the ring to prowl undetected. He seduced the queen and convinced\nher to betray her husband. And soon Gyges, once a humble shepherd, had murdered the monarch \nand claimed the kingdom. Glaucon tells this story to illustrate \nhow people can apparently benefit by acting unjustly. After all, wouldn’t any rational\nperson act like Gyges if presented the opportunity to get what\nthey desired without consequence? Exploring this argument, Glaucon breaks\nall good things into three classes. The first kinds, \nwe desire for their own sake, like the experience of harmless pleasure. The second, \nwe want only for the value they bring, though they may be onerous,\nlike exercise or medicine. The third class comprises things \nwe desire for their own sake and the value they offer, \nlike knowledge and health. Glaucon argues that justice belongs\nto the second class of good: it’s a burden that nevertheless\nbrings rewards. The only reason anyone conducts themselves\nvirtuously, he reasons, is due to external influences. So it’s appearing— not actually being—\nvirtuous that matters. Socrates, as written by Plato, disagrees, countering that justice belongs \nto the third class of good, offering both\nextrinsic and intrinsic benefits. Socrates argues that the human soul \nhas three parts: reason, spirit, and appetite. Reason guides an individual\nto truth and knowledge, and is influenced by either\nspirit or appetite. Spirit is righteous, ambitious,\nand the source of bold action, while appetite consists \nof baser, bodily desires. To Socrates, the philosopher\nis led by reason, and their spirit keeps \ntheir appetite in check, making them the most just\nand the happiest. Even without consequences \nfor self-serving wrongdoings, they wouldn't commit them. Meanwhile, the tyrant succumbs \nto appetite and acts unjustly. So, while Gyges may have attained\npower and wealth, Socrates implies that his soul\nwould be in disharmony. He’d be enslaved to his own base desires\nrather than guided by reason and wouldn't be truly happy. Before Plato penned this discussion, Chinese philosopher Confucius similarly\nreasoned that by simply acting justly, one also benefits oneself. After, modern Western philosophers voiced\nvarying beliefs. Thomas Hobbes, for instance, argued that the state of nature \nis violent and selfish. Justice, therefore, \nis imposed by authority. John Locke, in contrast, asserted \nthat people are naturally obligated to act justly and they agree \nto participate in civil society to secure their natural rights. The allegory of the ill-gotten\nmagical ring that lures its wearer towards their \ndarkest desires continues to inspire.

{"page": 121, "lesson": 12, "title": "What is a gig economy?", "category": "Business & Economics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/do-you-have-what-it-takes-to-freelance", "transcript": {"en": "The year is 1194. Maurice De Bracy, \nenemy to the English crown, is locked in combat\nwith a mysterious Black Knight. Suddenly, the Black Knight\ngains the upper hand. He whispers his true identity\nin De Bracy’s ear: King Richard the Lionheart of England. De Bracy yields. Later, De Bracy offers to let King Richard\nuse his army of “Free Lances,” mercenary soldiers who were free to use\ntheir lances in service of whoever paid the most. That’s how it plays out in Sir Walter \nScott’s 1819 novel, “Ivanhoe.” Scott didn’t coin the term,\nbut it was probably this use that stuck, and evolved to describe someone who works\nindependently of any single company. That independence seems\nto make people happy. A 2016 survey of freelancers\nin six countries found that those who freelance by choice—\n70% of respondents, by the way— were happier than people\nin traditional jobs, specifically when it came to things\nlike independence and flexibility in terms of where and when they work. In a survey conducted in the US, half of freelancers said there was \nno amount of money that would convince them to rejoin \nthe traditional workforce. At some point in your life—\nmaybe even now— you might wonder whether\nfreelancing is right for you. You'll need a few things to be successful. First, you'll need a skill\nthat's in demand. This can be as universal as driving a car\nto as specialized as neurosurgery, and it can be in pretty much any field. The more people who want your skill,\nand the fewer people who have it, the more you can charge for your services. Next, you’ll need to transform \nyourself into an entrepreneur. Before freelancers can do any work,\nthey have to find it. That takes marketing your services,\nnegotiating contracts, building a network of satisfied clients, and a whole set of administrative skills\nlike project management, time management, and accounting. And thirdly, if you can afford it, it's probably a good idea to budget\nfor some benefits for yourself and maybe your family. Freelancers don’t automatically get perks\nthat some salaried jobs offer, like paid vacation or sick leave, \nlife insurance, college tuition, or retirement plans. In countries like the US, where the government doesn’t provide\nhealthcare to most people, freelancers are responsible for that, too. Freelancing has been around\nfor a long time; but digital freelancing platforms like\nUber, Lyft, and Fiverr are pretty new. They say they’ll connect you with clients\nand take care of some of the entrepreneurial and administrative \nstuff so you can focus on the work. But there are some hidden costs\nto consider. First, your life may not be \nas flexible as you think. For example, if you're a rideshare driver,\nyou get to choose when to work, but not how: the app recommends what route to take, enforces how you act with the threat \nof low customer ratings, and sets your rate. Those rates may be so low \nthat you end up working more than if you had a salaried full-time job. Speaking of rates, it can be hard to figure out exactly \nhow much money you’ll make. Earnings vary based on location; platforms might advertise hourly rates\nthat don’t factor in expenses, and large scale data \non actual earnings is sparse. One of the largest data sets\nwe have is from Uber. It contains 740 million trips \nby 1.8 million drivers between 2015 and 2017. Researchers analyzed these figures\nin a 2018 paper and found that once you deduct Uber's cut\nand the cost of business expenses, drivers’ average earnings dropped from\nabout $22 an hour to about $12 an hour. And buying benefits would reduce\nthat number even more. And there is a lot of variability \nin working conditions across different gig platforms. For example, the company 99 in Brazil\noperates a rideshare platform that many people use to deliver packages. Drivers are matched with shippers,\nand 99 takes a cut. The company’s terms and conditions\nhold both the shipper and the driver liable for anything that could go wrong— including things like if a package \ngets stolen. If you’re considering joining \nthe app economy and don’t want to read all the fine print, there’s a network of researchers \nwho publish ratings of platforms based on five categories\nof fair employment. Digital gig platforms come with drawbacks and may not provide \na reliable living wage. But for many around the world \nwho don’t have the luxury of choice and need to make\nmoney as soon as possible, like, say, if you just lost your job, the gig economy is the easiest \nand fastest place to get hired. For this reason, some have called\nit an “alternative safety net.” So, considering all these factors\nand many others, should you dip your toes \ninto the gig economy? Or dive in? Ask yourself: how much do you value\nflexibility or autonomy? Do you prefer to work \nwithin an established structure, or to make your own? Are you willing to network \nto find new clients? Are you organized and self-directed? And perhaps most importantly, how much do you value knowing exactly\nwhat you'll earn from week to week?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who is most likely attributed for having popularized the use of the word “Free Lance?”", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Balzac"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sir Walter Scott"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dante"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nikolai Gogol"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to a US survey, what percentage of freelancers said there was no amount of money that would convince them to go back to the traditional workforce?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "30%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "40%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "60%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "According to the video, what is the benefit of freelancing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More independence and flexibility"}, {"label": "B", "text": "More health benefits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Easier time finding work"}, {"label": "D", "text": "More lucrative"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What might be a downside to freelancing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Being responsible for healthcare"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Being personally liable for mistakes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Unreliable or inconsistent wage"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In a study of 740 million uber trips, researchers found that when they accounted for costs incurred by drivers, their average earnings dropped from $22/hour to $___ /hour.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "8"}, {"label": "B", "text": "12"}, {"label": "C", "text": "14"}, {"label": "D", "text": "16"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "To make freelancing work, you’ll most likely need to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Have a skill that’s in demand"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Be entrepreneurial, organized, and self-directed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Budget for benefits"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
